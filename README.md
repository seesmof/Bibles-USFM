Contains some Bibles in USFM format for the glory of Jesus Christ our Holy Lord GOD Almighty ✝️💝🙏

All the Bibles were taken from [eBible](https://eBible.org/find/), a little tweak that was made to all of them is the Strong's numbers were removed everywhere ✝️💖📿

All of them are in Public Domain (which i believe all Bible translations should be) ✝️💟🙏
