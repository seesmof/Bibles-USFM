\mt2 The Good News According to 
\mt1 Luke 
\c 1  
\p
\v 1 Since many have undertaken to set in order a narrative concerning those matters which have been fulfilled amongst us, 
\v 2 even as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word delivered them to us, 
\v 3 it seemed good to me also, having traced the course of all things accurately from the first, to write to you in order, most excellent Theophilus; 
\v 4 that you might know the certainty concerning the things in which you were instructed. 
\p
\v 5 There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zechariah, of the priestly division of Abijah. He had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisheva. 
\v 6 They were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord. 
\v 7 But they had no child, because Elisheva was barren, and they both were well advanced in years. 
\p
\v 8 Now while he executed the priest’s office before God in the order of his division 
\v 9 according to the custom of the priest’s office, his lot was to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn incense. 
\v 10 The whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense. 
\p
\v 11 An angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right side of the altar of incense. 
\v 12 Zechariah was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him. 
\v 13 But the angel said to him, “Don’t be afraid, Zechariah, because your request has been heard. Your wife, Elisheva, will bear you a son, and you shall call his name Yochanan. 
\v 14 You will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth. 
\v 15 For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and he will drink no wine nor strong drink. He will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother’s womb. 
\v 16 He will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God. 
\v 17 He will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, ‘to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,’\x + \xo 1:17  \xt Malachi 4:6\x* and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to prepare a people prepared for the Lord.” 
\p
\v 18 Zechariah said to the angel, “How can I be sure of this? For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years.” 
\p
\v 19 The angel answered him, “I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God. I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news. 
\v 20 Behold,\f + \fr 1:20  \ft “Behold”, from “ἰδοὺ”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.\f* you will be silent and not able to speak until the day that these things will happen, because you didn’t believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their proper time.” 
\p
\v 21 The people were waiting for Zechariah, and they marvelled that he delayed in the temple. 
\v 22 When he came out, he could not speak to them. They perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple. He continued making signs to them, and remained mute. 
\v 23 When the days of his service were fulfilled, he departed to his house. 
\v 24 After these days Elisheva his wife conceived, and she hid herself five months, saying, 
\v 25 “Thus has the Lord done to me in the days in which he looked at me, to take away my reproach amongst men.” 
\p
\v 26 Now in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, 
\v 27 to a virgin pledged to be married to a man whose name was Joseph, of David’s house. The virgin’s name was Miriam. 
\v 28 Having come in, the angel said to her, “Rejoice, you highly favoured one! The Lord is with you. Blessed are you amongst women!” 
\p
\v 29 But when she saw him, she was greatly troubled at the saying, and considered what kind of salutation this might be. 
\v 30 The angel said to her, “Don’t be afraid, Miriam, for you have found favour with God. 
\v 31 Behold, you will conceive in your womb and give birth to a son, and shall name him ‘Yeshua.’ 
\v 32 He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, 
\v 33 and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever. There will be no end to his Kingdom.” 
\p
\v 34 Miriam said to the angel, “How can this be, seeing I am a virgin?” 
\p
\v 35 The angel answered her, “The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore also the holy one who is born from you will be called the Son of God. 
\v 36 Behold, Elisheva your relative also has conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren. 
\v 37 For nothing spoken by God is impossible.”\f + \fr 1:37  \ft or, “For everything spoken by God is possible.”\f* 
\p
\v 38 Miriam said, “Behold, the servant of the Lord; let it be done to me according to your word.” 
\p Then the angel departed from her. 
\p
\v 39 Miriam arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah, 
\v 40 and entered into the house of Zechariah and greeted Elisheva. 
\v 41 When Elisheva heard Miriam’s greeting, the baby leapt in her womb; and Elisheva was filled with the Holy Spirit. 
\v 42 She called out with a loud voice and said, “Blessed are you amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! 
\v 43 Why am I so favoured, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? 
\v 44 For behold, when the voice of your greeting came into my ears, the baby leapt in my womb for joy! 
\v 45 Blessed is she who believed, for there will be a fulfilment of the things which have been spoken to her from the Lord!” 
\p
\v 46 Miriam said, 
\q1 “My soul magnifies the Lord. 
\q2
\v 47 My spirit has rejoiced in God my Saviour, 
\q2
\v 48 for he has looked at the humble state of his servant. 
\q1 For behold, from now on, all generations will call me blessed. 
\q2
\v 49 For he who is mighty has done great things for me. 
\q2 Holy is his name. 
\q2
\v 50 His mercy is for generations and generations on those who fear him. 
\q1
\v 51 He has shown strength with his arm. 
\q2 He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts. 
\q1
\v 52 He has put down princes from their thrones, 
\q2 and has exalted the lowly. 
\q1
\v 53 He has filled the hungry with good things. 
\q2 He has sent the rich away empty. 
\q1
\v 54 He has given help to Israel, his servant, that he might remember mercy, 
\q2
\v 55 as he spoke to our fathers, 
\q2 to Abraham and his offspring\f + \fr 1:55  \ft or, seed\f* forever.” 
\p
\v 56 Miriam stayed with her about three months, and then returned to her house. 
\p
\v 57 Now the time that Elisheva should give birth was fulfilled, and she gave birth to a son. 
\v 58 Her neighbours and her relatives heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy towards her, and they rejoiced with her. 
\v 59 On the eighth day, they came to circumcise the child; and they would have called him Zechariah, after the name of his father. 
\v 60 His mother answered, “Not so; but he will be called Yochanan.” 
\p
\v 61 They said to her, “There is no one amongst your relatives who is called by this name.” 
\v 62 They made signs to his father, what he would have him called. 
\p
\v 63 He asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, “His name is Yochanan.” 
\p They all marvelled. 
\v 64 His mouth was opened immediately and his tongue freed, and he spoke, blessing God. 
\v 65 Fear came on all who lived around them, and all these sayings were talked about throughout all the hill country of Judea. 
\v 66 All who heard them laid them up in their heart, saying, “What then will this child be?” The hand of the Lord was with him. 
\p
\v 67 His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying, 
\q1
\v 68 “Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, 
\q2 for he has visited and redeemed his people; 
\q1
\v 69 and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David 
\q2
\v 70 (as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets who have been from of old), 
\q2
\v 71 salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us; 
\q1
\v 72 to show mercy towards our fathers, 
\q2 to remember his holy covenant, 
\q1
\v 73 the oath which he swore to Abraham our father, 
\q2
\v 74 to grant to us that we, being delivered out of the hand of our enemies, 
\q2 should serve him without fear, 
\q2
\v 75 in holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life. 
\q1
\v 76 And you, child, will be called a prophet of the Most High; 
\q2 for you will go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways, 
\q2
\v 77 to give knowledge of salvation to his people by the remission of their sins, 
\q1
\v 78 because of the tender mercy of our God, 
\q2 by which the dawn from on high will visit us, 
\q2
\v 79 to shine on those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death; 
\q2 to guide our feet into the way of peace.” 
\p
\v 80 The child was growing and becoming strong in spirit, and was in the desert until the day of his public appearance to Israel. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 Now in those days, a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be enrolled. 
\v 2 This was the first enrolment made when Quirinius was governor of Syria. 
\v 3 All went to enrol themselves, everyone to his own city. 
\v 4 Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to David’s city, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David, 
\v 5 to enrol himself with Miriam, who was pledged to be married to him as wife, being pregnant. 
\p
\v 6 While they were there, the day had come for her to give birth. 
\v 7 She gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped him in bands of cloth and laid him in a feeding trough, because there was no room for them in the inn. 
\p
\v 8 There were shepherds in the same country staying in the field, and keeping watch by night over their flock. 
\v 9 Behold, an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. 
\v 10 The angel said to them, “Don’t be afraid, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be to all the people. 
\v 11 For there is born to you today, in David’s city, a Saviour, who is Messiah\f + \fr 2:11  \ft “Messiah” means “Anointed One”.\f* the Lord. 
\v 12 This is the sign to you: you will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth, lying in a feeding trough.” 
\v 13 Suddenly, there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army praising God and saying, 
\q1
\v 14 “Glory to God in the highest, 
\q2 on earth peace, good will towards men.” 
\p
\v 15 When the angels went away from them into the sky, the shepherds said to one another, “Let’s go to Bethlehem, now, and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.” 
\v 16 They came with haste and found both Miriam and Joseph, and the baby was lying in the feeding trough. 
\v 17 When they saw it, they publicised widely the saying which was spoken to them about this child. 
\v 18 All who heard it wondered at the things which were spoken to them by the shepherds. 
\v 19 But Miriam kept all these sayings, pondering them in her heart. 
\v 20 The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, just as it was told them. 
\p
\v 21 When eight days were fulfilled for the circumcision of the child, his name was called Yeshua, which was given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb. 
\p
\v 22 When the days of their purification according to the Torah of Moses were fulfilled, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord 
\v 23 (as it is written in the Torah of the Lord, “Every male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord”),\x + \xo 2:23  \xt Exodus 13:2,12\x* 
\v 24 and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the Torah of the Lord, “A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.”\x + \xo 2:24  \xt Leviticus 12:8\x* 
\p
\v 25 Behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. This man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was on him. 
\v 26 It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord’s Messiah.\f + \fr 2:26  \ft “Christ” (Greek) and “Messiah” (Hebrew) both mean “Anointed One”\f* 
\v 27 He came in the Spirit into the temple. When the parents brought in the child, Yeshua, that they might do concerning him according to the requirement of the Torah, 
\v 28 then he received him into his arms and blessed God, and said, 
\q1
\v 29 “Now you are releasing your servant, Master, 
\q2 according to your word, in peace; 
\q1
\v 30 for my eyes have seen your salvation, 
\q2
\v 31 which you have prepared before the face of all peoples; 
\q1
\v 32 a light for revelation to the nations, 
\q2 and the glory of your people Israel.” 
\p
\v 33 Joseph and his mother were marvelling at the things which were spoken concerning him. 
\v 34 Simeon blessed them, and said to Miriam, his mother, “Behold, this child is appointed for the falling and the rising of many in Israel, and for a sign which is spoken against. 
\v 35 Yes, a sword will pierce through your own soul, that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.” 
\p
\v 36 There was one Hannah, a prophetess, the daughter of Penuel, of the tribe of Asher (she was of a great age, having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity, 
\v 37 and she had been a widow for about eighty-four years), who didn’t depart from the temple, worshipping with fastings and petitions night and day. 
\v 38 Coming up at that very hour, she gave thanks to the Lord, and spoke of him to all those who were looking for redemption in Jerusalem. 
\p
\v 39 When they had accomplished all things that were according to the Torah of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth. 
\v 40 The child was growing, and was becoming strong in spirit, being filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him. 
\p
\v 41 His parents went every year to Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover. 
\v 42 When he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast; 
\v 43 and when they had fulfilled the days, as they were returning, the boy Yeshua stayed behind in Jerusalem. Joseph and his mother didn’t know it, 
\v 44 but supposing him to be in the company, they went a day’s journey; and they looked for him amongst their relatives and acquaintances. 
\v 45 When they didn’t find him, they returned to Jerusalem, looking for him. 
\v 46 After three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the middle of the teachers, both listening to them and asking them questions. 
\v 47 All who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers. 
\v 48 When they saw him, they were astonished; and his mother said to him, “Son, why have you treated us this way? Behold, your father and I were anxiously looking for you.” 
\p
\v 49 He said to them, \wj “\+w Why\+w* \+w were\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w looking\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w me\+w*? Didn’\+w t\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w know\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w must\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w Father\+w*’s house?”\wj* 
\v 50 They didn’t understand the saying which he spoke to them. 
\v 51 And he went down with them and came to Nazareth. He was subject to them, and his mother kept all these sayings in her heart. 
\v 52 And Yeshua increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and men.

\p
\v 1 Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene, 
\v 2 during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to Yochanan, the son of Zechariah, in the wilderness. 
\v 3 He came into all the region around the Jordan, proclaiming the immersion of repentance for remission of sins. 
\v 4 As it is written in the scroll of the words of Isaiah the prophet, 
\q1 “The voice of one crying in the wilderness, 
\q2 ‘Make ready the way of the Lord. 
\q1 Make his paths straight. 
\q2
\v 5 Every valley will be filled. 
\q1 Every mountain and hill will be brought low. 
\q2 The crooked will become straight, 
\q2 and the rough ways smooth. 
\q1
\v 6 All flesh will see God’s salvation.’”\x + \xo 3:6  \xt Isaiah 40:3-5\x* 
\p
\v 7 He said therefore to the multitudes who went out to be immersed by him, “You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? 
\v 8 Therefore produce fruits worthy of repentance, and don’t begin to say amongst yourselves, ‘We have Abraham for our father;’ for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones! 
\v 9 Even now the axe also lies at the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that doesn’t produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.” 
\p
\v 10 The multitudes asked him, “What then must we do?” 
\p
\v 11 He answered them, “He who has two coats, let him give to him who has none. He who has food, let him do likewise.” 
\p
\v 12 Tax collectors also came to be immersed, and they said to him, “Rabbi, what must we do?” 
\p
\v 13 He said to them, “Collect no more than that which is appointed to you.” 
\p
\v 14 Soldiers also asked him, saying, “What about us? What must we do?” 
\p He said to them, “Extort from no one by violence, neither accuse anyone wrongfully. Be content with your wages.” 
\p
\v 15 As the people were in expectation, and all men reasoned in their hearts concerning Yochanan, whether perhaps he was the Messiah, 
\v 16 Yochanan answered them all, “I indeed immerse you with water, but he comes who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to loosen. He will immerse you in the Holy Spirit and fire. 
\v 17 His winnowing fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor, and will gather the wheat into his barn; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.” 
\p
\v 18 Then with many other exhortations he preached good news to the people, 
\v 19 but Herod the tetrarch,\f + \fr 3:19  \ft a tetrarch is one of four governors of a province\f* being reproved by him for Herodias, his brother’s\f + \fr 3:19  \ft TR reads “brother Philip’s” instead of “brother’s”\f* wife, and for all the evil things which Herod had done, 
\v 20 added this also to them all, that he shut up Yochanan in prison. 
\p
\v 21 Now when all the people were immersed, Yeshua also had been immersed and was praying. The sky was opened, 
\v 22 and the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily form like a dove on him; and a voice came out of the sky, saying “You are my beloved Son. In you I am well pleased.” 
\p
\v 23 Yeshua himself, when he began to teach, was about thirty years old, being the son (as was supposed) of Joseph, the son of Eli, 
\v 24 the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph, 
\v 25 the son of Mattithiah, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai, 
\v 26 the son of Maath, the son of Mattithiah, the son of Shimei, the son of Joseph, the son of Judah, 
\v 27 the son of Yochanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri, 
\v 28 the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmodam, the son of Er, 
\v 29 the son of Yosi, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, 
\v 30 the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonan, the son of Eliakim, 
\v 31 the son of Maleah, the son of Manah, the son of Mattathah, the son of Nathan, the son of David, 
\v 32 the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon, the son of Nahshon, 
\v 33 the son of Amminadab, the son of Ram,\f + \fr 3:33  \ft NU reads “Admin, the son of Arni” instead of “Ram”\f* the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah, 
\v 34 the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor, 
\v 35 the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Shelah, 
\v 36 the son of Kenan, the son of Arpachshad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech, 
\v 37 the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalalel, the son of Kenan, 
\v 38 the son of Enosh, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 Yeshua, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness 
\v 2 for forty days, being tempted by the devil. He ate nothing in those days. Afterward, when they were completed, he was hungry. 
\p
\v 3 The devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread.” 
\p
\v 4 Yeshua answered him, saying, \wj “\+w It\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w written\+w*, ‘\+w Man\+w* \+w shall\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w live\+w* \+w by\+w* bread \+w alone\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w by\+w* \+w every\+w* \+w word\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w God\+w*.’”\wj*\x + \xo 4:4  \xt Deuteronomy 8:3\x* 
\p
\v 5 The devil, leading him up on a high mountain, showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. 
\v 6 The devil said to him, “I will give you all this authority and their glory, for it has been delivered to me, and I give it to whomever I want. 
\v 7 If you therefore will worship before me, it will all be yours.” 
\p
\v 8 Yeshua answered him, \wj “\+w Get\+w* behind \+w me\+w*, Satan! \+w For\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w written\+w*, ‘\+w You\+w* \+w shall\+w* \+w worship\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Lord\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w God\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w shall\+w* \+w serve\+w* \+w him\+w* \+w only\+w*.’”\wj*\x + \xo 4:8  \xt Deuteronomy 6:13\x* 
\p
\v 9 He led him to Jerusalem and set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down from here, 
\v 10 for it is written, 
\q1 ‘He will put his angels in charge of you, to guard you;’ 
\p
\v 11 and, 
\q1 ‘On their hands they will bear you up, 
\q2 lest perhaps you dash your foot against a stone.’”\x + \xo 4:11  \xt Psalms 91:11-12 \x* 
\p
\v 12 Yeshua answering, said to him, \wj “\+w It\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w been\+w* \+w said\+w*, ‘\+w You\+w* \+w shall\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w tempt\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Lord\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w God\+w*.’”\wj*\x + \xo 4:12  \xt Deuteronomy 6:16\x* 
\p
\v 13 When the devil had completed every temptation, he departed from him until another time. 
\p
\v 14 Yeshua returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee, and news about him spread through all the surrounding area. 
\v 15 He taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all. 
\p
\v 16 He came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up. He entered, as was his custom, into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read. 
\v 17 The scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. He opened the scroll, and found the place where it was written, 
\q1
\v 18  \wj “\+w The\+w* \+w Spirit\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Lord\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w me\+w*,\wj*

\v 20 He closed the scroll, gave it back to the shammash, and sat down. The eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on him. 
\v 21 He began to tell them, \wj “\+w Today\+w*, \+w this\+w* \+w Scripture\+w* \+w has\+w* been \+w fulfilled\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w hearing\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 22 All testified about him and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth; and they said, “Isn’t this Joseph’s son?” 
\p
\v 23 He said to them, \wj “Doubtless \+w you\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w this\+w* \+w proverb\+w*, ‘\+w Physician\+w*, \+w heal\+w* \+w yourself\+w*! \+w Whatever\+w* \+w we\+w* \+w have\+w* heard \+w done\+w* \+w at\+w* \+w Capernaum\+w*, \+w do\+w* \+w also\+w* \+w here\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w hometown\+w*.’”\wj* 
\v 24 He said, \wj “Most certainly \+w I\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w*, \+w no\+w* \+w prophet\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w acceptable\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w his\+w* \+w hometown\+w*. \wj*

\p
\v 28 They were all filled with wrath in the synagogue as they heard these things. 
\v 29 They rose up, threw him out of the city, and led him to the brow of the hill that their city was built on, that they might throw him off the cliff. 
\v 30 But he, passing through the middle of them, went his way. 
\p
\v 31 He came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. He was teaching them on the Sabbath day, 
\v 32 and they were astonished at his teaching, for his word was with authority. 
\v 33 In the synagogue there was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon; and he cried out with a loud voice, 
\v 34 saying, “Ah! what have we to do with you, Yeshua of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are: the Holy One of God!” 
\p
\v 35 Yeshua rebuked him, saying, \wj “\+w Be\+w* silent \+w and\+w* \+w come\+w* \+w out\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w him\+w*!” \wj* When the demon had thrown him down in the middle of them, he came out of him, having done him no harm. 
\p
\v 36 Amazement came on all and they spoke together, one with another, saying, “What is this word? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out!” 
\v 37 News about him went out into every place of the surrounding region. 
\p
\v 38 He rose up from the synagogue and entered into Simon’s house. Simon’s mother-in-law was afflicted with a great fever, and they begged him to help her. 
\v 39 He stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. Immediately she rose up and served them. 
\v 40 When the sun was setting, all those who had any sick with various diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them. 
\v 41 Demons also came out of many, crying out and saying, “You are the Messiah, the Son of God!” Rebuking them, he didn’t allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Messiah. 
\p
\v 42 When it was day, he departed and went into an uninhabited place and the multitudes looked for him, and came to him, and held on to him, so that he wouldn’t go away from them. 
\v 43 But he said to them, \wj “\+w I\+w* \+w must\+w* \+w proclaim\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w good\+w* \+w news\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w God\+w*’s Kingdom \+w to\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w other\+w* \+w cities\+w* \+w also\+w*. \+w For\+w* \+w this\+w* reason \+w I\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w been\+w* \+w sent\+w*.”\wj* 
\v 44 He was proclaiming in the synagogues of Galilee. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 Now while the multitude pressed on him and heard the word of God, he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret. 
\v 2 He saw two boats standing by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets. 
\v 3 He entered into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, and asked him to put out a little from the land. He sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat. 
\p
\v 4 When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, \wj “\+w Put\+w* \+w out\+w* \+w into\+w* \+w the\+w* deep \+w and\+w* \+w let\+w* \+w down\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w nets\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w a\+w* catch.”\wj* 
\p
\v 5 Simon answered him, “Master, we worked all night and caught nothing; but at your word I will let down the net.” 
\v 6 When they had done this, they caught a great multitude of fish, and their net was breaking. 
\v 7 They beckoned to their partners in the other boat, that they should come and help them. They came and filled both boats, so that they began to sink. 
\v 8 But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Yeshua’s knees, saying, “Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord.” 
\v 9 For he was amazed, and all who were with him, at the catch of fish which they had caught; 
\v 10 and so also were Jacob and Yochanan, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. 
\p Yeshua said to Simon, \wj “Don’\+w t\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w afraid\+w*. \+w From\+w* \+w now\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w catching\+w* \+w people\+w* alive.”\wj* 
\p
\v 11 When they had brought their boats to land, they left everything, and followed him. 
\p
\v 12 While he was in one of the cities, behold, there was a man full of leprosy. When he saw Yeshua, he fell on his face and begged him, saying, “Lord, if you want to, you can make me clean.” 
\p
\v 13 He stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, \wj “\+w I\+w* \+w want\+w* \+w to\+w*. \+w Be\+w* \+w made\+w* \+w clean\+w*.”\wj* 
\p Immediately the leprosy left him. 
\v 14 He commanded him to tell no one, \wj “\+w But\+w* \+w go\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w way\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w show\+w* \+w yourself\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w priest\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w offer\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w cleansing\+w* \+w according\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w what\+w* \+w Moses\+w* \+w commanded\+w*, \+w for\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w testimony\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w them\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 15 But the report concerning him spread much more, and great multitudes came together to hear and to be healed by him of their infirmities. 
\v 16 But he withdrew himself into the desert and prayed. 
\p
\v 17 On one of those days, he was teaching; and there were Pharisees and teachers of the Torah sitting by who had come out of every village of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem. The power of the Lord was with him to heal them. 
\v 18 Behold, men brought a paralysed man on a cot, and they sought to bring him in to lay before Yeshua. 
\v 19 Not finding a way to bring him in because of the multitude, they went up to the housetop and let him down through the tiles with his cot into the middle before Yeshua. 
\v 20 Seeing their faith, he said to him, \wj “Man, \+w your\+w* sins \+w are\+w* forgiven \+w you\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 21 The scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, “Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?” 
\p
\v 22 But Yeshua, perceiving their thoughts, answered them, \wj “\+w Why\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w reasoning\+w* \+w so\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w hearts\+w*? \wj* 
\v 23  \wj \+w Which\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w easier\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w say\+w*, ‘\+w Your\+w* sins \+w are\+w* forgiven \+w you\+w*,’ \+w or\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w say\+w*, ‘\+w Arise\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w walk\+w*’? \wj* 
\v 24  \wj \+w But\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w may\+w* \+w know\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Son\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Man\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w authority\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w earth\+w* \+w to\+w* forgive sins,”\wj* he said to the paralysed man, \wj “\+w I\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w*, \+w arise\+w*, \+w take\+w* \+w up\+w* \+w your\+w* cot, \+w and\+w* \+w go\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w house\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 25 Immediately he rose up before them, and took up that which he was laying on, and departed to his house, glorifying God. 
\v 26 Amazement took hold on all, and they glorified God. They were filled with fear, saying, “We have seen strange things today.” 
\p
\v 27 After these things he went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax office, and said to him, \wj “\+w Follow\+w* \+w me\+w*!”\wj* 
\p
\v 28 He left everything, and rose up and followed him. 
\v 29 Levi made a great feast for him in his house. There was a great crowd of tax collectors and others who were reclining with them. 
\v 30 Their scribes and the Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, “Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?” 
\p
\v 31 Yeshua answered them, \wj “\+w Those\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w are\+w* healthy \+w have\+w* \+w no\+w* \+w need\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w physician\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w those\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w sick\+w* \+w do\+w*. \wj*

\p
\v 33 They said to him, “Why do Yochanan’s disciples often fast and pray, likewise also the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink?” 
\p
\v 34 He said to them, \wj “\+w Can\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w make\+w* \+w the\+w* friends \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w bridegroom\+w* \+w fast\+w* \+w while\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w bridegroom\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w them\+w*? \wj* 
\v 35  \wj \+w But\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w days\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w come\+w* \+w when\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w bridegroom\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w be\+w* taken away \+w from\+w* \+w them\+w*. \+w Then\+w* \+w they\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w fast\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w those\+w* \+w days\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 36 He also told a parable to them. \wj “\+w No\+w* \+w one\+w* \+w puts\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w piece\+w* \+w from\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w new\+w* \+w garment\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w an\+w* \+w old\+w* \+w garment\+w*, \+w or\+w* \+w else\+w* \+w he\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w tear\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w new\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w also\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w piece\+w* \+w from\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w new\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w match\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w old\+w*. \wj*

\c 6  
\p
\v 1 Now on the second Sabbath after the first, he was going through the grain fields. His disciples plucked the heads of grain and ate, rubbing them in their hands. 
\v 2 But some of the Pharisees said to them, “Why do you do that which is not lawful to do on the Sabbath day?” 
\p
\v 3 Yeshua, answering them, said, \wj “Haven’\+w t\+w* \+w you\+w* read \+w what\+w* \+w David\+w* \+w did\+w* \+w when\+w* \+w he\+w* \+w was\+w* \+w hungry\+w*, \+w he\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w those\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w were\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w him\+w*, \wj*

\v 5 He said to them, \wj “\+w The\+w* \+w Son\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Man\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w lord\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Sabbath\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 6 It also happened on another Sabbath that he entered into the synagogue and taught. There was a man there, and his right hand was withered. 
\v 7 The scribes and the Pharisees watched him, to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath, that they might find an accusation against him. 
\v 8 But he knew their thoughts; and he said to the man who had the withered hand, \wj “\+w Rise\+w* \+w up\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w stand\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w middle\+w*.”\wj* He arose and stood. 
\v 9 Then Yeshua said to them, \wj “\+w I\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w ask\+w* \+w you\+w* something: \+w Is\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w lawful\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Sabbath\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w good\+w*, \+w or\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w harm\+w*? \+w To\+w* \+w save\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w life\+w*, \+w or\+w* \+w to\+w* kill?”\wj* 
\v 10 He looked around at them all, and said to the man, \wj “\+w Stretch\+w* \+w out\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w hand\+w*.”\wj* He did, and his hand was restored as sound as the other. 
\v 11 But they were filled with rage, and talked with one another about what they might do to Yeshua. 
\p
\v 12 In these days, he went out to the mountain to pray, and he continued all night in prayer to God. 
\v 13 When it was day, he called his disciples, and from them he chose twelve, whom he also named emissaries: 
\v 14 Simon, whom he also named Peter; Andrew, his brother; Jacob; Yochanan; Philip; Bartholomew; 
\v 15 Matthew; Thomas; Jacob the son of Halfai; Simon who was called the Zealot; 
\v 16 Judah the son of Jacob; and Judah Iscariot, who also became a traitor. 
\p
\v 17 He came down with them and stood on a level place, with a crowd of his disciples and a great number of the people from all Judea and Jerusalem and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases, 
\v 18 as well as those who were troubled by unclean spirits; and they were being healed. 
\v 19 All the multitude sought to touch him, for power came out of him and healed them all. 
\p
\v 20 He lifted up his eyes to his disciples, and said:

\v 1 After he had finished speaking in the hearing of the people, he entered into Capernaum. 
\v 2 A certain centurion’s servant, who was dear to him, was sick and at the point of death. 
\v 3 When he heard about Yeshua, he sent to him Jewish elders, asking him to come and save his servant. 
\v 4 When they came to Yeshua, they begged him earnestly, saying, “He is worthy for you to do this for him, 
\v 5 for he loves our nation, and he built our synagogue for us.” 
\v 6 Yeshua went with them. When he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, “Lord, don’t trouble yourself, for I am not worthy for you to come under my roof. 
\v 7 Therefore I didn’t even think myself worthy to come to you; but say the word, and my servant will be healed. 
\v 8 For I also am a man placed under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, ‘Go!’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come!’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.” 
\p
\v 9 When Yeshua heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned and said to the multitude who followed him, \wj “\+w I\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w*, \+w I\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w found\+w* \+w such\+w* \+w great\+w* \+w faith\+w*, \+w no\+w*, \+w not\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w Israel\+w*.”\wj* 
\v 10 Those who were sent, returning to the house, found that the servant who had been sick was well. 
\p
\v 11 Soon afterwards, he went to a city called Nain. Many of his disciples, along with a great multitude, went with him. 
\v 12 Now when he came near to the gate of the city, behold, one who was dead was carried out, the only born\f + \fr 7:12  \ft The phrase “only born” is from the Greek word “μονογενη”, which is sometimes translated “only begotten” or “one and only”. \f* son of his mother, and she was a widow. Many people of the city were with her. 
\v 13 When the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her and said to her, \wj “Don’\+w t\+w* cry.”\wj* 
\v 14 He came near and touched the coffin, and the bearers stood still. He said, \wj “\+w Young\+w* \+w man\+w*, \+w I\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w*, \+w arise\+w*!”\wj* 
\v 15 He who was dead sat up and began to speak. Then he gave him to his mother. 
\p
\v 16 Fear took hold of all, and they glorified God, saying, “A great prophet has arisen amongst us!” and, “God has visited his people!” 
\v 17 This report went out concerning him in the whole of Judea and in all the surrounding region. 
\p
\v 18 The disciples of Yochanan told him about all these things. 
\v 19 Yochanan, calling to himself two of his disciples, sent them to Yeshua, saying, “Are you the one who is coming, or should we look for another?” 
\v 20 When the men had come to him, they said, “Yochanan the Immerser has sent us to you, saying, ‘Are you he who comes, or should we look for another?’” 
\p
\v 21 In that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits; and to many who were blind he gave sight.

\v 38 Standing behind at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and she wiped them with the hair of her head, kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment. 
\v 39 Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it, he said to himself, “This man, if he were a prophet, would have perceived who and what kind of woman this is who touches him, that she is a sinner.”

\v 40 Yeshua answered him, \wj “\+w Simon\+w*, \+w I\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w something\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w*.” \wj*

\v 49 Those who sat at the table with him began to say to themselves, “Who is this who even forgives sins?”

\v 1 Soon afterwards, he went about through cities and villages, proclaiming and bringing the good news of God’s Kingdom. With him were the twelve, 
\v 2 and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Miriam who was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out; 
\v 3 and Yochanah, the wife of Kuza, Herod’s steward; Shoshanah; and many others who served them\f + \fr 8:3  \ft TR reads “him” instead of “them”\f* from their possessions. 
\v 4 When a great multitude came together and people from every city were coming to him, he spoke by a parable:

\v 19 His mother and brothers came to him, and they could not come near him for the crowd. 
\v 20 Some people told him, “Your mother and your brothers stand outside, desiring to see you.” 
\p
\v 21 But he answered them, \wj “\+w My\+w* \+w mother\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w my\+w* brothers \+w are\+w* \+w these\+w* \+w who\+w* hear \+w the\+w* \+w word\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w God\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w it\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 22 Now on one of those days, he entered into a boat, himself and his disciples, and he said to them, \wj “\+w Let\+w*’s \+w go\+w* \+w over\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w other\+w* \+w side\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w lake\+w*.”\wj* So they launched out. 
\v 23 But as they sailed, he fell asleep. A wind storm came down on the lake, and they were taking on dangerous amounts of water. 
\v 24 They came to him and awoke him, saying, “Master, Master, we are dying!” He awoke and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water; then they ceased, and it was calm.\x + \xo 8:24  \xt See Psalms 107:29\x* 
\v 25 He said to them, \wj “\+w Where\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w faith\+w*?”\wj* Being afraid, they marvelled, saying to one another, “Who is this then, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?” 
\p
\v 26 Then they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee. 
\v 27 When Yeshua stepped ashore, a certain man out of the city who had demons for a long time met him. He wore no clothes, and didn’t live in a house, but in the tombs. 
\v 28 When he saw Yeshua, he cried out and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, “What do I have to do with you, Yeshua, you Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don’t torment me!” 
\v 29 For Yeshua was commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For the unclean spirit had often seized the man. He was kept under guard and bound with chains and fetters. Breaking the bonds apart, he was driven by the demon into the desert. 
\p
\v 30 Yeshua asked him, \wj “\+w What\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w name\+w*?”\wj* 
\p He said, “Legion,” for many demons had entered into him. 
\v 31 They begged him that he would not command them to go into the abyss. 
\p
\v 32 Now there was there a herd of many pigs feeding on the mountain, and they begged him that he would allow them to enter into those. Then he allowed them. 
\v 33 The demons came out of the man and entered into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned. 
\p
\v 34 When those who fed them saw what had happened, they fled and told it in the city and in the country. 
\p
\v 35 People went out to see what had happened. They came to Yeshua and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Yeshua’s feet, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. 
\v 36 Those who saw it told them how he who had been possessed by demons was healed. 
\v 37 All the people of the surrounding country of the Gadarenes asked him to depart from them, for they were very much afraid. Then he entered into the boat and returned. 
\v 38 But the man from whom the demons had gone out begged him that he might go with him, but Yeshua sent him away, saying, 
\v 39  \wj “\+w Return\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w house\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w declare\+w* \+w what\+w* \+w great\+w* \+w things\+w* \+w God\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w done\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w you\+w*.”\wj* He went his way, proclaiming throughout the whole city what great things Yeshua had done for him. 
\p
\v 40 When Yeshua returned, the multitude welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him. 
\v 41 Behold, a man named Jairus came. He was a ruler of the synagogue. He fell down at Yeshua’s feet and begged him to come into his house, 
\v 42 for he had an only born\f + \fr 8:42  \ft The phrase “only born” is from the Greek word “μονογενη”, which is sometimes translated “only begotten” or “one and only”.\f* daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as he went, the multitudes pressed against him. 
\v 43 A woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years, who had spent all her living on physicians and could not be healed by any, 
\v 44 came behind him and touched the fringe\f + \fr 8:44  \ft or, tassel\f* of his cloak. Immediately the flow of her blood stopped. 
\p
\v 45 Yeshua said, \wj “\+w Who\+w* touched \+w me\+w*?”\wj* 
\p When all denied it, Peter and those with him said, “Master, the multitudes press and jostle you, and you say, \wj ‘\+w Who\+w* touched \+w me\+w*?’\wj*” 
\p
\v 46 But Yeshua said, \wj “\+w Someone\+w* \+w did\+w* touch \+w me\+w*, \+w for\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w perceived\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w power\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w gone\+w* \+w out\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w me\+w*.”\wj* 
\v 47 When the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling; and falling down before him declared to him in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately. 
\v 48 He said to her, \wj “\+w Daughter\+w*, cheer \+w up\+w*. \+w Your\+w* \+w faith\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w made\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w well\+w*. \+w Go\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w peace\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 49 While he still spoke, one from the ruler of the synagogue’s house came, saying to him, “Your daughter is dead. Don’t trouble the Rabbi.” 
\p
\v 50 But Yeshua hearing it, answered him, \wj “Don’\+w t\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w afraid\+w*. \+w Only\+w* \+w believe\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w she\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w healed\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 51 When he came to the house, he didn’t allow anyone to enter in, except Peter, Yochanan, Jacob, the father of the child, and her mother. 
\v 52 All were weeping and mourning her, but he said, \wj “Don’\+w t\+w* \+w weep\+w*. \+w She\+w* isn’\+w t\+w* dead, \+w but\+w* \+w sleeping\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 53 They were ridiculing him, knowing that she was dead. 
\v 54 But he put them all outside, and taking her by the hand, he called, saying, \wj “\+w Child\+w*, \+w arise\+w*!”\wj* 
\v 55 Her spirit returned, and she rose up immediately. He commanded that something be given to her to eat. 
\v 56 Her parents were amazed, but he commanded them to tell no one what had been done. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 He called the twelve\f + \fr 9:1  \ft TR reads “his twelve disciples” instead of “the twelve”\f* together and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases. 
\v 2 He sent them out to proclaim God’s Kingdom and to heal the sick. 
\v 3 He said to them, \wj “\+w Take\+w* \+w nothing\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w journey\+w*—\+w no\+w* staffs, \+w nor\+w* wallet, \+w nor\+w* bread, \+w nor\+w* money. Don’\+w t\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w two\+w* \+w tunics\+w* \+w each\+w*. \wj*

\p
\v 6 They departed and went throughout the villages, proclaiming the Good News and healing everywhere. 
\p
\v 7 Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him; and he was very perplexed, because it was said by some that Yochanan had risen from the dead, 
\v 8 and by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the old prophets had risen again. 
\v 9 Herod said, “I beheaded Yochanan, but who is this about whom I hear such things?” He sought to see him. 
\p
\v 10 The emissaries, when they had returned, told him what things they had done. 
\p He took them and withdrew apart to a desert region of\f + \fr 9:10  \ft NU omits “a desert region of”.\f* a city called Bethsaida. 
\v 11 But the multitudes, perceiving it, followed him. He welcomed them, spoke to them of God’s Kingdom, and he cured those who needed healing. 
\v 12 The day began to wear away; and the twelve came and said to him, “Send the multitude away, that they may go into the surrounding villages and farms and lodge and get food, for we are here in a deserted place.” 
\p
\v 13 But he said to them, \wj “\+w You\+w* \+w give\+w* \+w them\+w* \+w something\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w eat\+w*.”\wj* 
\p They said, “We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we should go and buy food for all these people.” 
\v 14 For they were about five thousand men. 
\p He said to his disciples, \wj “\+w Make\+w* \+w them\+w* \+w sit\+w* \+w down\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w groups\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w about\+w* \+w fifty\+w* \+w each\+w*.”\wj* 
\v 15 They did so, and made them all sit down. 
\v 16 He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to the sky, he blessed them, broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the multitude. 
\v 17 They ate and were all filled. They gathered up twelve baskets of broken pieces that were left over. 
\p
\v 18 As he was praying alone, the disciples were near him, and he asked them, \wj “\+w Who\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w multitudes\+w* \+w say\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w am\+w*?”\wj*

\p
\v 28 About eight days after these sayings, he took with him Peter, Yochanan, and Jacob, and went up onto the mountain to pray. 
\v 29 As he was praying, the appearance of his face was altered, and his clothing became white and dazzling. 
\v 30 Behold, two men were talking with him, who were Moses and Elijah, 
\v 31 who appeared in glory and spoke of his departure,\f + \fr 9:31  \ft literally, “exodus”\f* which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem. 
\p
\v 32 Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep, but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory, and the two men who stood with him. 
\v 33 As they were parting from him, Peter said to Yeshua, “Master, it is good for us to be here. Let’s make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah,” not knowing what he said. 
\p
\v 34 While he said these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud. 
\v 35 A voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is my beloved Son. Listen to him!” 
\v 36 When the voice came, Yeshua was found alone. They were silent, and told no one in those days any of the things which they had seen. 
\p
\v 37 On the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great multitude met him. 
\v 38 Behold, a man from the crowd called out, saying, “Rabbi, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only born\f + \fr 9:38  \ft The phrase “only born” is from the Greek word “μονογενη”, which is sometimes translated “only begotten” or “one and only”.\f* child. 
\v 39 Behold, a spirit takes him, he suddenly cries out, and it convulses him so that he foams; and it hardly departs from him, bruising him severely. 
\v 40 I begged your disciples to cast it out, and they couldn’t.” 
\p
\v 41 Yeshua answered, \wj “Faithless \+w and\+w* \+w perverse\+w* \+w generation\+w*, \+w how\+w* \+w long\+w* \+w shall\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w bear\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w you\+w*? \+w Bring\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w son\+w* \+w here\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 42 While he was still coming, the demon threw him down and convulsed him violently. But Yeshua rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the boy, and gave him back to his father. 
\v 43 They were all astonished at the majesty of God. 
\p But while all were marvelling at all the things which Yeshua did, he said to his disciples, 
\v 44  \wj “\+w Let\+w* \+w these\+w* \+w words\+w* \+w sink\+w* \+w into\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w ears\+w*, \+w for\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Son\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Man\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w delivered\+w* \+w up\+w* \+w into\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w hands\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w men\+w*.”\wj* 
\v 45 But they didn’t understand this saying. It was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it, and they were afraid to ask him about this saying. 
\p
\v 46 An argument arose amongst them about which of them was the greatest. 
\v 47 Yeshua, perceiving the reasoning of their hearts, took a little child, and set him by his side, 
\v 48 and said to them, \wj “\+w Whoever\+w* \+w receives\+w* \+w this\+w* \+w little\+w* \+w child\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w name\+w* \+w receives\+w* \+w me\+w*. \+w Whoever\+w* \+w receives\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w receives\+w* \+w him\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w sent\+w* \+w me\+w*. \+w For\+w* \+w whoever\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w least\+w* amongst \+w you\+w* \+w all\+w*, \+w this\+w* \+w one\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w great\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 49 Yochanan answered, “Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we forbade him, because he doesn’t follow with us.” 
\p
\v 50 Yeshua said to him, \wj “Don’t \+w forbid\+w* \+w him\+w*, \+w for\+w* \+w he\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w against\+w* \+w us\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w us\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 51 It came to pass, when the days were near that he should be taken up, he intently set his face to go to Jerusalem 
\v 52 and sent messengers before his face. They went and entered into a village of the Samaritans, so as to prepare for him. 
\v 53 They didn’t receive him, because he was travelling with his face set towards Jerusalem. 
\v 54 When his disciples, Jacob and Yochanan, saw this, they said, “Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from the sky and destroy them, just as Elijah did?” 
\p
\v 55 But he turned and rebuked them, \wj “You don’t know \+w of\+w* \+w what\+w* kind \+w of\+w* spirit you are. \wj* 
\v 56  \wj \+w For\+w* \+w the\+w* Son \+w of\+w* \+w Man\+w* didn’t \+w come\+w* \+w to\+w* destroy men’s lives, \+w but\+w* \+w to\+w* save \+w them\+w*.”\wj* 
\p They went to another village. 
\v 57 As they went on the way, a certain man said to him, “I want to follow you wherever you go, Lord.” 
\p
\v 58 Yeshua said to him, \wj “\+w The\+w* foxes \+w have\+w* \+w holes\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w birds\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w sky\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w nests\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Son\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Man\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w no\+w* \+w place\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w lay\+w* \+w his\+w* \+w head\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 59 He said to another, \wj “\+w Follow\+w* \+w me\+w*!”\wj* 
\p But he said, “Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.” 
\p
\v 60 But Yeshua said to him, \wj “Leave \+w the\+w* \+w dead\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w bury\+w* \+w their\+w* \+w own\+w* \+w dead\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w you\+w* go \+w and\+w* announce \+w God\+w*’s Kingdom.”\wj* 
\p
\v 61 Another also said, “I want to follow you, Lord, but first allow me to say good-bye to those who are at my house.” 
\p
\v 62 But Yeshua said to him, \wj “\+w No\+w* \+w one\+w*, \+w having\+w* \+w put\+w* \+w his\+w* \+w hand\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w the\+w* plough \+w and\+w* \+w looking\+w* \+w back\+w*, \+w is\+w* \+w fit\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w God\+w*’s Kingdom.”\wj*

\v 34 They understood none of these things. This saying was hidden from them, and they didn’t understand the things that were said.

\v 35 As he came near Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the road, begging. 
\v 36 Hearing a multitude going by, he asked what this meant. 
\v 37 They told him that Yeshua of Nazareth was passing by. 
\v 38 He cried out, “Yeshua, you son of David, have mercy on me!” 
\v 39 Those who led the way rebuked him, that he should be quiet; but he cried out all the more, “You son of David, have mercy on me!” 
\p
\v 40 Standing still, Yeshua commanded him to be brought to him. When he had come near, he asked him, 
\v 41  \wj “\+w What\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w want\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w do\+w*?”\wj*

\v 42 Yeshua said to him, \wj “\+w Receive\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w sight\+w*. \+w Your\+w* \+w faith\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w healed\+w* \+w you\+w*.” \wj* 
\p
\v 43 Immediately he received his sight and followed him, glorifying God. All the people, when they saw it, praised God.

\v 1 He entered and was passing through Jericho. 
\v 2 There was a man named Zacchaeus. He was a chief tax collector, and he was rich. 
\v 3 He was trying to see who Yeshua was, and couldn’t because of the crowd, because he was short. 
\v 4 He ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was going to pass that way. 
\v 5 When Yeshua came to the place, he looked up and saw him, and said to him, \wj “\+w Zacchaeus\+w*, \+w hurry\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w come\+w* \+w down\+w*, \+w for\+w* \+w today\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w must\+w* \+w stay\+w* \+w at\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w house\+w*.” \wj* 
\v 6 He hurried, came down, and received him joyfully. 
\v 7 When they saw it, they all murmured, saying, “He has gone in to lodge with a man who is a sinner.” 
\p
\v 8 Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, “Behold, Lord, half of my goods I give to the poor. If I have wrongfully exacted anything of anyone, I restore four times as much.”

\v 19 The chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on him that very hour, but they feared the people—for they knew he had spoken this parable against them.

\v 26 They weren’t able to trap him in his words before the people. They marvelled at his answer and were silent. 
\v 27 Some of the Sadducees came to him, those who deny that there is a resurrection. 
\v 28 They asked him, “Rabbi, Moses wrote to us that if a man’s brother dies having a wife, and he is childless, his brother should take the wife and raise up children for his brother. 
\v 29 There were therefore seven brothers. The first took a wife, and died childless. 
\v 30 The second took her as wife, and he died childless. 
\v 31 The third took her, and likewise the seven all left no children, and died. 
\v 32 Afterward the woman also died.

\p
\v 13 They went, found things as Yeshua had told them, and they prepared the Passover. 
\p
\v 14 When the hour had come, he sat down with the twelve emissaries. 
\v 15 He said to them, \wj “\+w I\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w earnestly\+w* \+w desired\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w eat\+w* \+w this\+w* \+w Passover\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w before\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w suffer\+w*, \wj*

\v 17 He received a cup, and when he had given thanks, he said, \wj “\+w Take\+w* \+w this\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w share\+w* \+w it\+w* amongst \+w yourselves\+w*, \wj*

\v 19 He took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke and gave it to them, saying, \wj “\+w This\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w body\+w* \+w which\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w given\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w you\+w*. \+w Do\+w* \+w this\+w* \+w in\+w* memory \+w of\+w* \+w me\+w*.”\wj* 
\v 20 Likewise, he took the cup after supper, saying, \wj “\+w This\+w* \+w cup\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w new\+w* \+w covenant\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w my\+w* blood, \+w which\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w poured\+w* \+w out\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w you\+w*. \wj*

\p
\v 23 They began to question amongst themselves which of them it was who would do this thing.

\v 24 A dispute also arose amongst them, which of them was considered to be greatest.

\p
\v 33 He said to him, “Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death!” 
\p
\v 34 He said, \wj “\+w I\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w*, \+w Peter\+w*, \+w the\+w* rooster \+w will\+w* \+w by\+w* \+w no\+w* \+w means\+w* \+w crow\+w* \+w today\+w* \+w until\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w deny\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w know\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w three\+w* \+w times\+w*.”\wj*

\v 38 They said, “Lord, behold, here are two swords.”

\p
\v 39 He came out and went, as his custom was, to the Mount of Olives. His disciples also followed him. 
\v 40 When he was at the place, he said to them, \wj “\+w Pray\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w you\+w* don’\+w t\+w* \+w enter\+w* \+w into\+w* \+w temptation\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 41 He was withdrawn from them about a stone’s throw, and he knelt down and prayed, 
\v 42 saying, \wj “\+w Father\+w*, \+w if\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w willing\+w*, \+w remove\+w* \+w this\+w* \+w cup\+w* \+w from\+w* \+w me\+w*. \+w Nevertheless\+w*, \+w not\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w will\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w yours\+w*, \+w be\+w* \+w done\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 43 An angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him. 
\v 44 Being in agony, he prayed more earnestly. His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground. 
\p
\v 45 When he rose up from his prayer, he came to the disciples and found them sleeping because of grief, 
\v 46 and said to them, \wj “\+w Why\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w sleep\+w*? Rise \+w and\+w* \+w pray\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w may\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w enter\+w* \+w into\+w* \+w temptation\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 47 While he was still speaking, a crowd appeared. He who was called Judah, one of the twelve, was leading them. He came near to Yeshua to kiss him. 
\v 48 But Yeshua said to him, \wj “\+w Judah\+w*, \+w do\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w betray\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Son\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Man\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w kiss\+w*?”\wj* 
\p
\v 49 When those who were around him saw what was about to happen, they said to him, “Lord, shall we strike with the sword?” 
\v 50 A certain one of them struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear. 
\p
\v 51 But Yeshua answered, \wj “\+w Let\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w at\+w* least \+w do\+w* \+w this\+w*”\wj*—and he touched his ear and healed him. 
\v 52 Yeshua said to the chief priests, captains of the temple, and elders, who had come against him, \wj “\+w Have\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w come\+w* \+w out\+w* \+w as\+w* \+w against\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w robber\+w*, \+w with\+w* \+w swords\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w clubs\+w*? \wj*

\p
\v 54 They seized him and led him away, and brought him into the high priest’s house. But Peter followed from a distance. 
\v 55 When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter sat amongst them. 
\v 56 A certain servant girl saw him as he sat in the light, and looking intently at him, said, “This man also was with him.” 
\p
\v 57 He denied Yeshua, saying, “Woman, I don’t know him.” 
\p
\v 58 After a little while someone else saw him and said, “You also are one of them!” 
\p But Peter answered, “Man, I am not!” 
\p
\v 59 After about one hour passed, another confidently affirmed, saying, “Truly this man also was with him, for he is a Galilean!” 
\p
\v 60 But Peter said, “Man, I don’t know what you are talking about!” Immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed. 
\v 61 The Lord turned and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered the Lord’s word, how he said to him, \wj “\+w Before\+w* \+w the\+w* rooster \+w crows\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w deny\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w three\+w* \+w times\+w*.”\wj* 
\v 62 He went out, and wept bitterly. 
\p
\v 63 The men who held Yeshua mocked him and beat him. 
\v 64 Having blindfolded him, they struck him on the face and asked him, “Prophesy! Who is the one who struck you?” 
\v 65 They spoke many other things against him, insulting him. 
\p
\v 66 As soon as it was day, the assembly of the elders of the people were gathered together, both chief priests and scribes, and they led him away into their council, saying, 
\v 67 “If you are the Messiah, tell us.” 
\p But he said to them, \wj “\+w If\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w*, \+w you\+w* won’t \+w believe\+w*, \wj* 
\v 68  \wj \+w and\+w* \+w if\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w ask\+w*, \+w you\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w no\+w* way answer \+w me\+w* \+w or\+w* \+w let\+w* \+w me\+w* go. \wj*

\p
\v 70 They all said, “Are you then the Son of God?” 
\p He said to them, \wj “\+w You\+w* \+w say\+w* \+w it\+w*, \+w because\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w am\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 71 They said, “Why do we need any more witness? For we ourselves have heard from his own mouth!” 
\c 23  
\p
\v 1 The whole company of them rose up and brought him before Pilate. 
\v 2 They began to accuse him, saying, “We found this man perverting the nation, forbidding paying taxes to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Messiah, a king.” 
\p
\v 3 Pilate asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” 
\p He answered him, \wj “\+w So\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w say\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 4 Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, “I find no basis for a charge against this man.” 
\p
\v 5 But they insisted, saying, “He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee even to this place.” 
\p
\v 6 But when Pilate heard Galilee mentioned, he asked if the man was a Galilean. 
\v 7 When he found out that he was in Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem during those days. 
\p
\v 8 Now when Herod saw Yeshua, he was exceedingly glad, for he had wanted to see him for a long time, because he had heard many things about him. He hoped to see some miracle done by him. 
\v 9 He questioned him with many words, but he gave no answers. 
\v 10 The chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him. 
\v 11 Herod with his soldiers humiliated him and mocked him. Dressing him in luxurious clothing, they sent him back to Pilate. 
\v 12 Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before that they were enemies with each other. 
\p
\v 13 Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people, 
\v 14 and said to them, “You brought this man to me as one that perverts the people, and behold, having examined him before you, I found no basis for a charge against this man concerning those things of which you accuse him. 
\v 15 Neither has Herod, for I sent you to him, and see, nothing worthy of death has been done by him. 
\v 16 I will therefore chastise him and release him.” 
\p
\v 17 Now he had to release one prisoner to them at the feast.\f + \fr 23:17  \ft NU omits verse 17.\f* 
\v 18 But they all cried out together, saying, “Away with this man! Release to us Barabbas!”— 
\v 19 one who was thrown into prison for a certain revolt in the city, and for murder. 
\p
\v 20 Then Pilate spoke to them again, wanting to release Yeshua, 
\v 21 but they shouted, saying, “Crucify! Crucify him!” 
\p
\v 22 He said to them the third time, “Why? What evil has this man done? I have found no capital crime in him. I will therefore chastise him and release him.” 
\v 23 But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. Their voices and the voices of the chief priests prevailed. 
\v 24 Pilate decreed that what they asked for should be done. 
\v 25 He released him who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but he delivered Yeshua up to their will. 
\p
\v 26 When they led him away, they grabbed one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid the cross on him to carry it after Yeshua. 
\v 27 A great multitude of the people followed him, including women who also mourned and lamented him. 
\v 28 But Yeshua, turning to them, said, \wj “\+w Daughters\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Jerusalem\+w*, don’\+w t\+w* \+w weep\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w me\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w weep\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w yourselves\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w children\+w*. \wj*

\p
\v 32 There were also others, two criminals, led with him to be put to death. 
\v 33 When they came to the place that is called “The Skull”, they crucified him there with the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left. 
\p
\v 34 Yeshua said, \wj “\+w Father\+w*, forgive \+w them\+w*, \+w for\+w* \+w they\+w* don’\+w t\+w* \+w know\+w* \+w what\+w* \+w they\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w doing\+w*.”\wj* 
\p Dividing his garments amongst them, they cast lots. 
\v 35 The people stood watching. The rulers with them also scoffed at him, saying, “He saved others. Let him save himself, if this is the Messiah of God, his chosen one!” 
\p
\v 36 The soldiers also mocked him, coming to him and offering him vinegar, 
\v 37 and saying, “If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!” 
\p
\v 38 An inscription was also written over him in letters of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew: “THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.” 
\p
\v 39 One of the criminals who was hanged insulted him, saying, “If you are the Messiah, save yourself and us!” 
\p
\v 40 But the other answered, and rebuking him said, “Don’t you even fear God, seeing you are under the same condemnation? 
\v 41 And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong.” 
\v 42 He said to Yeshua, “Lord, remember me when you come into your Kingdom.” 
\p
\v 43 Yeshua said to him, \wj “Assuredly \+w I\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w*, \+w today\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w Paradise\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 44 It was now about the sixth hour,\f + \fr 23:44  \ft Time was counted from sunrise, so the sixth hour was about noon.\f* and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.\f + \fr 23:44  \ft 3:00 p.m.\f* 
\v 45 The sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in two. 
\v 46 Yeshua, crying with a loud voice, said, \wj “\+w Father\+w*, \+w into\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w hands\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w commit\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w spirit\+w*!”\wj* Having said this, he breathed his last. 
\p
\v 47 When the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, “Certainly this was a righteous man.” 
\v 48 All the multitudes that came together to see this, when they saw the things that were done, returned home beating their chests. 
\v 49 All his acquaintances and the women who followed with him from Galilee stood at a distance, watching these things. 
\p
\v 50 Behold, there was a man named Joseph, who was a member of the council, a good and righteous man 
\v 51 (he had not consented to their counsel and deed), from Arimathaea, a city of the Judeans, who was also waiting for God’s Kingdom. 
\v 52 This man went to Pilate, and asked for Yeshua’s body. 
\v 53 He took it down and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone, where no one had ever been laid. 
\v 54 It was the day of the Preparation, and the Sabbath was drawing near. 
\v 55 The women who had come with him out of Galilee followed after, and saw the tomb and how his body was laid. 
\v 56 They returned and prepared spices and ointments. On the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment. 
\c 24  
\p
\v 1 But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they and some others came to the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared. 
\v 2 They found the stone rolled away from the tomb. 
\v 3 They entered in, and didn’t find the Lord Yeshua’s body. 
\v 4 While they were greatly perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling clothing. 
\v 5 Becoming terrified, they bowed their faces down to the earth. 
\p The men said to them, “Why do you seek the living amongst the dead? 
\v 6 He isn’t here, but is risen. Remember what he told you when he was still in Galilee, 
\v 7 saying that the Son of Man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men and be crucified, and the third day rise again?” 
\p
\v 8 They remembered his words, 
\v 9 returned from the tomb, and told all these things to the Eleven and to all the rest. 
\v 10 Now they were Miriam Magdalene, Yochanah, and Miriam the mother of Jacob. The other women with them told these things to the emissaries. 
\v 11 These words seemed to them to be nonsense, and they didn’t believe them. 
\v 12 But Peter got up and ran to the tomb. Stooping and looking in, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he departed to his home, wondering what had happened. 
\p
\v 13 Behold, two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was sixty stadia\f + \fr 24:13  \ft 60 stadia = about 11 kilometres or about 7 miles. \f* from Jerusalem. 
\v 14 They talked with each other about all of these things which had happened. 
\v 15 While they talked and questioned together, Yeshua himself came near, and went with them. 
\v 16 But their eyes were kept from recognising him. 
\v 17 He said to them, \wj “\+w What\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w talking\+w* \+w about\+w* \+w as\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w walk\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w sad\+w*?”\wj* 
\p
\v 18 One of them, named Klofah, answered him, “Are you the only stranger in Jerusalem who doesn’t know the things which have happened there in these days?” 
\p
\v 19 He said to them, \wj “\+w What\+w* \+w things\+w*?”\wj* 
\p They said to him, “The things concerning Yeshua the Nazarene, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people; 
\v 20 and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him. 
\v 21 But we were hoping that it was he who would redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened. 
\v 22 Also, certain women of our company amazed us, having arrived early at the tomb; 
\v 23 and when they didn’t find his body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive. 
\v 24 Some of us went to the tomb and found it just like the women had said, but they didn’t see him.” 
\p
\v 25 He said to them, \wj “\+w Foolish\+w* \+w people\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w slow\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w heart\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w believe\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w all\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w prophets\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w spoken\+w*! \wj* 
\v 26  \wj Didn’\+w t\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Messiah\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w suffer\+w* \+w these\+w* \+w things\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w enter\+w* \+w into\+w* \+w his\+w* \+w glory\+w*?”\wj* 
\v 27 Beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, he explained to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself. 
\p
\v 28 They came near to the village where they were going, and he acted like he would go further. 
\p
\v 29 They urged him, saying, “Stay with us, for it is almost evening, and the day is almost over.” 
\p He went in to stay with them. 
\v 30 When he had sat down at the table with them, he took the bread and gave thanks. Breaking it, he gave it to them. 
\v 31 Their eyes were opened and they recognised him; then he vanished out of their sight. 
\v 32 They said to one another, “Weren’t our hearts burning within us while he spoke to us along the way, and while he opened the Scriptures to us?” 
\v 33 They rose up that very hour, returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and those who were with them, 
\v 34 saying, “The Lord is risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!” 
\v 35 They related the things that happened along the way, and how he was recognised by them in the breaking of the bread. 
\p
\v 36 As they said these things, Yeshua himself stood amongst them, and said to them, \wj “Peace \+w be\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w you\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 37 But they were terrified and filled with fear, and supposed that they had seen a spirit. 
\p
\v 38 He said to them, \wj “\+w Why\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w troubled\+w*? \+w Why\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w doubts\+w* arise \+w in\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w hearts\+w*? \wj* 
\v 39  \wj \+w See\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w hands\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w feet\+w*, \+w that\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w is\+w* truly \+w me\+w*. \+w Touch\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w see\+w*, \+w for\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w spirit\+w* doesn’\+w t\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w flesh\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w bones\+w*, \+w as\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w see\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w have\+w*.”\wj* 
\v 40 When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet. 
\v 41 While they still didn’t believe for joy, and wondered, he said to them, \wj “\+w Do\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w anything\+w* \+w here\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w eat\+w*?”\wj* 
\p
\v 42 They gave him a piece of a broiled fish and some honeycomb. 
\v 43 He took them, and ate in front of them. 
\v 44 He said to them, \wj “\+w This\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w what\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w told\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w while\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w was\+w* \+w still\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w you\+w*, \+w that\+w* \+w all\+w* \+w things\+w* \+w which\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w written\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w the\+w* Torah \+w of\+w* \+w Moses\+w*, \+w the\+w* \+w Prophets\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Psalms\+w* \+w concerning\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w must\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w fulfilled\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 45 Then he opened their minds, that they might understand the Scriptures. 
\v 46 He said to them, \wj “\+w Thus\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w written\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w thus\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w was\+w* necessary \+w for\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Messiah\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w suffer\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w rise\+w* \+w from\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w dead\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w third\+w* \+w day\+w*, \wj* 
\v 47  \wj \+w and\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w repentance\+w* \+w and\+w* remission \+w of\+w* sins \+w should\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w preached\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w his\+w* \+w name\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w all\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w nations\+w*, beginning \+w at\+w* \+w Jerusalem\+w*. \wj* 
\v 48  \wj \+w You\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w witnesses\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w these\+w* \+w things\+w*. \wj* 
\v 49  \wj \+w Behold\+w*, \+w I\+w* \+w send\+w* \+w out\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w promise\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w Father\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w you\+w*. \+w But\+w* wait \+w in\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w city\+w* \+w of\+w* Jerusalem \+w until\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w clothed\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w power\+w* \+w from\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w high\+w*.” \wj* 
\p
\v 50 He led them out as far as Bethany, and he lifted up his hands and blessed them. 
\v 51 While he blessed them, he withdrew from them and was carried up into heaven. 
\v 52 They worshipped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy, 
\v 53 and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.
