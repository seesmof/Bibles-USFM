\v 1 A record of the genealogy of Yeshua the Messiah,\f + \fr 1:1  \ft Messiah (Hebrew) and Christ (Greek) both mean “Anointed One”\f* the son of David, the son of Abraham. 
\p
\v 2 Abraham became the father of Isaac. Isaac became the father of Jacob. Jacob became the father of Judah and his brothers. 
\v 3 Judah became the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar. Perez became the father of Hezron. Hezron became the father of Ram. 
\v 4 Ram became the father of Amminadab. Amminadab became the father of Nahshon. Nahshon became the father of Salmon. 
\v 5 Salmon became the father of Boaz by Rahab. Boaz became the father of Obed by Ruth. Obed became the father of Jesse. 
\v 6 Jesse became the father of King David. David the king\f + \fr 1:6  \ft NU omits “the king”.\f* became the father of Solomon by her who had been Uriah’s wife. 
\v 7 Solomon became the father of Rehoboam. Rehoboam became the father of Abijah. Abijah became the father of Asa. 
\v 8 Asa became the father of Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat became the father of Joram. Joram became the father of Uzziah. 
\v 9 Uzziah became the father of Jotham. Jotham became the father of Ahaz. Ahaz became the father of Hezekiah. 
\v 10 Hezekiah became the father of Manasseh. Manasseh became the father of Amon. Amon became the father of Josiah. 
\v 11 Josiah became the father of Jechoniah and his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon. 
\p
\v 12 After the exile to Babylon, Jechoniah became the father of Shealtiel. Shealtiel became the father of Zerubbabel. 
\v 13 Zerubbabel became the father of Abiud. Abiud became the father of Eliakim. Eliakim became the father of Azor. 
\v 14 Azor became the father of Zadok. Zadok became the father of Achim. Achim became the father of Eliud. 
\v 15 Eliud became the father of Eleazar. Eleazar became the father of Matthan. Matthan became the father of Jacob. 
\v 16 Jacob became the father of Joseph, the husband of Miriam, from whom was born Yeshua,\f + \fr 1:16  \ft “Yeshua” means “Salvation”.\f* who is called Messiah. 
\p
\v 17 So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; from David to the exile to Babylon fourteen generations; and from the carrying away to Babylon to the Messiah, fourteen generations. 
\p
\v 18 Now the birth of Yeshua the Messiah was like this: After his mother, Miriam, was engaged to Joseph, before they came together, she was found pregnant by the Holy Spirit. 
\v 19 Joseph, her husband, being a righteous man, and not willing to make her a public example, intended to put her away secretly. 
\v 20 But when he thought about these things, behold,\f + \fr 1:20  \ft “Behold”, from “ἰδοὺ”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.\f* an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, don’t be afraid to take to yourself Miriam as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit. 
\v 21 She shall give birth to a son. You shall name him Yeshua,\f + \fr 1:21  \ft “Yeshua” means “Salvation”.\f* for it is he who shall save his people from their sins.” 
\p
\v 22 Now all this has happened that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, 
\q1
\v 23 “Behold, the virgin shall be with child, 
\q2 and shall give birth to a son. 
\q1 They shall call his name Immanuel,” 
\q2 which is, being interpreted, “God with us.”\x + \xo 1:23  \xt Isaiah 7:14\x* 
\p
\v 24 Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took his wife to himself; 
\v 25 and didn’t know her sexually until she had given birth to her firstborn son. He named him Yeshua. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 Now when Yeshua was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of King Herod, behold, wise men\f + \fr 2:1  \ft The word for “wise men” (magoi) can also mean teachers, scientists, physicians, astrologers, seers, interpreters of dreams, or sorcerers.\f* from the east came to Jerusalem, saying, 
\v 2 “Where is he who is born King of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east, and have come to worship him.” 
\v 3 When King Herod heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. 
\v 4 Gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he asked them where the Messiah would be born. 
\v 5 They said to him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for this is written through the prophet, 
\q1
\v 6 ‘You Bethlehem, land of Judah, 
\q2 are in no way least amongst the princes of Judah; 
\q1 for out of you shall come a governor 
\q2 who shall shepherd my people, Israel.’”\x + \xo 2:6  \xt Micah 5:2\x* 
\p
\v 7 Then Herod secretly called the wise men, and learnt from them exactly what time the star appeared. 
\v 8 He sent them to Bethlehem, and said, “Go and search diligently for the young child. When you have found him, bring me word, so that I also may come and worship him.” 
\p
\v 9 They, having heard the king, went their way; and behold, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them until it came and stood over where the young child was. 
\v 10 When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy. 
\v 11 They came into the house and saw the young child with Miriam, his mother, and they fell down and worshipped him. Opening their treasures, they offered to him gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh. 
\v 12 Being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they went back to their own country another way. 
\p
\v 13 Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, “Arise and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.” 
\p
\v 14 He arose and took the young child and his mother by night and departed into Egypt, 
\v 15 and was there until the death of Herod, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, “Out of Egypt I called my son.”\x + \xo 2:15  \xt Hosea 11:1\x* 
\p
\v 16 Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked by the wise men, was exceedingly angry, and sent out and killed all the male children who were in Bethlehem and in all the surrounding countryside, from two years old and under, according to the exact time which he had learnt from the wise men. 
\v 17 Then that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying, 
\q1
\v 18 “A voice was heard in Ramah, 
\q2 lamentation, weeping and great mourning, 
\q1 Rachel weeping for her children; 
\q2 she wouldn’t be comforted, 
\q2 because they are no more.”\x + \xo 2:18  \xt Jeremiah 31:15\x* 
\p
\v 19 But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying, 
\v 20 “Arise and take the young child and his mother, and go into Eretz-Israel, for those who sought the young child’s life are dead.” 
\p
\v 21 He arose and took the young child and his mother, and came into Eretz-Israel. 
\v 22 But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in the place of his father, Herod, he was afraid to go there. Being warned in a dream, he withdrew into the region of Galilee, 
\v 23 and came and lived in a city called Nazareth; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets that he will be called a Nazarene. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 In those days, Yochanan the Immerser came, proclaiming in the wilderness of Judea, saying, 
\v 2 “Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!” 
\v 3 For this is he who was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet, saying, 
\q1 “The voice of one crying in the wilderness, 
\q2 make the way of the Lord ready! 
\q2 Make his paths straight!”\x + \xo 3:3  \xt Isaiah 40:3\x* 
\p
\v 4 Now Yochanan himself wore clothing made of camel’s hair with a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey. 
\v 5 Then people from Jerusalem, all of Judea, and all the region around the Jordan went out to him. 
\v 6 They were immersed by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins. 
\p
\v 7 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for his immersion, he said to them, “You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? 
\v 8 Therefore produce fruit worthy of repentance! 
\v 9 Don’t think to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham for our father,’ for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones. 
\v 10 Even now the axe lies at the root of the trees. Therefore every tree that doesn’t produce good fruit is cut down, and cast into the fire. 
\p
\v 11 “I indeed immerse you in water for repentance, but he who comes after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will immerse you in the Holy Spirit.\f + \fr 3:11  \ft TR and NU add “and with fire” \f* 
\v 12 His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor. He will gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire.” 
\p
\v 13 Then Yeshua came from Galilee to the Jordan\f + \fr 3:13  \ft i.e., the Jordan River\f* to Yochanan, to be immersed by him. 
\v 14 But Yochanan would have hindered him, saying, “I need to be immersed by you, and you come to me?” 
\p
\v 15 But Yeshua, answering, said to him, \wj “Allow \+w it\+w* \+w now\+w*, \+w for\+w* \+w this\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w fitting\+w* \+w way\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w us\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w fulfil\+w* \+w all\+w* \+w righteousness\+w*.”\wj* Then he allowed him. 
\p
\v 16 Yeshua, when he was immersed, went up directly from the water: and behold, the heavens were opened to him. He saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming on him. 
\v 17 Behold, a voice out of the heavens said, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.” 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 Then Yeshua was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. 
\v 2 When he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was hungry afterward. 
\v 3 The tempter came and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread.” 
\p
\v 4 But he answered, \wj “\+w It\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w written\+w*, ‘\+w Man\+w* \+w shall\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w live\+w* \+w by\+w* bread \+w alone\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w by\+w* \+w every\+w* \+w word\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w proceeds\+w* \+w out\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w God\+w*’s \+w mouth\+w*.’”\wj*\x + \xo 4:4  \xt Deuteronomy 8:3\x* 
\p
\v 5 Then the devil took him into the holy city. He set him on the pinnacle of the temple, 
\v 6 and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, 
\q1 ‘He will command his angels concerning you,’ and, 
\q1 ‘On their hands they will bear you up, 
\q2 so that you don’t dash your foot against a stone.’”\x + \xo 4:6  \xt Psalms 91:11-12 \x* 
\p
\v 7 Yeshua said to him, \wj “\+w Again\+w*, \+w it\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w written\+w*, ‘\+w You\+w* \+w shall\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w test\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Lord\+w*, \+w your\+w* \+w God\+w*.’”\wj*\x + \xo 4:7  \xt Deuteronomy 6:16\x* 
\p
\v 8 Again, the devil took him to an exceedingly high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. 
\v 9 He said to him, “I will give you all of these things, if you will fall down and worship me.” 
\p
\v 10 Then Yeshua said to him, \wj “\+w Get\+w* behind \+w me\+w*,\wj*\f + \fr 4:10  \ft TR and NU read “Go away” instead of “Get behind me”\f* \wj \+w Satan\+w*! \+w For\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w written\+w*, ‘\+w You\+w* \+w shall\+w* \+w worship\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Lord\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w God\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w shall\+w* \+w serve\+w* \+w him\+w* \+w only\+w*.’”\wj* \x + \xo 4:10  \xt Deuteronomy 6:13\x* 
\p
\v 11 Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and served him. 
\p
\v 12 Now when Yeshua heard that Yochanan was delivered up, he withdrew into Galilee. 
\v 13 Leaving Nazareth, he came and lived in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali, 
\v 14 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying, 
\q1
\v 15 “The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, 
\q2 towards the sea, beyond the Jordan, 
\q2 Galilee of the Gentiles, 
\q1
\v 16 the people who sat in darkness saw a great light; 
\q2 to those who sat in the region and shadow of death, 
\q2 to them light has dawned.”\x + \xo 4:16  \xt Isaiah 9:1-2\x* 
\p
\v 17 From that time, Yeshua began to proclaim, and to say, \wj “\+w Repent\+w*! \+w For\+w* \+w the\+w* Kingdom \+w of\+w* \+w Heaven\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w at\+w* \+w hand\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 18 Walking by the sea of Galilee, he\f + \fr 4:18  \ft TR reads “Yeshua” instead of “he” \f* saw two brothers: Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew, his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen. 
\v 19 He said to them, \wj “\+w Come\+w* \+w after\+w* \+w me\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w make\+w* \+w you\+w* fishers \+w for\+w* men.”\wj* 
\p
\v 20 They immediately left their nets and followed him. 
\v 21 Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, Jacob the son of Zebedee, and Yochanan his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. He called them. 
\v 22 They immediately left the boat and their father, and followed him. 
\p
\v 23 Yeshua went about in all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the Good News of the Kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness amongst the people. 
\v 24 The report about him went out into all Syria. They brought to him all who were sick, afflicted with various diseases and torments, possessed with demons, epileptics, and paralytics; and he healed them. 
\v 25 Great multitudes from Galilee, Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and from beyond the Jordan followed him. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 Seeing the multitudes, he went up onto the mountain. When he had sat down, his disciples came to him. 
\v 2 He opened his mouth and taught them, saying,

\v 1 When he came down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.

\v 5 When he came into Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking him for help,

\v 14 When Yeshua came into Peter’s house, he saw his wife’s mother lying sick with a fever. 
\v 15 He touched her hand, and the fever left her. So she got up and served him.\f + \fr 8:15  \ft TR reads “them” instead of “him”\f* 
\v 16 When evening came, they brought to him many possessed with demons. He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick,

\p
\v 18 Now when Yeshua saw great multitudes around him, he gave the order to depart to the other side. 
\p
\v 19 A scribe came and said to him, “Rabbi, I will follow you wherever you go.” 
\p
\v 20 Yeshua said to him, \wj “\+w The\+w* foxes \+w have\+w* \+w holes\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w birds\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w sky\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w nests\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Son\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Man\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w nowhere\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w lay\+w* \+w his\+w* \+w head\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 21 Another of his disciples said to him, “Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.” 
\p
\v 22 But Yeshua said to him, \wj “\+w Follow\+w* \+w me\+w*, \+w and\+w* leave \+w the\+w* \+w dead\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w bury\+w* \+w their\+w* \+w own\+w* \+w dead\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 23 When he got into a boat, his disciples followed him. 
\v 24 Behold, a violent storm came up on the sea, so much that the boat was covered with the waves; but he was asleep. 
\v 25 The disciples came to him and woke him up, saying, “Save us, Lord! We are dying!” 
\p
\v 26 He said to them, \wj “\+w Why\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w fearful\+w*, O \+w you\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w little\+w* \+w faith\+w*?” \wj* Then he got up, rebuked the wind and the sea, and there was a great calm. 
\p
\v 27 The men marvelled, saying, “What kind of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?” 
\p
\v 28 When he came to the other side, into the country of the Gergesenes,\f + \fr 8:28  \ft NU reads “Gadarenes”\f* two people possessed by demons met him there, coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that nobody could pass that way. 
\v 29 Behold, they cried out, saying, “What do we have to do with you, Yeshua, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?” 
\v 30 Now there was a herd of many pigs feeding far away from them. 
\v 31 The demons begged him, saying, “If you cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of pigs.” 
\p
\v 32 He said to them, \wj “\+w Go\+w*!”\wj* 
\p They came out and went into the herd of pigs; and behold, the whole herd of pigs rushed down the cliff into the sea and died in the water. 
\v 33 Those who fed them fled and went away into the city and told everything, including what happened to those who were possessed with demons. 
\v 34 Behold, all the city came out to meet Yeshua. When they saw him, they begged that he would depart from their borders. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 He entered into a boat and crossed over, and came into his own city. 
\v 2 Behold, they brought to him a man who was paralysed, lying on a bed. Yeshua, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, \wj “\+w Son\+w*, cheer \+w up\+w*! \+w Your\+w* sins \+w are\+w* forgiven \+w you\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 3 Behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, “This man blasphemes.”

\v 4 Yeshua, knowing their thoughts, said, \wj “\+w Why\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w think\+w* \+w evil\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w hearts\+w*? \wj*

\p
\v 7 He arose and departed to his house. 
\v 8 But when the multitudes saw it, they marvelled and glorified God, who had given such authority to men. 
\p
\v 9 As Yeshua passed by from there, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax collection office. He said to him, \wj “Follow \+w me\+w*.”\wj* He got up and followed him. 
\v 10 As he sat in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with Yeshua and his disciples. 
\v 11 When the Pharisees saw it, they said to his disciples, “Why does your rabbi eat with tax collectors and sinners?” 
\p
\v 12 When Yeshua heard it, he said to them, \wj “\+w Those\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w healthy\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w no\+w* \+w need\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w physician\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w those\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w sick\+w* \+w do\+w*. \wj*

\v 14 Then Yochanan’s disciples came to him, saying, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples don’t fast?”

\v 15 Yeshua said to them, \wj “\+w Can\+w* \+w the\+w* friends \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w bridegroom\+w* \+w mourn\+w* \+w as\+w* \+w long\+w* \+w as\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w bridegroom\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w them\+w*? \+w But\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w days\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w come\+w* \+w when\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w bridegroom\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w be\+w* taken \+w away\+w* \+w from\+w* \+w them\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w then\+w* \+w they\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w fast\+w*. \wj*

\p
\v 18 While he told these things to them, behold, a ruler came and worshipped him, saying, “My daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live.” 
\p
\v 19 Yeshua got up and followed him, as did his disciples. 
\v 20 Behold, a woman who had a discharge of blood for twelve years came behind him, and touched the fringe\f + \fr 9:20  \ft or, tassel\f* of his garment; 
\v 21 for she said within herself, “If I just touch his garment, I will be made well.”

\v 22 But Yeshua, turning around and seeing her, said, \wj “\+w Daughter\+w*, cheer \+w up\+w*! \+w Your\+w* \+w faith\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w made\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w well\+w*.”\wj* And the woman was made well from that hour. 
\p
\v 23 When Yeshua came into the ruler’s house and saw the flute players and the crowd in noisy disorder, 
\v 24 he said to them, \wj “\+w Make\+w* room, \+w because\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w girl\+w* isn’\+w t\+w* dead, \+w but\+w* \+w sleeping\+w*.”\wj* 
\p They were ridiculing him. 
\v 25 But when the crowd was sent out, he entered in, took her by the hand, and the girl arose. 
\v 26 The report of this went out into all that land. 
\p
\v 27 As Yeshua passed by from there, two blind men followed him, calling out and saying, “Have mercy on us, son of David!” 
\v 28 When he had come into the house, the blind men came to him. Yeshua said to them, \wj “\+w Do\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w believe\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w am\+w* \+w able\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w this\+w*?”\wj* 
\p They told him, “Yes, Lord.” 
\p
\v 29 Then he touched their eyes, saying, \wj “\+w According\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w faith\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w done\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w you\+w*.”\wj* 
\v 30 Then their eyes were opened. Yeshua strictly commanded them, saying, \wj “\+w See\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w no\+w* \+w one\+w* \+w knows\+w* \+w about\+w* \+w this\+w*.”\wj* 
\v 31 But they went out and spread abroad his fame in all that land.

\v 32 As they went out, behold, a mute man who was demon possessed was brought to him. 
\v 33 When the demon was cast out, the mute man spoke. The multitudes marvelled, saying, “Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel!” 
\p
\v 34 But the Pharisees said, “By the prince of the demons, he casts out demons.” 
\p
\v 35 Yeshua went about all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the Good News of the Kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness amongst the people. 
\v 36 But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion for them because they were harassed\f + \fr 9:36  \ft TR reads “weary” instead of “harassed” \f* and scattered, like sheep without a shepherd. 
\v 37 Then he said to his disciples, \wj “\+w The\+w* \+w harvest\+w* \+w indeed\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w plentiful\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w labourers\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w few\+w*. \wj*

\v 53 When Yeshua had finished these parables, he departed from there.

\v 1 At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard the report concerning Yeshua, 
\v 2 and said to his servants, “This is Yochanan the Immerser. He is risen from the dead. That is why these powers work in him.” 
\v 3 For Herod had arrested Yochanan, bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife. 
\v 4 For Yochanan said to him, “It is not lawful for you to have her.” 
\v 5 When he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet. 
\v 6 But when Herod’s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced amongst them and pleased Herod. 
\v 7 Therefore he promised with an oath to give her whatever she should ask. 
\v 8 She, being prompted by her mother, said, “Give me here on a platter the head of Yochanan the Immerser.” 
\p
\v 9 The king was grieved, but for the sake of his oaths and of those who sat at the table with him, he commanded it to be given, 
\v 10 and he sent and beheaded Yochanan in the prison. 
\v 11 His head was brought on a platter and given to the young lady; and she brought it to her mother. 
\v 12 His disciples came, took the body, and buried it. Then they went and told Yeshua. 
\v 13 Now when Yeshua heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat to a deserted place apart. When the multitudes heard it, they followed him on foot from the cities. 
\p
\v 14 Yeshua went out, and he saw a great multitude. He had compassion on them and healed their sick. 
\v 15 When evening had come, his disciples came to him, saying, “This place is deserted, and the hour is already late. Send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves food.” 
\p
\v 16 But Yeshua said to them, \wj “\+w They\+w* don’\+w t\+w* \+w need\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w go\+w* away. \+w You\+w* \+w give\+w* \+w them\+w* something \+w to\+w* \+w eat\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 17 They told him, “We only have here five loaves and two fish.” 
\p
\v 18 He said, \wj “\+w Bring\+w* \+w them\+w* \+w here\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w me\+w*.”\wj* 
\v 19 He commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass; and he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, broke and gave the loaves to the disciples; and the disciples gave to the multitudes. 
\v 20 They all ate and were filled. They took up twelve baskets full of that which remained left over from the broken pieces. 
\v 21 Those who ate were about five thousand men, in addition to women and children. 
\p
\v 22 Immediately Yeshua made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side, while he sent the multitudes away. 
\v 23 After he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into the mountain by himself to pray. When evening had come, he was there alone. 
\v 24 But the boat was now in the middle of the sea, distressed by the waves, for the wind was contrary. 
\v 25 In the fourth watch of the night,\f + \fr 14:25  \ft The night was equally divided into four watches, so the fourth watch is approximately 3:00 a.m. to sunrise. \f* Yeshua came to them, walking on the sea.\x + \xo 14:25  \xt See Job 9:8\x* 
\v 26 When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, “It’s a ghost!” and they cried out for fear. 
\v 27 But immediately Yeshua spoke to them, saying, \wj “Cheer \+w up\+w*! \+w It\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w I\+w*! \wj*\f + \fr 14:27  \ft or, I AM!\f* \wj Don’t \+w be\+w* \+w afraid\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 28 Peter answered him and said, “Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the waters.” 
\p
\v 29 He said, \wj “\+w Come\+w*!”\wj* 
\p Peter stepped down from the boat and walked on the waters to come to Yeshua. 
\v 30 But when he saw that the wind was strong, he was afraid, and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, “Lord, save me!” 
\p
\v 31 Immediately Yeshua stretched out his hand, took hold of him, and said to him, \wj “\+w You\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w little\+w* \+w faith\+w*, \+w why\+w* \+w did\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w doubt\+w*?”\wj* 
\v 32 When they got up into the boat, the wind ceased. 
\v 33 Those who were in the boat came and worshipped him, saying, “You are truly the Son of God!” 
\p
\v 34 When they had crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret. 
\v 35 When the people of that place recognised him, they sent into all that surrounding region and brought to him all who were sick; 
\v 36 and they begged him that they might just touch the fringe\f + \fr 14:36  \ft or, tassel\f* of his garment. As many as touched it were made whole. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1 Then Pharisees and scribes came to Yeshua from Jerusalem, saying, 
\v 2 “Why do your disciples disobey the tradition of the elders? For they don’t wash their hands when they eat bread.”

\v 3 He answered them, \wj “\+w Why\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w also\+w* \+w disobey\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w commandment\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w God\+w* \+w because\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w tradition\+w*? \wj*

\v 32 Yeshua summoned his disciples and said, \wj “\+w I\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w compassion\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w multitude\+w*, \+w because\+w* \+w they\+w* \+w have\+w* continued \+w with\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w now\+w* \+w three\+w* \+w days\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w nothing\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w eat\+w*. \+w I\+w* don’\+w t\+w* \+w want\+w* \+w to\+w* send \+w them\+w* away \+w fasting\+w*, \+w or\+w* \+w they\+w* \+w might\+w* \+w faint\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w way\+w*.” \wj* 
\p
\v 33 The disciples said to him, “Where could we get so many loaves in a deserted place as to satisfy so great a multitude?” 
\p
\v 34 Yeshua said to them, \wj “\+w How\+w* \+w many\+w* loaves \+w do\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w have\+w*?”\wj* 
\p They said, “Seven, and a few small fish.” 
\p
\v 35 He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground; 
\v 36 and he took the seven loaves and the fish. He gave thanks and broke them, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes. 
\v 37 They all ate and were filled. They took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over. 
\v 38 Those who ate were four thousand men, in addition to women and children. 
\v 39 Then he sent away the multitudes, got into the boat, and came into the borders of Magdala.

\v 1 The Pharisees and Sadducees came, and testing him, asked him to show them a sign from heaven. 
\v 2 But he answered them, \wj “\+w When\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w evening\+w*, \+w you\+w* \+w say\+w*, ‘\+w It\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w fair\+w* \+w weather\+w*, \+w for\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w sky\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w red\+w*.’ \wj*

\p He left them and departed. 
\v 5 The disciples came to the other side and had forgotten to take bread. 
\v 6 Yeshua said to them, \wj “\+w Take\+w* \+w heed\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w beware\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w yeast\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Pharisees\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w Sadducees\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 7 They reasoned amongst themselves, saying, “We brought no bread.”

\v 8 Yeshua, perceiving it, said, \wj “\+w Why\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w reason\+w* amongst \+w yourselves\+w*, \+w you\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w little\+w* \+w faith\+w*, \+w because\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w brought\+w* \+w no\+w* bread? \wj*

\p
\v 12 Then they understood that he didn’t tell them to beware of the yeast of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. 
\p
\v 13 Now when Yeshua came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, \wj “\+w Who\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w men\+w* \+w say\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w I\+w*, \+w the\+w* \+w Son\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Man\+w*, \+w am\+w*?”\wj* 
\p
\v 14 They said, “Some say Yochanan the Immerser, some, Elijah, and others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.”

\v 15 He said to them, \wj “\+w But\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w say\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w am\+w*?”\wj*

\v 16 Simon Peter answered, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.”

\v 20 Then he commanded the disciples that they should tell no one that he was Yeshua the Messiah. 
\p
\v 21 From that time, Yeshua began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up. 
\p
\v 22 Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, “Far be it from you, Lord! This will never be done to you.” 
\p
\v 23 But he turned and said to Peter, \wj “\+w Get\+w* \+w behind\+w* \+w me\+w*, \+w Satan\+w*! \+w You\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w stumbling\+w* \+w block\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w me\+w*, \+w for\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w setting\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w mind\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w things\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w God\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w things\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w men\+w*.”\wj*

\c 17  
\p
\v 1 After six days, Yeshua took with him Peter, Jacob, and Yochanan his brother, and brought them up into a high mountain by themselves. 
\v 2 He was changed\f + \fr 17:2  \ft or, transfigured\f* before them. His face shone like the sun, and his garments became as white as the light. 
\v 3 Behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them talking with him. 
\p
\v 4 Peter answered and said to Yeshua, “Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you want, let’s make three tents here: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” 
\p
\v 5 While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them. Behold, a voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to him.” 
\p
\v 6 When the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces, and were very afraid. 
\v 7 Yeshua came and touched them and said, \wj “\+w Get\+w* \+w up\+w*, \+w and\+w* don’\+w t\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w afraid\+w*.” \wj* 
\v 8 Lifting up their eyes, they saw no one, except Yeshua alone. 
\p
\v 9 As they were coming down from the mountain, Yeshua commanded them, saying, \wj “Don’\+w t\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w anyone\+w* \+w what\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w saw\+w*, \+w until\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Son\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Man\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w risen\+w* \+w from\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w dead\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 10 His disciples asked him, saying, “Then why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?” 
\p
\v 11 Yeshua answered them, \wj “\+w Elijah\+w* \+w indeed\+w* \+w comes\+w* \+w first\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w will\+w* restore \+w all\+w* \+w things\+w*; \wj*

\v 13 Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them of Yochanan the Immerser. 
\p
\v 14 When they came to the multitude, a man came to him, kneeling down to him and saying, 
\v 15 “Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is epileptic and suffers grievously; for he often falls into the fire, and often into the water. 
\v 16 So I brought him to your disciples, and they could not cure him.” 
\p
\v 17 Yeshua answered, \wj “Faithless \+w and\+w* \+w perverse\+w* \+w generation\+w*! \+w How\+w* \+w long\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w you\+w*? \+w How\+w* \+w long\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w bear\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w you\+w*? \+w Bring\+w* \+w him\+w* \+w here\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w me\+w*.”\wj* 
\v 18 Yeshua rebuked the demon, and it went out of him, and the boy was cured from that hour.

\v 19 Then the disciples came to Yeshua privately, and said, “Why weren’t we able to cast it out?” 
\p
\v 20 He said to them, \wj “\+w Because\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w your\+w* unbelief. \+w For\+w* most \+w certainly\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w*, \+w if\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w faith\+w* \+w as\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w grain\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w mustard\+w* \+w seed\+w*, \+w you\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w this\+w* \+w mountain\+w*, ‘\+w Move\+w* \+w from\+w* \+w here\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w there\+w*,’ \+w and\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w move\+w*; \+w and\+w* \+w nothing\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w be\+w* impossible \+w for\+w* \+w you\+w*. \wj*

\v 24 When they had come to Capernaum, those who collected the didrachma coins\f + \fr 17:24  \ft A didrachma is a Greek silver coin worth 2 drachmas, about as much as 2 Roman denarii, or about 2 days’ wages.

A shekel is about 10 grams or about 0.35 ounces.\f* came to Peter, and said, “Doesn’t your rabbi pay the didrachma?” 
\v 25 He said, “Yes.”

\v 6 The disciples went and did just as Yeshua commanded them, 
\v 7 and brought the donkey and the colt and laid their clothes on them; and he sat on them. 
\v 8 A very great multitude spread their clothes on the road. Others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.

\p
\v 12 Yeshua entered into the temple of God and drove out all of those who sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the money changers’ tables and the seats of those who sold the doves. 
\v 13 He said to them, \wj “\+w It\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w written\+w*, ‘\+w My\+w* \+w house\+w* \+w shall\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w called\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w house\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w prayer\+w*,’\wj*\x + \xo 21:13  \xt Isaiah 56:7\x* \wj \+w but\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w made\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w den\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w robbers\+w*!”\wj*\x + \xo 21:13  \xt Jeremiah 7:11\x*

\v 14 The lame and the blind came to him in the temple, and he healed them. 
\v 15 But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children who were crying in the temple and saying, “Hoshia'na to the son of David!” they were indignant, 
\v 16 and said to him, “Do you hear what these are saying?” 
\p Yeshua said to them, \wj “\+w Yes\+w*. \+w Did\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w never\+w* read, ‘\+w Out\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w mouth\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w children\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w nursing\+w* \+w babies\+w*, \+w you\+w* \+w have\+w* perfected praise’?”\wj*\x + \xo 21:16  \xt Psalms 8:2\x*

\p
\v 18 Now in the morning, as he returned to the city, he was hungry. 
\v 19 Seeing a fig tree by the road, he came to it and found nothing on it but leaves. He said to it, \wj “\+w Let\+w* \+w there\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w no\+w* \+w fruit\+w* \+w from\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w forever\+w*!” \wj* 
\p Immediately the fig tree withered away. 
\p
\v 20 When the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, “How did the fig tree immediately wither away?”

\v 21 Yeshua answered them, \wj “Most \+w certainly\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w*, \+w if\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w faith\+w* \+w and\+w* don’\+w t\+w* \+w doubt\+w*, \+w you\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w only\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w what\+w* \+w was\+w* \+w done\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w fig\+w* \+w tree\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w even\+w* \+w if\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w told\+w* \+w this\+w* \+w mountain\+w*, ‘\+w Be\+w* \+w taken\+w* \+w up\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w cast\+w* \+w into\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w sea\+w*,’ \+w it\+w* \+w would\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w done\+w*. \wj*

\v 23 When he had come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching, and said, “By what authority do you do these things? Who gave you this authority?”

\v 1 When Yeshua had finished all these words, he said to his disciples,

\p
\v 3 Then the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders of the people were gathered together in the court of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas. 
\v 4 They took counsel together that they might take Yeshua by deceit and kill him. 
\v 5 But they said, “Not during the feast, lest a riot occur amongst the people.” 
\p
\v 6 Now when Yeshua was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, 
\v 7 a woman came to him having an alabaster jar of very expensive ointment, and she poured it on his head as he sat at the table. 
\v 8 But when his disciples saw this, they were indignant, saying, “Why this waste? 
\v 9 For this ointment might have been sold for much and given to the poor.” 
\p
\v 10 However, knowing this, Yeshua said to them, \wj “\+w Why\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w trouble\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w woman\+w*? \+w She\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w done\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w good\+w* \+w work\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w me\+w*. \wj*

\p
\v 14 Then one of the twelve, who was called Judah Iscariot, went to the chief priests 
\v 15 and said, “What are you willing to give me if I deliver him to you?” So they weighed out for him thirty pieces of silver. 
\v 16 From that time he sought opportunity to betray him. 
\p
\v 17 Now on the first day of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Yeshua, saying to him, “Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?” 
\p
\v 18 He said, \wj “\+w Go\+w* \+w into\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w city\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w certain\+w* person, \+w and\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w him\+w*, ‘\+w The\+w* Rabbi \+w says\+w*, “\+w My\+w* \+w time\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w at\+w* \+w hand\+w*. \+w I\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w keep\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Passover\+w* \+w at\+w* \+w your\+w* house \+w with\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w disciples\+w*.”’”\wj* 
\p
\v 19 The disciples did as Yeshua commanded them, and they prepared the Passover. 
\p
\v 20 Now when evening had come, he was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples. 
\v 21 As they were eating, he said, \wj “\+w Most\+w* \+w certainly\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w one\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w betray\+w* \+w me\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 22 They were exceedingly sorrowful, and each began to ask him, “It isn’t me, is it, Lord?” 
\p
\v 23 He answered, \wj “\+w He\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w dipped\+w* \+w his\+w* \+w hand\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w the\+w* dish \+w will\+w* \+w betray\+w* \+w me\+w*. \wj*

\p
\v 25 Judah, who betrayed him, answered, “It isn’t me, is it, Rabbi?” 
\p He said to him, \wj “\+w You\+w* \+w said\+w* \+w it\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 26 As they were eating, Yeshua took bread, gave thanks for\f + \fr 26:26  \ft TR reads “blessed” instead of “gave thanks for”\f* it, and broke it. He gave to the disciples and said, \wj “\+w Take\+w*, \+w eat\+w*; \+w this\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w body\+w*.”\wj* 
\v 27 He took the cup, gave thanks, and gave to them, saying, \wj “\+w All\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w drink\+w* \+w it\+w*, \wj*

\p
\v 30 When they had sung the Hallel, they went out to the Mount of Olives. 
\p
\v 31 Then Yeshua said to them, \wj “\+w All\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w made\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w stumble\+w* \+w because\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w tonight\+w*, \+w for\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w written\+w*, ‘\+w I\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w strike\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w shepherd\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w sheep\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w flock\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w scattered\+w*.’\wj*\x + \xo 26:31  \xt Zechariah 13:7\x*

\p
\v 33 But Peter answered him, “Even if all will be made to stumble because of you, I will never be made to stumble.” 
\p
\v 34 Yeshua said to him, \wj “Most certainly \+w I\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w tonight\+w*, \+w before\+w* \+w the\+w* rooster \+w crows\+w*, \+w you\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w deny\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w three\+w* \+w times\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 35 Peter said to him, “Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you.” All of the disciples also said likewise. 
\p
\v 36 Then Yeshua came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to his disciples, \wj “\+w Sit\+w* \+w here\+w*, \+w while\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w go\+w* \+w there\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w pray\+w*.”\wj* 
\v 37 He took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and severely troubled. 
\v 38 Then Yeshua said to them, \wj “\+w My\+w* \+w soul\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w exceedingly\+w* \+w sorrowful\+w*, \+w even\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w death\+w*. \+w Stay\+w* \+w here\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w watch\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w me\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 39 He went forward a little, fell on his face, and prayed, saying, \wj “\+w My\+w* \+w Father\+w*, \+w if\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w possible\+w*, \+w let\+w* \+w this\+w* \+w cup\+w* \+w pass\+w* \+w away\+w* \+w from\+w* \+w me\+w*; \+w nevertheless\+w*, \+w not\+w* \+w what\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w desire\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w what\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w desire\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 40 He came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, \wj “\+w What\+w*, couldn’\+w t\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w watch\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w one\+w* \+w hour\+w*? \wj*

\p
\v 42 Again, a second time he went away and prayed, saying, \wj “\+w My\+w* \+w Father\+w*, \+w if\+w* \+w this\+w* \+w cup\+w* \+w can\+w*’\+w t\+w* \+w pass\+w* \+w away\+w* \+w from\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w unless\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w drink\+w* \+w it\+w*, \+w your\+w* \+w desire\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w done\+w*.” \wj* 
\p
\v 43 He came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. 
\v 44 He left them again, went away, and prayed a third time, saying the same words. 
\v 45 Then he came to his disciples and said to them, \wj “\+w Are\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w still\+w* \+w sleeping\+w* \+w and\+w* resting? \+w Behold\+w*, \+w the\+w* \+w hour\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w at\+w* \+w hand\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Son\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Man\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w betrayed\+w* \+w into\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w hands\+w* \+w of\+w* sinners. \wj*

\p
\v 47 While he was still speaking, behold, Judah, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people. 
\v 48 Now he who betrayed him had given them a sign, saying, “Whoever I kiss, he is the one. Seize him.” 
\v 49 Immediately he came to Yeshua, and said, “Greetings, Rabbi!” and kissed him. 
\p
\v 50 Yeshua said to him, \wj “\+w Friend\+w*, \+w why\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w here\+w*?”\wj* 
\p Then they came and laid hands on Yeshua, and took him.

\v 55 In that hour Yeshua said to the multitudes, \wj “\+w Have\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w come\+w* \+w out\+w* \+w as\+w* \+w against\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w robber\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w swords\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w clubs\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w seize\+w* \+w me\+w*? \+w I\+w* \+w sat\+w* \+w daily\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w temple\+w* \+w teaching\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w you\+w* didn’\+w t\+w* \+w arrest\+w* \+w me\+w*. \wj* 
\v 56  \wj \+w But\+w* \+w all\+w* \+w this\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w happened\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Scriptures\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w prophets\+w* \+w might\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w fulfilled\+w*.”\wj* 
\p Then all the disciples left him and fled. 
\p
\v 57 Those who had taken Yeshua led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together. 
\v 58 But Peter followed him from a distance to the court of the high priest, and entered in and sat with the officers, to see the end. 
\p
\v 59 Now the chief priests, the elders, and the whole council sought false testimony against Yeshua, that they might put him to death, 
\v 60 and they found none. Even though many false witnesses came forward, they found none. But at last two false witnesses came forward 
\v 61 and said, “This man said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.’” 
\p
\v 62 The high priest stood up and said to him, “Have you no answer? What is this that these testify against you?” 
\v 63 But Yeshua stayed silent. The high priest answered him, “I adjure you by the living God that you tell us whether you are the Messiah, the Son of God.” 
\p
\v 64 Yeshua said to him, \wj “\+w You\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w said\+w* \+w so\+w*. \+w Nevertheless\+w*, \+w I\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w*, \+w after\+w* \+w this\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w see\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Son\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Man\+w* \+w sitting\+w* \+w at\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w right\+w* \+w hand\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Power\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w coming\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w clouds\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w sky\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 65 Then the high priest tore his clothing, saying, “He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Behold, now you have heard his blasphemy. 
\v 66 What do you think?” 
\p They answered, “He is worthy of death!” 
\v 67 Then they spat in his face and beat him with their fists, and some slapped him, 
\v 68 saying, “Prophesy to us, you Messiah! Who hit you?” 
\p
\v 69 Now Peter was sitting outside in the court, and a maid came to him, saying, “You were also with Yeshua, the Galilean!” 
\p
\v 70 But he denied it before them all, saying, “I don’t know what you are talking about.” 
\p
\v 71 When he had gone out onto the porch, someone else saw him and said to those who were there, “This man also was with Yeshua of Nazareth.” 
\p
\v 72 Again he denied it with an oath, “I don’t know the man.” 
\p
\v 73 After a little while those who stood by came and said to Peter, “Surely you are also one of them, for your speech makes you known.” 
\p
\v 74 Then he began to curse and to swear, “I don’t know the man!” 
\p Immediately the rooster crowed. 
\v 75 Peter remembered the word which Yeshua had said to him, \wj “\+w Before\+w* \+w the\+w* rooster \+w crows\+w*, \+w you\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w deny\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w three\+w* \+w times\+w*.”\wj* Then he went out and wept bitterly. 
\c 27  
\p
\v 1 Now when morning had come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Yeshua to put him to death. 
\v 2 They bound him, led him away, and delivered him up to Pontius Pilate, the governor. 
\p
\v 3 Then Judah, who betrayed him, when he saw that Yeshua was condemned, felt remorse, and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, 
\v 4 saying, “I have sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood.” 
\p But they said, “What is that to us? You see to it.” 
\p
\v 5 He threw down the pieces of silver in the sanctuary and departed. Then he went away and hanged himself. 
\p
\v 6 The chief priests took the pieces of silver and said, “It’s not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is the price of blood.” 
\v 7 They took counsel, and bought the potter’s field with them to bury strangers in. 
\v 8 Therefore that field has been called “The Field of Blood” to this day. 
\v 9 Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah\f + \fr 27:9  \ft some manuscripts omit “Jeremiah”\f* the prophet was fulfilled, saying, 
\q1 “They took the thirty pieces of silver, 
\q2 the price of him upon whom a price had been set, 
\q2 whom some of the children of Israel priced, 
\q1
\v 10 and they gave them for the potter’s field, 
\q2 as the Lord commanded me.”\x + \xo 27:10  \xt Zechariah 11:12-13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9\x* 
\p
\v 11 Now Yeshua stood before the governor; and the governor asked him, saying, “Are you the King of the Jews?” 
\p Yeshua said to him, \wj “\+w So\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w say\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 12 When he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing. 
\v 13 Then Pilate said to him, “Don’t you hear how many things they testify against you?” 
\p
\v 14 He gave him no answer, not even one word, so that the governor marvelled greatly. 
\p
\v 15 Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release to the multitude one prisoner whom they desired. 
\v 16 They had then a notable prisoner called Barabbas. 
\v 17 When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas, or Yeshua who is called Messiah?” 
\v 18 For he knew that because of envy they had delivered him up. 
\p
\v 19 While he was sitting on the judgement seat, his wife sent to him, saying, “Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered many things today in a dream because of him.” 
\p
\v 20 Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes to ask for Barabbas and destroy Yeshua. 
\v 21 But the governor answered them, “Which of the two do you want me to release to you?” 
\p They said, “Barabbas!” 
\p
\v 22 Pilate said to them, “What then shall I do to Yeshua who is called Messiah?” 
\p They all said to him, “Let him be crucified!” 
\p
\v 23 But the governor said, “Why? What evil has he done?” 
\p But they cried out exceedingly, saying, “Let him be crucified!” 
\p
\v 24 So when Pilate saw that nothing was being gained, but rather that a disturbance was starting, he took water and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, “I am innocent of the blood of this righteous person. You see to it.” 
\p
\v 25 All the people answered, “May his blood be on us and on our children!” 
\p
\v 26 Then he released Barabbas to them, but Yeshua he flogged and delivered to be crucified. 
\p
\v 27 Then the governor’s soldiers took Yeshua into the Praetorium, and gathered the whole garrison together against him. 
\v 28 They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him. 
\v 29 They braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they knelt down before him and mocked him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” 
\v 30 They spat on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head. 
\v 31 When they had mocked him, they took the robe off him, and put his clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him. 
\p
\v 32 As they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name, and they compelled him to go with them, that he might carry his cross. 
\v 33 When they came to a place called “Golgotha”, that is to say, “The place of a skull,” 
\v 34 they gave him sour wine\f + \fr 27:34  \ft or, vinegar\f* to drink mixed with gall.\f + \fr 27:34  \ft Gall is a bitter-tasting, dark green oil from a wormwood plant that is alcoholic in its effect.\f* When he had tasted it, he would not drink. 
\v 35 When they had crucified him, they divided his clothing amongst them, casting lots,\f + \fr 27:35  \ft TR adds “that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet: ‘They divided my garments amongst them, and for my clothing they cast lots;’” [see Psalms 22:18 and Yochanan 19:24]\f* 
\v 36 and they sat and watched him there. 
\v 37 They set up over his head the accusation against him written, “THIS IS YESHUA, THE KING OF THE JEWS.” 
\p
\v 38 Then there were two robbers crucified with him, one on his right hand and one on the left. 
\p
\v 39 Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads 
\v 40 and saying, “You who destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!” 
\p
\v 41 Likewise the chief priests also mocking with the scribes, the Pharisees,\f + \fr 27:41  \ft TR omits “the Pharisees”\f* and the elders, said, 
\v 42 “He saved others, but he can’t save himself. If he is the King of Israel, let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him. 
\v 43 He trusts in God. Let God deliver him now, if he wants him; for he said, ‘I am the Son of God.’” 
\v 44 The robbers also who were crucified with him cast on him the same reproach. 
\p
\v 45 Now from the sixth hour\f + \fr 27:45  \ft noon\f* there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.\f + \fr 27:45  \ft 3:00 p.m.\f* 
\v 46 About the ninth hour Yeshua cried with a loud voice, saying, \wj “\+w Eli\+w*, \+w Eli\+w*, lima\wj*\f + \fr 27:46  \ft TR reads “lama” instead of “lima”\f* \wj \+w sabachthani\+w*?” \wj* That is, \wj “\+w My\+w* \+w God\+w*, \+w my\+w* \+w God\+w*, \+w why\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w forsaken\+w* \+w me\+w*?”\wj*\x + \xo 27:46  \xt Psalms 22:1\x* 
\p
\v 47 Some of them who stood there, when they heard it, said, “This man is calling Elijah.” 
\p
\v 48 Immediately one of them ran and took a sponge, filled it with vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave him a drink. 
\v 49 The rest said, “Let him be. Let’s see whether Elijah comes to save him.” 
\p
\v 50 Yeshua cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit. 
\p
\v 51 Behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom. The earth quaked and the rocks were split. 
\v 52 The tombs were opened, and many bodies of the holy ones who had fallen asleep were raised; 
\v 53 and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, they entered into the holy city and appeared to many. 
\p
\v 54 Now the centurion and those who were with him watching Yeshua, when they saw the earthquake and the things that were done, were terrified, saying, “Truly this was the Son of God!” 
\p
\v 55 Many women were there watching from afar, who had followed Yeshua from Galilee, serving him. 
\v 56 Amongst them were Miriam Magdalene, Miriam the mother of Jacob and Yosi, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. 
\p
\v 57 When evening had come, a rich man from Arimathaea named Joseph, who himself was also Yeshua’s disciple, came. 
\v 58 This man went to Pilate and asked for Yeshua’s body. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given up. 
\v 59 Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth 
\v 60 and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut out in the rock. Then he rolled a large stone against the door of the tomb, and departed. 
\v 61 Miriam Magdalene was there, and the other Miriam, sitting opposite the tomb. 
\p
\v 62 Now on the next day, which was the day after the Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together to Pilate, 
\v 63 saying, “Sir, we remember what that deceiver said while he was still alive: ‘After three days I will rise again.’ 
\v 64 Command therefore that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest perhaps his disciples come at night and steal him away, and tell the people, ‘He is risen from the dead;’ and the last deception will be worse than the first.” 
\p
\v 65 Pilate said to them, “You have a guard. Go, make it as secure as you can.” 
\v 66 So they went with the guard and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone. 
\c 28  
\p
\v 1 Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn on the first day of the week, Miriam Magdalene and the other Miriam came to see the tomb. 
\v 2 Behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from the sky and came and rolled away the stone from the door and sat on it. 
\v 3 His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow. 
\v 4 For fear of him, the guards shook, and became like dead men. 
\v 5 The angel answered the women, “Don’t be afraid, for I know that you seek Yeshua, who has been crucified. 
\v 6 He is not here, for he has risen, just like he said. Come, see the place where the Lord was lying. 
\v 7 Go quickly and tell his disciples, ‘He has risen from the dead, and behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there you will see him.’ Behold, I have told you.” 
\p
\v 8 They departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word. 
\v 9 As they went to tell his disciples, behold, Yeshua met them, saying, \wj “\+w Rejoice\+w*!”\wj* 
\p They came and took hold of his feet, and worshipped him. 
\p
\v 10 Then Yeshua said to them, \wj “Don’\+w t\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w afraid\+w*. \+w Go\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w my\+w* brothers \wj*\f + \fr 28:10  \ft The word for “brothers” here may be also correctly translated “brothers and sisters” or “siblings.”\f* \wj \+w that\+w* \+w they\+w* \+w should\+w* \+w go\+w* \+w into\+w* \+w Galilee\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w there\+w* \+w they\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w see\+w* \+w me\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 11 Now while they were going, behold, some of the guards came into the city and told the chief priests all the things that had happened. 
\v 12 When they were assembled with the elders and had taken counsel, they gave a large amount of silver to the soldiers, 
\v 13 saying, “Say that his disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept. 
\v 14 If this comes to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him and make you free of worry.” 
\v 15 So they took the money and did as they were told. This saying was spread abroad amongst the Judeans, and continues until today. 
\p
\v 16 But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Yeshua had sent them. 
\v 17 When they saw him, they bowed down to him; but some doubted. 
\v 18 Yeshua came to them and spoke to them, saying, \wj “\+w All\+w* \+w authority\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w been\+w* \+w given\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w heaven\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w earth\+w*. \wj*
