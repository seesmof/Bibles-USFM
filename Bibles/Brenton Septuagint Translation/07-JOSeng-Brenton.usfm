\v 1  \sc And\sc* it came to pass after the death of Moses, that the Lord spoke to Joshua the son of Naue, the minister of Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Moses my servant is dead; now then arise, go over Jordan, thou and all this people, into the land, which I give them. 
\v 3 Every spot on which ye shall tread I will give it you, as I said to Moses. 
\v 4 The wilderness and Antilibanus, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates, and as far as the \f + \fr 1:4  \fqa Or, \ft last, \fqa or, \ft farthest sea.\f*extremity of the sea; your coasts shall be from the setting of the sun. 
\v 5 Not a man shall stand against you all the days of thy life; and as I was with Moses, so will I also be with thee, and \x + \xo 1:5  \xt Heb. 13. 5.\x* I will not fail thee, or neglect thee. 
\v 6 Be strong and quit thyself like a man, for thou shalt divide the land to this people, which I sware to give to \f + \fr 1:6  \fqa Gr. \ft to your fathers, to give them.\f*your fathers. 
\v 7 Be strong, therefore, and quit thyself like a man, to observe and do as Moses my servant commanded thee; and thou shalt not turn \f + \fr 1:7  \fqa Gr. \ft from them, \fqa sc. \ft the commands.\f*therefrom to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest be wise in whatsoever thou mayest do. 
\v 8 And the book of this law shall not depart out of thy mouth, and thou shalt meditate in it day and night, that thou mayest know how to do all the things that are written \add in it\add*; then shalt thou prosper, and make thy ways prosperous, and then shalt thou be wise. 
\v 9 Lo! I have commanded thee; be strong and courageous, be not cowardly nor fearful, for the Lord thy God is with thee in all places whither thou goest. 
\v 10 And Joshua commanded the scribes of the people, saying, 
\v 11 Go into the midst of the camp of the people, and command the people, saying, Prepare provisions; for yet three days and ye \f + \fr 1:11  \fqa Gr. \ft do go over.\f*shall go over this Jordan, entering in to take possession of the land, which the Lord God of your fathers gives to you. 
\p
\v 12 And to Ruben, and to Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasse, Joshua said, 
\v 13 Remember the word which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you, saying, The Lord your God has caused you to rest, and has given you this land. 
\v 14 Let your wives and your children and your cattle dwell in the land, which he has given you; and ye shall go over \f + \fr 1:14  \fqa Or, \ft in good order.\f*well armed before your brethren, every one of you who is strong; and ye shall fight on their side; 
\v 15 until the Lord your God shall have given your brethren rest, as also to you, and they also shall have inherited the land, which the Lord your God gives them; then ye shall depart each one to his inheritance, which Moses gave you beyond Jordan eastward. 
\v 16 And they answered Joshua and said, We will do all things which thou commandest us, and we will go to every place whither thou shalt send us. 
\v 17 Whereinsoever we hearkened to Moses we will hearken to thee; only let the Lord our God be with thee, as he was with Moses. 
\v 18 And whosoever shall disobey thee, and whosoever shall not hearken to thy words as thou shalt command him, let him die; but be thou strong and courageous.

\p
\v 1 And Joshua the son of Naue sent out of Sattin two young men to spy \add the land\add*, saying, Go up and view the land and Jericho: and the two young men went and entered into Jericho; and they entered into the house of a harlot, whose name \add was\add* Raab, and lodged there. 
\p
\v 2 And it was reported to the king of Jericho, saying, Men of the sons of Israel have come in hither to spy the land. 
\v 3 And the king of Jericho sent and spoke to Raab, saying, Bring out the men that entered into thine house this night; for they are come to spy out the land. 
\v 4 And the woman took the two men and hid them; and she spoke to \f + \fr 2:4  \fqa Gr. \ft them.\f*the messengers, saying, The men came in to me, 
\v 5 but when the gate was shut in the \f + \fr 2:5  \fqa Gr. \ft dark.\f*evening, the men went out; I know not whither they are gone: follow after them, if ye \f + \fr 2:5  \fqa Gr. \ft shall.\f*may overtake them. 
\v 6 But she \add had\add* brought them up upon the house, and hid them in the flax-stalks that were spread by her on the house. 
\v 7 And the men followed after them in the way to Jordan to the fords; and the gate was shut. 
\p
\v 8 And it came to pass when the men who pursued after them were gone forth, and before the spies had lain down to sleep, that she came up to them on the top of the house; 
\v 9 and she said to them, I know that the Lord has given you the land; for the fear of you has fallen upon us. 
\v 10 For we have heard that the Lord God dried up the Red Sea before you, when ye came out of the land of Egypt, and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond Jordan, to Seon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed. 
\v 11 And when we heard it we were amazed in our heart, and there was no longer any spirit in any of us because of you, for the Lord your God \add is\add* God in heaven above, and on the earth beneath. 
\v 12 And now swear to me by the Lord God; since I deal mercifully with you, so do ye also deal mercifully with the house of my father: 
\v 13 and save alive the house of my father, my mother, and my brethren, and all my house, and all that they have, and ye shall rescue my soul from death. 
\p
\v 14 And the men said to her, Our life for yours \add even\add* to death: and she said, When the Lord shall have delivered the city to you, ye shall deal mercifully and truly with me. 
\v 15 And she let them down by the window; 
\v 16 and she said to them, Depart into the hill-country, lest the pursuers meet you, and ye shall be hidden there three days until your pursuers return from after you, and afterwards ye shall depart on your way. 
\p
\v 17 And the men said to her, We are clear of this thy oath. 
\v 18 Behold, \f + \fr 2:18  \fqa Gr. \ft do enter.\f*we shall enter into a part of the city, and thou shalt set \f + \fr 2:18  \fqa Gr. \ft the sign.\f*a sign; thou shalt bind this scarlet cord in the window, by which thou hast let us down, and thou shalt bring in to thyself, into thy house, thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all the family of thy father. 
\v 19 And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall go outside the door of thy house, his guilt shall be upon him, and we shall be quit of this thine oath; and we will be responsible for all that shall be found with thee in thy house. 
\v 20 But if any one should injure us, or betray these our matters, we shall be quit of this thine oath. 
\v 21 And she said to them, Let it be according to your word; and she sent them out, and they departed. 
\v 22 And they came to the hill-country, and remained there three days; and the pursuers searched all the roads, and found them not. 
\p
\v 23 And the two young men returned, and came down out of the mountain; and they went over to Joshua the son of Naue, and told him all things that had happened to them. 
\v 24 And they said to Joshua, The Lord has delivered all the land into our power, and all the inhabitants of that land tremble because of us. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and departed from Sattin; and they came as far as Jordan, and lodged there before they crossed over. 
\v 2 And it came to pass after three days, \add that\add* the scribes went through the camp; 
\v 3 and they charged the people, saying, When ye shall see the ark of the covenant of the Lord our God, and our priests and the Levites bearing it, ye shall depart from your places, and ye shall go after it. 
\v 4 But let there be a distance between you and it; ye shall stand as much as two thousand cubits \add from it\add*. Do not draw nigh to it, that ye may know the way which ye are to go; for ye have not gone the way \f + \fr 3:4  \fqa Gr. \ft from yesterday and the third day. A frequent \fqa Hebraism.\f*before. 
\p
\v 5 And Joshua said to the people, Sanctify yourselves against to-morrow, for to-morrow the Lord will do wonders among you. 
\v 6 And Joshua said to the priests, Take up the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and go before the people: and the priests took up the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and went before the people. 
\v 7 And the Lord said to Joshua, This day do I begin to exalt thee before all the children of Israel, that they may know that as I was with Moses, so will I also be with thee. 
\v 8 And now charge the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, As soon as ye shall enter on a part of the water of Jordan, then ye shall stand in Jordan. 
\p
\v 9 And Joshua said to the children of Israel, \f + \fr 3:9  \fqa Gr. \ft bring hither. \fqa sc. \ft yourselves.\f*Come hither, and hearken to the word of the Lord our God. 
\v 10 Hereby ye shall know that the living God \add is\add* among you, and will utterly destroy from before our face the Chananite, and the Chettite and Pherezite, and the Evite, and the Amorite, and the Gergesite, and the Jebusite. 
\v 11 Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passes over Jordan. 
\v 12 Choose for yourselves twelve men of the sons of Israel, one of each tribe. 
\v 13 And it shall come to pass, when the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord of the whole earth rest in the water of Jordan, the water of Jordan \add below\add* shall fail, and the water coming down from above shall stop. 
\p
\v 14 And the people removed from their tents to cross over Jordan, and the priests bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord before the people. 
\v 15 And when the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord entered upon Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord were dipped in part of the water of Jordan; (now Jordan \f + \fr 3:15  \fqa Gr. \ft its whole channel.\f*overflowed all its banks \f + \fr 3:15  \fqa Gr. \ft as on the days.\f*about the time of wheat harvest:) 
\v 16 then the waters that came down from above stopped; there stood one solid heap very far off, as far as \f + \fr 3:16  \fqa Gr. \ft a part.\f*the region of Kariathiarim, and \f + \fr 3:16  \fqa Gr. \ft that which came down.\f*the lower part came down to the sea of Araba, the salt sea, till it completely failed; and the people stood opposite Jericho. 
\v 17 And the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord stood on dry land in the midst of Jordan; and all the children of Israel went through on dry land, until all the people had completely gone over Jordan. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 And when the people had completely passed over Jordan, the Lord spoke to Joshua, saying, 
\v 2 Take men from the people, one of each tribe, 
\v 3 and charge them; and ye shall take out of the midst of Jordan twelve \f + \fr 4:3  \fqa Gr. \ft ready. \fqa Heb. \ft הכין. \fqa A. V. \ft firm, applied to the foot of the priests.\f*fit stones, and having carried them across together with yourselves, place them in your camp, where ye shall encamp for the night. 
\p
\v 4 And Joshua having called twelve men \f + \fr 4:4  \fqa Gr. \ft of the distinguished, or, illustrious.\f*of distinction among the children of Israel, one of each tribe, 
\v 5 said to them, Advance before me in the presence of the Lord into the midst of Jordan, and each having taken up a stone from thence, let him carry it on his shoulders, according to the number of the twelve tribes of Israel: 
\v 6 that these may be to you continually for an appointed sign, that when thy son asks thee \f + \fr 4:6  \fqa Gr. \ft to-morrow.\f*in future, saying, What are these stones to us? 
\v 7 then thou mayest explain to thy son, saying, The river Jordan was \f + \fr 4:7  \fqa Gr. \ft failed.\f*dried up from before the ark of the covenant of the Lord of the whole earth, when it passed it: and these stones shall be for a memorial for you for the children of Israel for ever. 
\p
\v 8 And the children of Israel did so, as the Lord commanded Joshua; and they took up twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, (as the Lord commanded Joshua, when the children of Israel had completely passed over,) and carried these stones with them into the camp, and laid them down there. 
\v 9 And Joshua set also other twelve stones in Jordan itself, in the place that was under the feet of the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord; and there they are to this day. 
\p
\v 10 And the priests that bore the ark of the covenant stood in Jordan, until Joshua \add had\add* finished all that the Lord commanded him to report to the people; and the people hasted and passed over. 
\v 11 And it came to pass when all the people had passed over, that the ark of the covenant of the Lord passed over, and the stones before them. 
\v 12 And the sons of Ruben, and the sons of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse passed over \f + \fr 4:12  \fqa Or, \ft equipped.\f*armed before the children of Israel, as Moses commanded them. 
\v 13 Forty thousand \f + \fr 4:13  \fqa Gr. \ft in good order.\f*armed for battle went over before the Lord to war, to the city of Jericho. 
\v 14 In that day the Lord magnified Joshua before all the people of Israel; and they feared him, as \add they did\add* Moses, as long as he lived. 
\p
\v 15 And the Lord spoke to Joshua, saying, 
\v 16 Charge the priests that bear the ark of the covenant of the testimony of the Lord, to go up out of Jordan. 
\v 17 And Joshua charged the priests, saying, Go up out of Jordan. 
\v 18 And it came to pass when the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord were gone up out of Jordan, and set their feet upon the land, \add that\add* the water of Jordan returned impetuously to its place, and went as before over all its banks. 
\p
\v 19 And the people went up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month; and the children of Israel encamped in Galgala in the region eastward from Jericho. 
\v 20 And Joshua set these twelve stones which he took out of Jordan, in Galgala, 
\v 21 saying, When your sons ask you, saying, What are these stones? 
\v 22 Tell your sons, that Israel went over this Jordan on dry land, 
\v 23 when the Lord our God had dried up the water of Jordan from before them, until they had passed over; as the Lord our God did to the Red Sea, which the Lord our God dried up from before us, until we passed over. 
\v 24 That all the nations of the earth might know, that the power of the Lord is mighty, and that ye might worship the Lord our God in every work. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass when the kings of the Amorites who were beyond Jordan heard, and the kings of Phœnicia by the sea, that the Lord God had dried up the river Jordan from before the children of Israel when they passed over, that their hearts failed, and \f + \fr 5:1  \fqa Gr. \ft their minds or thoughts melted.\f*they were terror-stricken, and there was no sense in them \f + \fr 5:1  \fqa Gr. \ft from the face of.\f*because of the children of Israel. 
\p
\v 2 And about this time the Lord said to Joshua, Make thee stone knives of sharp stone, and sit down and circumcise the children of Israel the second time. 
\v 3 And Joshua made sharp knives of stone, and circumcised the children of Israel at the place called the “Hill of Foreskins.” 
\v 4 And \add this is\add* the way in which Joshua purified the children of Israel; as many as were born in the way, and as many as were uncircumcised of them that came out of Egypt, 
\v 5 all these Joshua circumcised; for forty and two years Israel wandered in the wilderness of Mabdaris— 
\v 6 Wherefore most of the fighting men that came out of the land of Egypt, were uncircumcised, who disobeyed the commands of God; concerning whom also he determined that they should not see the land, which the Lord sware to give to their fathers, \add even\add* a land flowing with milk and honey. 
\v 7 And in their place he raised up their sons, whom Joshua circumcised, because they were uncircumcised, having been born by the way. 
\v 8 And when they had been circumcised they rested \f + \fr 5:8  \fqa Gr. \ft sitting. A frequent \fqa Hebraism.\f*continuing there in the camp till they were healed. 
\v 9 And the Lord said to Joshua the son of Naue, On this day have I removed the reproach of Egypt from you: and he called the name of that place Galgala. 
\p
\v 10 And the children of Israel kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, to the westward of Jericho on the opposite side of the Jordan in the plain. 
\v 11 And they ate of the grain of the earth unleavened and new \add corn\add*. 
\v 12 In this day the manna failed, after they had eaten of the corn of the land, and the children of Israel no longer had manna; and they took the fruits of the land of the Phœnicians in that year. 
\p
\v 13 And it came to pass when Joshua was in Jericho, that he looked up with his eyes and saw a man standing before him, and \add there was\add* a drawn sword in his hand; and Joshua drew near and said to him, Art thou for us or on the side of our enemies? 
\v 14 And he said to him, I am now come, the chief captain of the host of the Lord. And Joshua fell on his face upon the earth, and said to him, Lord, what commandest thou thy servant? 
\v 15 And the captain of the Lord's host said to Joshua, Loose thy shoe off thy feet, for the place whereon thou now standest is holy. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1 Now Jericho was closely shut up and besieged, and none went out of it, and none came in. 
\v 2 And the Lord said to Joshua, Behold, I deliver Jericho into thy power, and its king in it, \f + \fr 6:2  \fqa Gr. \ft mighty in strength.\f*\add and its\add* mighty men. 
\v 3 And do thou set the men of war round about it. 
\v 5 And it shall be \add that\add* when ye shall sound with the trumpet, \f + \fr 6:5  \fqa Gr. \ft let all the people, etc.\f*all the people shall shout together. And when they have shouted, the walls of the city shall fall \f + \fr 6:5  \fqa Or, \ft of their own accord.\f*of themselves; and all the people shall enter, each one rushing direct into the city. 
\p
\v 6 And Joshua the \add son\add* of Naue went in to the priests, 
\v 7 and spoke to them, saying, Charge the people to go round, and encompass the city; and let your men of war pass on armed before the Lord. 
\v 8 And let seven priests having seven \f + \fr 6:8  \fqa Heb. \ft שופרות היובלים \fqa A. V. \ft ‘ram's horns.’ Only in this place.\f*sacred trumpets proceed thus before the Lord, and let them sound loudly; and let the ark of the covenant of the Lord follow. 
\v 9 And let the men of war proceed before, and the priests bringing up the rear behind the ark of the covenant of the Lord \add proceed\add* sounding the trumpets. 
\v 10 And Joshua commanded the people, saying, Cry not out, nor let any one hear your voice, until he himself declare to you the \f + \fr 6:10  \fqa Gr. \ft day.\f*time to cry out, and then ye shall cry out. 
\v 11 And the ark of the covenant of God having gone round immediately returned into the camp, and lodged there. 
\p
\v 12 And on the second day Joshua rose up in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the covenant of the Lord. 
\v 13 And the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets went on before the Lord; and afterwards the men of war went on, and the remainder of the multitude went after the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and the priests sounded with the trumpets. 
\v 14 And all the rest of the multitude compassed the city six times from within a short distance, and went back again into the camp; this they did six days. 
\p
\v 15 And on the seventh day they rose up early, and compassed the city on that day seven times. 
\v 16 And it came to pass at the seventh circuit the priests blew the trumpets; and Joshua said to the children of Israel, Shout, for the Lord has given you the city. 
\v 17 And the city shall be \f + \fr 6:17  \fqa Or, \ft an accursed thing.\f*devoted, it and all things that are in it, to the Lord of Hosts: only do ye save Raab the harlot, and all things in her house. 
\v 18 But keep yourselves strictly from the accursed thing, lest ye set your mind upon and take of the accursed thing, and ye make the camp of the children of Israel an accursed thing, and destroy us. 
\v 19 And all the silver, or gold, or brass, or iron, shall be holy to the Lord; it shall be carried into the treasury of the Lord. 
\p
\v 20 And the priests sounded with the trumpets: and when the people heard the trumpets, all the people shouted at once with a loud and strong shout; and all the wall fell round about, and all the people went up into the city: 
\v 21 and Joshua devoted it to destruction, and all things that were in the city, man and woman, young man and old, and calf and ass, with the \f + \fr 6:21  \fqa Gr. \ft mouth.\f*edge of the sword. 
\p
\v 22 And Joshua said to the two young men who had acted as spies, Go into the house of the woman, and bring her out thence, and all that she has. 
\v 23 And the two young men who had spied out the city entered into the house of the woman, and brought out Raab the harlot, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and her kindred, and all that she had; and they set her without the camp of Israel. 
\v 24 And the city was burnt with fire with all things that were in it; only of the silver, and gold, and brass, and iron, they gave to be brought into the treasury of the Lord. 
\p
\v 25 And Joshua saved alive Raab the harlot, and all the house of her father, and caused her to dwell in Israel until this day, because she hid the spies which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho. 
\v 26 And Joshua adjured \add them\add* on that day before the Lord, saying, Cursed \add be\add* the man who shall build that city: he shall lay the foundation of it in his first-born, and he shall set up the gates of it in his youngest son. And so did Hozan of Bæthel; he laid the foundation in Abiron his first-born, and set up the gates of it in his youngest \f + \fr 6:26  \fqa Gr. \ft saved.\f*surviving son. 
\p
\v 27 And the Lord was with Joshua, and his name was in all the land. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1 But the children of Israel committed a great trespass, and purloined \add part\add* of the accursed thing; and Achar the son of Charmi, the son of Zambri, the son of Zara, of the tribe of Juda, took of the accursed thing; and the Lord was very angry with the children of Israel. 
\p
\v 2 And Joshua sent men to Gai, which is by Bæthel, saying, Spy out Gai: and the men went up and spied Gai. 
\v 3 And they returned to Joshua, and said to him, Let not all the people go up, but let about two or three thousand men go up and take the city by siege: carry not up thither the whole people, for \add the enemy\add* are few. 
\v 4 And there went up about three thousand men, and they fled from before the men of Gai. 
\v 5 And the men of Gai slew of them to the number of thirty-six men, and they pursued them from the gate, and destroyed them from the steep hill; and the heart of the people was alarmed and became as water. 
\p
\v 6 And Joshua tore his garments; and Joshua fell on the earth on his face before the Lord until evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they cast dust on their heads. 
\v 7 And Joshua said, I pray, Lord, wherefore has thy servant brought this people over Jordan to deliver them to the Amorite to destroy us? \f + \fr 7:7  \fqa Gr. \ft and if we had.\f*would we had remained and settled ourselves beyond Jordan. 
\v 8 And what shall I say since Israel has turned his \f + \fr 7:8  \fqa Gr. \ft neck. \fqa Heb. \ft ערף the back of the neck.\f*back before his enemy? 
\v 9 And when the Chananite and all the inhabitants of the land hear it, they shall compass us round and destroy us from off the land: and what wilt thou do \add for\add* thy great name? 
\p
\v 10 And the Lord said to Joshua, Rise up; why hast thou fallen upon thy face? 
\v 11 The people has sinned, and transgressed the covenant which I made with them; they have stolen from the cursed thing, and put it into their store. 
\v 12 And the children of Israel will not be able to stand before their enemies; they will turn their \f + \fr 7:12  \fqa Gr. \ft neck. \fqa Heb. \ft ערף the back of the neck.\f*back before their enemies, for they have become an accursed thing: I will not any longer be with you, unless ye remove the cursed thing from yourselves. 
\v 13 Rise, sanctify the people and tell them to sanctify themselves for the morrow: thus says the Lord God of Israel, The accursed thing is among you; ye shall not be able to stand before your enemies, until ye shall have removed the cursed thing from among you. 
\v 14 And ye shall all be gathered together by your tribes in the morning, and it shall come to pass that the tribe which the Lord shall shew, ye shall bring by families; and the family which the Lord shall shew, ye shall bring by households; and the household which the Lord shall shew, ye shall bring man by man. 
\v 15 And the man who shall be pointed out, shall be burnt with fire, and all that he has; because he has transgressed the covenant of the Lord, and has wrought wickedness in Israel. 
\p
\v 16 And Joshua rose up early, and brought the people by their tribes; and the tribe of Juda was pointed out. 
\v 17 And it was brought by their families, and the family of the Zaraites was pointed out. 
\v 18 And it was brought man by man, and Achar the son of Zambri the son of Zara was pointed out. 
\p
\v 19 And Joshua said to Achar, Give glory this day to the Lord God of Israel, and make confession; and tell me what thou hast done, and hide it not from me. 
\v 20 And Achar answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the Lord God of Israel: thus and thus have I done: 
\v 21 I saw in the spoil an embroidered mantle, and two hundred didrachms of silver, and one golden wedge of fifty didrachms, and I desired them and took them; and, behold, they are hid in my tent, and the silver is hid under them. 
\v 22 And Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent into the camp; and these things were hidden in his tent, and the silver under them. 
\v 23 And they brought them out of the tent, and brought them to Joshua and the elders of Israel, and they laid them before the Lord. 
\p
\v 24 And Joshua took Achar the son of Zara, and brought him to the valley of Achor, and his sons, and his daughters, and his calves, and his asses, and all his sheep, and his tent, and all his property, and all the people \add were\add* with him; and he brought them to \f + \fr 7:24  \fqa Heb. \ft עמק עכור valley of trouble.\f*Emec Achor. 
\v 25 And Joshua said to Achar, Why hast thou destroyed us? the Lord destroy thee \f + \fr 7:25  \fqa Gr. \ft as also to-day.\f*as at this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones. 
\v 26 And they set up over him a great heap of stones; and the Lord ceased from his fierce anger. Therefore he called \f + \fr 7:26  \fqa Gr. \ft it.\f*the place Emecachor until this day. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord said to Joshua, Fear not, nor be timorous: take with thee all the men of war, and arise, go up to Gai; behold, I have given into thy hands the king of Gai, and his land. 
\v 2 And thou shalt do to Gai, as thou didst to Jericho and its king; and thou shalt take to thyself the spoil of its cattle; set now for thyself an ambush for the city behind. 
\p
\v 3 And Joshua and all the men of war rose to go up to Gai; and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men, and he sent them away by night. 
\v 4 And he charged them, saying, Do ye lie in ambush behind the city: do not go far from the city, and ye shall all be ready. 
\v 5 And I and all with me will draw near to the city: and it shall come to pass when the inhabitants of Gai shall come forth to meet us, as before, that we will flee from before them. 
\v 6 And when they shall come out after us, we will draw them away from the city; and they will say, These men flee from before us, as also before. 
\v 7 And ye shall rise up out of the ambuscade, and go into the city. 
\v 8 Ye shall do according to this word, lo! I have commanded you. 
\v 9 And Joshua sent them, and they went to lie in ambush; and they lay between Bæthel and Gai, westward of Gai. 
\p
\v 10 And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and \f + \fr 8:10  \fqa Gr. \ft reviewed.\f*numbered the people; and he went up, he and the elders before the people to Gai. 
\v 11 And all the men of war went up with him, and they went forward and came over against the city eastward. 
\v 12 And the ambuscade \add was\add* on the west side of the city. 
\v 14 And it came to pass when the king of Gai saw \add it\add*, he hasted and went out to meet them direct to the battle, he and all the people \add that were\add* with him: and he knew not that there was an ambuscade \add formed\add* against him behind the city. 
\v 15 And Joshua and Israel saw, and retreated from before them. 
\v 16 And they pursued after the children of Israel, and they themselves went to a distance from the city. 
\v 17 There was no one left in Gai who did not pursue after Israel; and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel. 
\p
\v 18 And the Lord said to Joshua, Stretch forth thy hand with the spear that is in thy hand toward the city, for I have delivered it into thy hands; and the liers in wait shall rise up quickly out of their place. 
\v 19 And Joshua stretched out his hand \add and\add* his spear toward the city, and the ambuscade rose up quickly out of their place; and they came forth when he stretched out his hand; and they entered into the city, and took it; and they hasted and \f + \fr 8:19  \fqa Or, \ft set it on fire.\f*burnt the city with fire. 
\p
\v 20 And when the inhabitants of Gai looked round behind them, then they saw the smoke going up out of the city to heaven, and they were no longer able to flee this way or that way. 
\v 21 And Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambuscade \f + \fr 8:21  \fqa Gr. \ft took.\f*had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city went up to heaven; and they turned and smote the men of Gai. 
\v 22 And these came forth out of the city to meet them; and they were in the midst of the army, some \add being\add* on this side, and some on that; and they smote them until there was not left of them one who survived and escaped. 
\v 23 And they took the king of Gai alive, and brought him to Joshua. 
\p
\v 24 And when the children of Israel had ceased slaying all that were in Gai, and in the fields, and in the mountain on the descent, from whence they pursued them \add even\add* to the end, then Joshua returned to Gai, and smote it with the edge of the sword. 
\v 25 And they that fell in that day, men and women, were twelve thousand: \add they slew\add* all the inhabitants of Gai. 
\v 27 Beside the spoils that were in the city, all things which the children of Israel took as spoil for themselves according to the command of the Lord, as the Lord commanded Joshua. 
\p
\v 28 And Joshua burnt the city with fire: he made it an uninhabited heap for ever, \add even\add* to this day. 
\v 29 And he hanged the king of Gai on a \f + \fr 8:29  \fqa Gr. \ft double tree.\f*gallows; and he remained on the tree till evening: and when the sun went down, Joshua gave charge, and they took down his body from the tree, and cast it into \f + \fr 8:29  \fqa Gr. \ft the pit or trench. For vv. 30-35, see chap. \xt 9. 2.\f*a pit, and they set over him a heap of stones until this day. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 And when the kings of the Amorites on the other side of Jordan, who were in the mountain country, and in the plain, and in all the coast of the great sea, and those who were near Antilibanus, and the Chettites, and the Chananites, and the Pherezites, and the Evites, and the Amorites, and the Gergesites, and the Jebusites, heard \add of it\add*, 
\v 2 they came all together at the same time to make war against Joshua and Israel. 
\p
\v 2a Then Joshua built an altar to the Lord God of Israel in mount Gæbal, 
\v 2b as Moses the servant of the Lord commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the law of Moses, an altar of unhewn stones, on which iron \f + \fr 9:2b  \fqa Gr. \ft was not lifted up.\f*had not been lifted up; and he offered there whole-burnt-offerings to the Lord, and a peace-offering. 
\v 2c And Joshua wrote upon the stones \f + \fr 9:2c  \fqa Or, \ft a Deuteronomy.\f*a copy of the law, \add even\add* the law of Moses, before the children of Israel. 
\v 2d And all Israel, and their elders, and their judges, and their scribes, passed on one side and on the other before the ark; and the priests and the Levites took up the ark of the covenant of the Lord; and the stranger and the native \add were there\add*, who were half of them near mount Garizin, and half near mount Gæbal, as Moses the servant of the Lord commanded at first, to bless the people. 
\p
\v 2e And afterwards Joshua read accordingly all the words of this law, the blessings and the curses, according to all things written in the law of Moses. 
\v 2f There was not a word of all that Moses charged Joshua, which Joshua read not in the ears of all the assembly of the children of Israel, the men, and the women, and the children, and the strangers that joined themselves to Israel. 
\p
\v 3 And the inhabitants of Gabaon heard of all that the Lord did to Jericho and Gai. 
\v 4 And they also wrought craftily, and they went and made provision and prepared themselves; and having taken old sacks on their shoulders, and old and rent and patched bottles of wine, 
\v 5 and the upper part of their shoes and their sandals old and clouted on their feet, and their garments old upon them—and the bread of their provision was dry and mouldy and \f + \fr 9:5  \fqa Gr. \ft eaten, \fqa sc. \ft of worms and maggots.\f*corrupt. 
\p
\v 6 And they came to Joshua into the camp of Israel to Galgala, and said to Joshua and Israel, We are come from a far land: now then make a covenant with us. 
\v 7 And the children of Israel said to the Chorrhæan, Peradventure thou dwellest amongst us; and how should I make a covenant with thee? 
\v 8 And they said to Joshua, We are thy servants: and Joshua said to them, Whence are ye, and whence have ye come? 
\v 9 And they said, Thy servants are come from a very far country in the name of the Lord thy God: for we have heard his name, and all that he did in Egypt, 
\v 10 and all that he did to the kings of the Amorites, who were beyond Jordan, to Seon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Basan, who dwelt in Astaroth and in Edrain. 
\v 11 And our elders and all that inhabit our land when they heard spoke to us, saying, Take to yourselves provision for the way, and go to meet them; and ye shall say to them, We are thy servants, and now make a covenant with us. 
\v 12 These \add are\add* the loaves—we took them hot for our journey on the day on which we came out to come to you; and now they are dried and become mouldy. 
\v 13 And these \add are\add* the skins of wine which we filled when new, and they are rent; and our garments and our shoes are worn out because of the very long journey. 
\p
\v 14 And the chiefs took of their provision, and asked not \add counsel of\add* the Lord. 
\v 15 And Joshua made peace with them, and they made a covenant with them to preserve them; and the princes of the congregation sware to them. 
\p
\v 16 And it came to pass \f + \fr 9:16  \fqa Gr. \ft after three days after, etc.\f*three days after they had made a covenant with them, they heard that they were near neighbours, and that they \f + \fr 9:16  \fqa Gr. \ft dwell.\f*dwelt among them. 
\v 17 And the children of Israel departed and came to their cities; and their cities \add were\add* Gabaon, and Kephira, and Berot, and the cities of Jarin. 
\v 18 And the children of Israel fought not with them, because all the princes sware to them by the Lord God of Israel; and all the congregation murmured at the princes. 
\p
\v 19 And the princes said to all the congregation: We have sworn to them by the Lord God of Israel, and now we shall not be able to touch them. 
\v 20 This we will do; take them alive, and we will preserve them: so there shall not be wrath against us by reason of the oath which we swore to them. 
\v 21 They shall live, and shall be hewers of wood and drawers of water to all the congregation, as the princes said to them. 
\p
\v 22 And Joshua called them together and said to them, Why have ye deceived me, saying, We live very far from you; whereas ye are fellow-countrymen of those who dwell among us? 
\v 23 And now ye are cursed: there shall not fail of you a slave, or a hewer of wood, or a drawer of water to me and my God. 
\v 24 And they answered Joshua, saying, It was reported to us what the Lord thy God charged his servant Moses, to give you this land, and to destroy us and all that dwelt on it from before you; and we feared very much for our lives \f + \fr 9:24  \fqa Gr. \ft from before you.\f*because of you, and \add therefore\add* we did this thing. 
\v 25 And now, behold, we \add are\add* in your power; do to us as it is pleasing to you, and as it seems \add good\add* to you. 
\p
\v 26 And they did so to them; and Joshua rescued them in that day out of the hands of the children of Israel, and they did not slay them. 
\v 27 And Joshua made them in that day hewers of wood and drawers of water to the whole congregation, and for the altar of God: therefore the inhabitants of Gabaon became hewers of wood and drawers of water for the altar of God until this day, even for the place which the Lord should choose. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1 And when Adoni-bezec king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had taken Gai, and had destroyed it, as he did to Jericho and its king, even so they did to Gai and its king, and that the inhabitants of Gabaon had gone over to Joshua and Israel; 
\v 2 then they were greatly terrified by them, for \add the king\add* knew that Gabaon \add was\add* a great city, as one of the \f + \fr 10:2  \fqa Gr. \ft mother-cities.\f*chief cities, and all its men \add were\add* mighty. 
\v 3 So Adoni-bezec king of Jerusalem sent to Elam king of Hebron, and to Phidon king of Jerimuth, and to Jephtha king of Lachis, and to Dabin king of Odollam, saying, 
\v 4 Come up hither to me, and help me, and let us take Gabaon; for the \f + \fr 10:4  \fqa Gr. \ft they.\f*Gabaonites have gone over to Joshua and to the children of Israel. 
\v 5 And the five kings of the Jebusites went up, the king of Jerusalem, and the king of Chebron, and the king of Jerimuth, and the king of Lachis, and the king of Odollam, they and all their people; and encamped around Gabaon, and besieged it. 
\p
\v 6 And the inhabitants of Gabaon sent to Joshua into the camp to Galgala, saying, Slack not thy hands from thy servants: come up quickly to us, and help us, and rescue us; for all the kings of the Amorites who dwell in the hill country are gathered together against us. 
\v 7 And Joshua went up from Galgala, he and all the people of war with him, every one mighty in strength. 
\p
\v 8 And the Lord said to Joshua, Fear them not, for I have delivered them into thy hands; there shall not one of them be left before you. 
\p
\v 9 And when Joshua came suddenly upon them, he \add had\add* advanced all the night out of Galgala. 
\v 10 And the Lord struck them with terror before the children of Israel; and the Lord destroyed them with a great slaughter at Gabaon; and they pursued them by the way of the going up of Oronin, and they smote them to Azeca and to Makeda. 
\v 11 And when they fled from the face of the children of Israel at the descent of Oronin, then the Lord cast upon them hailstones from heaven to Azeca; and they were more that died by the hailstones, than those whom the children of Israel slew with the sword in the battle. 
\p
\v 12 Then Joshua spoke to the Lord, in the day in which the Lord delivered the Amorite into the power of Israel, when he destroyed them in Gabaon, and they were destroyed from before the children of Israel: and Joshua said, Let the sun stand over against Gabaon, and the moon over against the valley of Ælon. 
\v 13 And the sun and the moon stood still, until God executed vengeance on their enemies; and the sun stood still in the midst of heaven; it did not proceed to set till the end of \f + \fr 10:13  \fqa i. e. \ft additional day without a night between.\f*one day. 
\v 14 And there was not such a day either before or after, so that God should hearken to a man, because the Lord fought on the side of Israel. 
\p
\v 16 And these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave that is in Makeda. 
\v 17 And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings have been found hid in the cave that is in Makeda. 
\v 18 And Joshua said, Roll stones to the mouth of the cave, and set men to watch over them. 
\v 19 But do not ye stand, but pursue after your enemies, and \f + \fr 10:19  \fqa Gr. \ft fasten upon or seize.\f*attack the rear of them, and do not suffer them to enter into their cities; for the Lord our God has delivered them into our hands. 
\v 20 And it came to pass when Joshua and all Israel ceased destroying them utterly with a very great slaughter, that they that escaped took refuge in the strong cities. 
\p
\v 21 And all the people returned \f + \fr 10:21  \fqa Gr. \ft sound, or healthy.\f*safe to Joshua to Makeda; and no one of the children of Israel murmured with his tongue. 
\p
\v 22 And Joshua said, Open the cave, and bring out these five kings out of the cave. 
\v 23 And they brought out the five kings out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, and the king of Chebron, and the king of Jerimuth, and the king of Lachis, and the king of Odollam. 
\v 24 And when they brought them out to Joshua, then Joshua called together all Israel, and the chiefs \f + \fr 10:24  \fqa Gr. \ft of the war.\f*of the army that went with him, saying to them, Come forward and set your feet on their necks; and they came and set their feet on their necks. 
\v 25 And Joshua said to them, Do not fear them, neither be cowardly; be courageous and strong, for thus the Lord will do to all your enemies, against whom ye fight. 
\v 26 And Joshua slew them, and hanged them on five trees; and they hung upon the trees until the evening. 
\v 27 And it came to pass toward the setting of the sun, Joshua commanded, and they took them down from the trees, and cast them into the cave into which they \add had\add* fled for refuge, and rolled stones to the cave, \add which remain\add* till this day. 
\p
\v 28 And they took Makeda on that day, and slew \f + \fr 10:28  \fqa Gr. \ft it.\f*the inhabitants with the \f + \fr 10:28  \fqa Gr. \ft mouth.\f*edge of the sword, and they utterly destroyed every living thing that was in it; and there was none left in it that was preserved and had escaped; and they did to the king of Makeda, as they did to the king of Jericho. 
\p
\v 29 And Joshua and all Israel with him departed out of Makeda to Lebna, and besieged Lebna. 
\v 30 And the Lord delivered it into the hands of Israel: and they took it, and its king, and slew the inhabitants with the edge of the sword, and every thing breathing in it; and there was not left in it any that survived and escaped; and they did to its king, as they did to the king of Jericho. 
\p
\v 31 And Joshua and all Israel with him departed from Lebna to Lachis, and he encamped about it, and besieged it. 
\v 32 And the Lord delivered Lachis into the hands of Israel; and \f + \fr 10:32  \fqa Gr. \ft he, \fqa i. e. \ft Israel.\f*they took it on the second day, and they put the inhabitants to death with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed it, as they had done to Lebna. 
\v 33 Then Elam the king of Gazer went up to help Lachis; and Joshua smote him and his people with the edge of the sword, until there was not left to him one that was preserved and escaped. 
\p
\v 34 And Joshua and all Israel with him departed from Lachis to Odollam, and he besieged it and \f + \fr 10:34  \fqa Or, \ft vigourously attacked it.\f*took it. 
\v 35 And the Lord delivered it into the hand of Israel; and he took it on that day, and slew the inhabitants with the edge of the sword, and slew every thing breathing in it, as they did to Lachis. 
\p
\v 36 And Joshua and all Israel with him departed to Chebron, and encamped about it. 
\v 37 And he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the living creatures that were in it; there was no one preserved: they destroyed it and all things in it, as they did to Odollam. 
\p
\v 38 And Joshua and all Israel returned to Dabir; and they encamped about it; 
\v 39 and they took it, and its king, and its villages: and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and they destroyed it, and every thing breathing in it; and they did not leave in it any one that was preserved: as they did to Chebron and her king, so they did to Dabir and her king. 
\p
\v 40 And Joshua smote all the land of the hill country, and \f + \fr 10:40  \fqa Heb. \ft south.\f*Nageb and the plain country, and Asedoth, and her kings, they did not leave of them one that was saved: and they utterly destroyed every thing that had the breath of life, as the Lord God of Israel commanded, 
\v 41 from Cades Barne to Gaza, all Gosom, as far as Gabaon. 
\v 42 And Joshua smote, once for all, all their kings, and their land, because the Lord God of Israel fought on the side of Israel. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 And when Jabis the king of Asor heard, he sent to Jobab king of Maron, and to the king of Symoön, and to the king of Aziph, 
\v 2 and to the kings who were by the great Sidon, to the hill country and to Araba opposite Keneroth, and to the plain, and to Phenaeddor, 
\v 3 and to the Chananites on the coast eastward, and to the Amorites on the coast, and the Chettites, and the Pherezites, and the Jebusites in the mountain, and the Evites, and those dwelling under \add mount\add* Aermon in the land Massyma. 
\v 4 And they and their kings with them went forth, as the sand of the sea in multitude, and horses, and very many chariots. 
\v 5 And all the kings assembled in person, and came to the same place, and encamped at the waters of Maron to war with Israel. 
\p
\v 6 And the Lord said to Joshua, Be not afraid of them, for to-morrow \add at\add* this time I will put them to flight before Israel: thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their chariots with fire. 
\v 7 And Joshua and all the men of war came upon them \f + \fr 11:7  \fqa Gr. \ft to.\f*at the water of Maron suddenly; and they attacked them in the hill country. 
\v 8 And the Lord delivered them into the power of Israel; and they smote them and pursued them to great Sidon, and to Maseron, and to the plains of Massoch eastward; and they destroyed them till there was not one of them left that survived. 
\v 9 And Joshua did to them, as the Lord commanded him: he houghed their horses, and burned their chariots with fire. 
\p
\v 10 And Joshua returned at that time, and took Asor and her king; now Asor in former time was the chief of these kingdoms. 
\v 11 And they slew with the sword all that breathed in it, and utterly destroyed them all, and there was no living thing left in it; and they burnt Asor with fire. 
\v 12 And Joshua took all the cities of the kingdoms, and their kings, and slew them with the edge of the sword; and utterly slew them, as Moses the servant of the Lord commanded. 
\v 13 But all the walled cities Israel burnt not; but Israel burnt Asor only. 
\v 14 And the children of Israel took all its spoils to themselves; and they slew all the men with the edge of the sword, until he destroyed them; they left not one of them breathing. 
\v 15 As the Lord commanded his servant Moses, even so Moses commanded Joshua; and so Joshua did, he transgressed no precept of all that Moses commanded him. 
\p
\v 16 And Joshua took all the hill country, and all the land of Nageb, and all the land of Gosom, and the plain country, and that toward the west, and the mountain of Israel and the low country by the mountain; 
\v 17 from the mountain of Chelcha, and that which goes up to Seir, and as far as Balagad, and the plains of Libanus, under mount Aermon; and he took all their kings, and destroyed, and slew them. 
\v 18 And for many days Joshua waged war with these kings. 
\p
\v 19 And there was no city which Israel took not; they took all in war. 
\v 20 For it was of the Lord to \f + \fr 11:20  \fqa Gr. \ft strengthen.\f*harden their hearts to go forth to war against Israel, that they might be utterly destroyed, that mercy should not be granted to them, but that they should be utterly destroyed, as the Lord said to Moses. 
\p
\v 21 And Joshua came at that time, and utterly destroyed the Enakim out of the hill country, from Chebron and from Dabir, and from Anaboth, and from all the \f + \fr 11:21  \fqa Heb. \ft הר ישראל probably הר for דור a mountain, not a generation.\f*race of Israel, and from all the mountain of Juda with their cities; and Joshua utterly destroyed them. 
\v 22 There was not \add any one\add* left of the Enakim by the children of Israel, only there was left of them in Gaza, and in Gath, and in Aseldo. 
\p
\v 23 And Joshua took all the land, as the Lord commanded Moses; and Joshua gave them for an inheritance to Israel by division according to their tribes; and the land ceased from war. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 And these \add are\add* the kings of the land, whom the children of Israel slew, and inherited their land beyond Jordan from the east, from the valley of Arnon to the mount of Aermon, and all the land of Araba on the east. 
\v 2 Seon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Esebon, ruling from Arnon, which is in the valley, \f + \fr 12:2  \ft another reading is ἐπὶ τοῦ χείλους, on the slope \fqa or, \ft edge.\f*on the side of the valley, and half of Galaad as far as Jaboc, the borders of the children of Ammon. 
\v 3 And Araba as far as the sea of Chenereth eastward, and as far as the sea of Araba; the salt sea eastward \add by\add* the way to Asimoth, from Thæman under Asedoth Phasga. 
\v 4 And Og king of Basan, who dwelt in Astaroth and in Edrain, was left of the giants 
\v 5 ruling from mount Aermon and from Secchai, and \add over\add* all the land of Basan to the borders of Gergesi, and Machi, and the half of Galaad of the borders of Seon king of Esebon. 
\v 6 Moses the servant of the Lord and the children of Israel smote them; and Moses gave them by way of inheritance to Ruben, and Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasse. 
\p
\v 7 And these \add are\add* the kings of the Amorites, whom Joshua and the children of Israel slew beyond Jordan by the sea of Balagad in the plain of Libanus, and as far as the mountain of Chelcha, as men go up to Seir: and Joshua gave it to the tribes of Israel to inherit according to their portion; 
\v 8 in the mountain, and in the plain, and in Araba, and in Asedoth, and in the wilderness, and Nageb; the Chettite, and the Amorite, and the Chananite, and the Pherezite, and the Evite, and the Jebusite. 
\p
\v 9 The king of Jericho, and the king of Gai, which is near Bæthel; 
\v 10 the king of Jerusalem, the king of Chebron, 
\v 11 the king of Jerimuth, the king of Lachis; 
\v 12 the king of Ælam, the king of Gazer; 
\v 13 the king of Dabir, the king of Gader: 
\v 14 the king of Hermath, the king of Ader; 
\v 15 the king of Lebna, the king of Odollam, 
\v 16 the king of Elath, 
\v 17 the king of Taphut, the king of Opher, 
\v 18 the king of Ophec of Aroc, 
\v 19 the king of Asom, 
\v 20 the king of Symoön, the king of Mambroth, the king of Aziph, 
\v 21 the king of Cades, the king of Zachac, 
\v 22 the king of Maredoth, the king of Jecom of Chermel,

\v 24 the king of Thersa: all these \add were\add* twenty-nine kings. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 And Joshua \add was\add* old and very advanced in years; and the Lord said to Joshua, Thou art advanced in \f + \fr 13:1  \fqa Gr. \ft days.\f*years, and there is much land left to inherit. 
\v 2 And this \add is\add* the land that is left: the borders of the Phylistines, the Gesirite, and the Chananite, 
\v 3 from the \f + \fr 13:3  \fqa Gr. \ft uninhabited country.\f*wilderness before Egypt, as far as the borders of Accaron on the left of the Chananites \add the land\add* is reckoned to the five principalities of the Phylistines, to the inhabitant of Gaza, and of Azotus, and of Ascalon, and of Geth, and of Accaron, and to the Evite; 
\v 4 from Thæman even to all the land of Chanaan before Gaza, and the Sidonians as far as Aphec, as far as the borders of the Amorites. 
\v 5 And all the land of Galiath of the Phylistines, and all Libanus eastward from Galgal, under the mountain Aermon as far as the entering in of Emath; 
\v 6 every one that inhabits the hill country from Libanus as far as Masereth Memphomaim. All the Sidonians, I will destroy them from before Israel; but do thou give them by inheritance to Israel, as I charged thee. 
\p
\v 7 And now divide this land by lot to the nine tribes, and to the half tribe of Manasse. 
\v 8 From Jordan to the great sea westward thou shalt give it \add them\add*: the great sea shall be the boundary. \add But\add* to the two tribes and to the half tribe of Manasse, to Ruben and to Gad Moses gave \add an inheritance\add* beyond Jordan: Moses the servant of the Lord gave \add it\add* to \f + \fr 13:8  \fqa Gr. \ft him.\f*them eastward, 
\v 9 from Aroer, which is on the bank of the brook of Arnon, and the city in the midst of the valley, and all Misor from Mædaban. 
\v 10 All the cities of Seon king of the Amorites, who reigned from Esebon to the coasts of the children of Ammon; 
\v 11 and the region of Galaad, and the borders of the Gesirites and the Machatites, the whole mount of Aermon, and all the land of Basan to Acha. 
\v 12 All the kingdom of Og in the region of Basan, who reigned in Astaroth and in Edrain: he was left of the giants; and Moses smote him, and destroyed him. 
\v 13 But the children of Israel destroyed not the Gesirite and the Machatite and the Chananite; and the king of the Gesiri and the Machatite dwelt among the children of Israel until this day. 
\p
\v 14 Only no inheritance was given to the tribe of Levi: the Lord God of Israel, he \add is\add* their inheritance, as the Lord said to them; and this \add is\add* the division which Moses made to the children of Israel in Araboth Moab, on the other side of Jordan, by Jericho.

\v 2 They inherited according to their lots, as the Lord commanded by the hand of Joshua to the nine tribes and the half tribe, on the other side of Jordan. 
\v 3 But to the Levites he gave no inheritance among them. 
\v 4 For the sons of Joseph were two tribes, Manasse and Ephraim; and there was none inheritance in the land given to the Levites, only cities to dwell in, and their suburbs separated for the cattle, and their cattle. 
\v 5 As the Lord commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel; and they divided the land. 
\p
\v 6 And the children of Juda came to Joshua in Galgal, and Chaleb the \add son\add* of Jephone the Kenezite said to him, Thou knowest the word that the Lord spoke to Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Cades Barne. 
\v 7 For I was forty years old when Moses the servant of God sent me out of Cades Barne to spy out the land; and I returned him an answer according to his mind. 
\v 8 My brethren that went up with me turned away the heart of the people, but I \f + \fr 14:8  \fqa Or, \ft according to the \fqa Heb. \ft idiom, ‘fully followed.’\f*applied myself to follow the Lord my God. 
\v 9 And Moses sware on that day, saying, The land on which thou art gone up, it shall be thy inheritance and thy children's for ever, because thou hast applied thyself to follow the Lord our God. 
\v 10 And now the Lord has kept me alive as he said: this \add is\add* the forty-fifth year since the Lord spoke that word to Moses; and Israel journeyed in the wilderness; and now, behold, I \add am\add* this day eighty-five years old. 
\v 11 I am still strong this day, as when the Lord sent me: just so strong am I now to go out and to come in for war. 
\v 12 And now I ask of thee this mountain, as the Lord said in that day; for thou heardest this word on that day; and now the Enakim are there, cities great and strong: if then the Lord should be with me, I will utterly destroy them, as the Lord said to me. 
\p
\v 13 And Joshua blessed him, and gave Chebron to Chaleb the son of Jephone the son of Kenez for an inheritance. 
\v 14 Therefore Chebron became the inheritance of Chaleb the \add son\add* of Jephone the Kenezite until this day, because he followed the commandment of the Lord God of Israel.

\v 13 And to Chaleb the son of Jephone he gave a portion in the midst of the children of Juda by the command of God; and Joshua gave him the city of Arboc the metropolis of Enac; this is Chebron. 
\v 14 And Chaleb the son of Jephone destroyed thence the three sons of Enac, Susi, and Tholami, and Achima. 
\v 15 And Chaleb went up thence to the inhabitants of Dabir; and the name of Dabir before was \f + \fr 15:15  \fqa Heb. \ft Kirjath-sepher.\f*the city of Letters. 
\p
\v 16 And Chaleb said, Whosoever shall take and destroy the city of Letters, and master it, to him will I give my daughter Ascha to wife. 
\v 17 And Gothoniel the son of Chenez the brother of Chaleb took it; and he gave him Ascha his daughter to wife. 
\v 18 And it came to pass as she went out that she counselled him, saying, I will ask of my father a field; and she cried from off her ass; and Chaleb said to her, \f + \fr 15:18  \ft What has thou to say? \fqa or \ft of what hast thou need?\f*What is it? 
\v 19 And she said to him, Give me a blessing, for thou hast set me in the land of Nageb; give me Botthanis: and he gave her Gonæthla the upper, and Gonæthla the lower.

\v 36 and Armaith, and Arael, and Asor, 
\v 37 and Cades, and Assari, and the well of Asor; 
\v 38 and Keroe, and Megalaarim, and Bætthame, and Thessamys. 
\v 39 This \add is\add* the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Nephthali. 
\p
\v 40 And the seventh lot came out to Dan. 
\v 41 And their borders were Sarath, and Asa, and the cities of Sammaus, 
\v 42 and Salamin, and Ammon, and Silatha, 
\v 43 and Elon, and Thamnatha, and Accaron; 
\v 44 and Alcatha, and Begethon, and Gebeëlan, 
\v 45 and Azor, and Banæbacat, and Gethremmon. 
\v 46 And westward of Hieracon the border \add was\add* near to Joppa. 
\v 47 This \add is\add* the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan, according to their families, these \add are\add* their cities and their villages: 
\v 47a and the children of Dan did not drive out the Amorite who afflicted them in the mountain; and the Amorite would not suffer them to come down into the valley, but they forcibly took from them the border of their portion. 
\p
\v 48 And the sons of Dan went and fought against Lachis, and took it, and smote it with the \f + \fr 19:48  \fqa Gr. \ft mouth.\f*edge of the sword; and they dwelt in it, and called the name of it Lasendan: 
\v 48a and the Amorite continued to dwell in Edom and in Salamin: and the hand of Ephraim prevailed against them, and they became tributaries to them. 
\p
\v 49 And they proceeded to take possession of the land according to their borders, and the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Naue among them, 
\v 50 by the command of God, and they gave him the city which he asked for, Thamnasarach, which is in the mount of Ephraim; and he built the city, and dwelt in it. 
\p
\v 51 These \add are\add* the divisions which Eleazar the priest divided by lot, and Joshua the \add son\add* of Naue, and the heads of families among the tribes of Israel, according to the lots, in Selo before the Lord by the doors of the tabernacle of testimony, and they \f + \fr 19:51  \fqa Heb. \ft finished dividing.

\c 20  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spoke to Joshua, saying,

\v 7 And \f + \fr 20:7  \fqa Gr. \ft he.\f*Joshua separated Cades in Galilee in the mount \f + \fr 20:7  \fqa Or, \ft of N.\f*Nephthali, and Sychem in the mount Ephraim, and the city of Arboc; this is Chebron, in the mountain of Juda. 
\p
\v 8 And beyond Jordan he \f + \fr 20:8  \fqa Gr. \ft gave.\f*appointed Bosor in the wilderness in the plain out of the tribe of Ruben, and Aremoth in Galaad out of the tribe of Gad, and Gaulon in the country of Basan out of the tribe of Manasse. 
\p
\v 9 These \add were\add* the cities selected for the sons of Israel, and for the stranger abiding among them, that every one who smites a soul unintentionally should flee thither, that he should not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he should stand before the congregation for judgment. 
\c 21  
\p
\v 1 And the heads of the families of the sons of Levi drew near to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the \add son\add* of Naue, and to the heads of families of the tribes of Israel. 
\v 2 And they spoke to them in Selo in the land of Chanaan, saying, The Lord gave commandment by \f + \fr 21:2  \fqa Gr. \ft the hand of Moses.\f*Moses to give us cities to dwell in, and the country round about for our cattle. 
\v 3 So the children of Israel gave to the Levites in their inheritance by the command of the Lord the cities and the country round. 
\p
\v 4 And the lot came out for the children of Caath; and the sons of Aaron, the priests the Levites, had by lot thirteen cities \f + \fr 21:4  \fqa Gr. \ft from.\f*out of the tribe of Juda, and out of the tribe of Symeon, and out of the tribe of Benjamin.

\v 6 And the sons of Gedson had thirteen cities, out of the tribe of Issachar, and out of the tribe of Aser, and out of the tribe of Nephthali, and out of the half tribe of Manasse in \f + \fr 21:6  \fqa Or, \ft the land of Basan.\f*Basan. 
\p
\v 7 And the sons of Merari according to their families had by lot twelve cities, out of the tribe of Ruben, and out of the tribe of Gad, and out of the tribe of Zabulon. 
\p
\v 8 And the children of Israel gave to the Levites the cities and their suburbs, as the Lord commanded Moses, by lot. 
\p
\v 9 And the tribe of the children of Juda, and the tribe of the children of Symeon, and \add part\add* of the tribe of the children of Benjamin gave these cities, and they were assigned

\v 12 But the lands of the city, and its villages Joshua gave to the sons of Chaleb the son of Jephonne for a possession. 
\p
\v 13 And to the sons of Aaron he gave the city of refuge for the slayer, Chebron, and the \f + \fr 21:13  \ft The Greek word is different from that translated ‘suburbs.’ above.—\fqa q. d. \ft glebe.\f*suburbs belonging to it; and Lemna and the suburbs belonging to it;

\v 17 And from the tribe of Benjamin, Gabaon and its suburbs; and Gatheth and its suburbs; 
\v 18 and Anathoth and its suburbs; and Gamala and its suburbs; four cities. 
\v 19 All the cities of the sons of Aaron the priests, thirteen.

\v 20 And to the families, \add even\add* the sons of Caath the Levites, that were left of the sons of Caath, there was \add given\add* \f + \fr 21:20  \fqa Heb. \ft the cities of their lot.\f*their priests' city,

\v 23 and of the tribe of Dan, Helcothaim and its suburbs; and Gethedan and its suburbs: 
\v 24 and Ælon and its suburbs; and Getheremmon and its suburbs: four cities. 
\v 25 And out of the half tribe of Manasse, Tanach and its suburbs; and Jebatha and its suburbs; two cities. 
\v 26 In all \add were given\add* ten cities, and the suburbs of each belonging to them, to the families of the sons of Caath that remained. 
\p
\v 27 And \add Joshua gave\add* to the sons of Gedson the Levites out of the other half tribe of Manasse cities set apart for the slayers, Gaulon in the country of Basan, and its suburbs; and Bosora and its suburbs; two cities.

\v 30 And out of the tribe of Aser, Basella and its suburbs; and Dabbon and its suburbs;

\v 32 And of the tribe of Nephthali, the city set apart for the slayer, Cades in Galilee, and its suburbs; and Nemmath, and its suburbs; and Themmon and its suburbs; three cities. 
\v 33 All the cities of Gedson according to their families \add were\add* thirteen cities. 
\p
\v 34 And to the family of the sons of Merari the Levites that remained, \add he gave\add* out of the tribe of Zabulon, Maan and its suburbs; and Cades and its suburbs,

\v 36 And beyond Jordan over against Jericho, out of the tribe of Ruben, the city of refuge for the slayer, Bosor in the wilderness; Miso and its suburbs; and Jazer and its suburbs; 
\v 37 and Decmon and its suburbs; and Mapha and its suburbs; four cities. 
\v 38 And out of the tribe of Gad the city of refuge for the slayer, both Ramoth in Galaad, and its suburbs; Camin and its suburbs;

\v 40 All \add these\add* cities \add were given\add* to the sons of Merari according to the families of them that were left out of the tribe of Levi; and \f + \fr 21:40  \fqa i. e. \ft the portion allotted, or assigned them.\f*their limits were the twelve cities. 
\p
\v 41 All the cities of the Levites in the midst of the possession of the children of Israel, \add were\add* forty-eight cities, 
\v 42 and their suburbs round about these cities: a city and the suburbs round about the city to all these cities: 
\v 42a and Joshua ceased dividing the land by their borders: 
\v 42b and the children of Israel gave a portion to Joshua because of the commandment of the Lord: they gave him the city which he asked: they gave him Thamnasachar in mount Ephraim; 
\v 42c and Joshua built the city, and dwelt in it: 
\v 42d and Joshua took the knives of stone, wherewith he circumcised the children of Israel that were born in the desert by the way, and put them in Thamnasachar. 
\p
\v 43 So the Lord gave to Israel all the land which he sware to give to their fathers: and they inherited it, and dwelt in it. 
\v 44 And the Lord gave them rest round about, as he sware to their fathers: not one of all their enemies maintained his ground against them; the Lord delivered all their enemies into their hands. 
\v 45 There failed not one of the good things which the Lord spoke to the children of Israel; all came to pass. 
\c 22  
\p
\v 1 Then Joshua called together the sons of Ruben, and the sons of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse, 
\v 2 and said to them, Ye have heard all that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you, and ye have hearkened to my voice in all that he commanded you. 
\v 3 Ye have not deserted your brethren these many days: until this day ye have kept the commandment of the Lord your God. 
\v 4 And now the Lord our God has given our brethren rest, as he told them: now then return and depart to your homes, and to the land of your possession, which Moses gave you on the other side Jordan. 
\v 5 But take great heed to do the commands and the law, which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you to do; to love the Lord our God, to walk in all his ways, to keep his commands, and to cleave to him, and serve him with all your mind, and with all your soul. 
\v 6 And Joshua blessed them, and dismissed them; and they went to their homes. 
\p
\v 7 And to \add one\add* half the tribe of Manasse Moses gave a portion in the land of Basan, and to \add the other\add* half Joshua gave a portion with his brethren on the other side of Jordan westward: and when Joshua sent them away to their homes, then he blessed them. 
\v 8 And they departed with much wealth to their houses, and they divided the spoil of their enemies with their brethren; very much cattle, and silver, and gold, and iron, and much raiment. 
\p
\v 9 So the sons of Ruben, and the sons of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse, departed from the children of Israel in Selo in the land of Chanaan, to go away into Galaad, into the land of their possession, which they inherited by the command of the Lord, by the hand of Moses. 
\p
\v 10 And they came to Galaad of Jordan, which is in the land of Chanaan: and the children of Ruben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse built there an altar by Jordan, a great altar to look at. 
\p
\v 11 And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the sons of Ruben, and the sons of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse have built an altar at the borders of the land of Chanaan at Galaad of Jordan, on the opposite side to the children of Israel. 
\v 12 And all the children of Israel gathered together to Selo, so as to go up and fight against them. 
\p
\v 13 And the children of Israel sent to the sons of Ruben, and the sons of Gad, and to the sons of the half tribe of Manasse into the land of Galaad, both Phinees the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, 
\v 14 and ten of the chiefs with him; \add there was\add* one chief of every household out of all the tribes of Israel; (the heads of families are the captains of thousands in Israel.) 
\v 15 And they came to the sons of Ruben, and to the sons of Gad, and to the \f + \fr 22:15  \fqa Gr. \ft halves, \fqa adj. q. d. \ft dimidios \fqa viros.\f*half tribe of Manasse into the land of Galaad; and they spoke to them, saying, 
\v 16 Thus says the whole congregation of the Lord, What \add is\add* this transgression that ye have transgressed before the God of Israel, to turn away today from the Lord, in that ye have built for yourselves an altar, so that ye should be apostates from the Lord? 
\v 17 Is the sin of Phogor too little for you, whereas we have not been cleansed from it until this day, though there was a plague among the congregation of the Lord? 
\v 18 And ye have this day revolted from the Lord; and it shall come to pass if ye revolt this day from the Lord, that to-morrow there shall be wrath upon all Israel. 
\v 19 And now if the land of your possession \add be too\add* little, cross over to the land of the possession of the Lord, where the tabernacle of the Lord dwells, and receive ye an inheritance among us; and do not become apostates from God, neither do ye apostatize from the Lord, because of your having built an altar apart from the altar of the Lord our God. 
\v 20 Lo! did not Achar the \add son\add* of Zara commit a trespass \add taking\add* of the accursed thing, and there was wrath on the whole congregation of Israel? and he himself died alone in his own sin. 
\p
\v 21 And the sons of Ruben, and the sons of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse answered, and spoke to the captains of the thousands of Israel, saying, 
\v 22 God \add even\add* God is the Lord, and God \add even\add* God himself knows, and Israel he shall know; if we have transgressed before the Lord by apostasy, let him not deliver us this day. 
\v 23 And if we have built to ourselves an altar, so as to apostatize from the Lord our God, so as to offer upon it a sacrifice of whole-burnt-offerings, so as to offer upon it a sacrifice of peace-offering,—the Lord shall require it. 
\p
\v 24 But we have done this for the sake of precaution \add concerning this\add* thing, saying, Lest \f + \fr 22:24  \fqa Gr. \ft to-morrow.\f*hereafter your sons should say to our sons, What have ye to do with the Lord God of Israel? 
\v 25 Whereas the Lord has set boundaries between us and you, even Jordan, and ye have no portion \f + \fr 22:25  \fqa Gr. \ft of.\f*in the Lord: so your sons shall alienate our sons, that they should not worship the Lord. 
\v 26 And we \f + \fr 22:26  \fqa Gr. \ft spoke.\f*gave orders to do thus, to build this altar, not for burnt-offerings, nor for meat-offerings; 
\v 27 but that this may be a witness between you and us, and between our posterity after us, that we may do service to the Lord before him, with our burnt-offerings and our meat-offerings and our peace-offerings: so your sons shall not say to our sons, \f + \fr 22:27  \fqa Gr. \ft to-morrow.\f*hereafter, Ye have no portion \f + \fr 22:27  \fqa Gr. \ft of.\f*in the Lord. 
\v 28 And we said, If ever it should come to pass that they should speak \add so\add* to us, or to our posterity hereafter; then shall they say, Behold the likeness of the altar of the Lord, which our fathers made, not for the sake of burnt-offerings, nor for the sake of meat-offerings, but it is a witness between you and us, and between our sons. 
\v 29 Far be it from us therefore that we should turn away from the Lord this day so as to apostatize from the Lord, so as that we should build an altar for burnt-offerings, and for \f + \fr 22:29  \ft A double translation in Greek.\f*peace-offerings, besides the altar of the Lord which is before his tabernacle. 
\p
\v 30 And Phinees the priest and all the chiefs of the congregation of Israel who were with him \f + \fr 22:30  \fqa Gr. \ft having heard.\f*heard the words which the children of Ruben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse spoke; and it pleased them. 
\v 31 And Phinees the priest said to the sons of Ruben, and to the sons of Gad, and to the half of the tribe of Manasse, To-day we know that the Lord \add is\add* with us, because ye have not trespassed grievously against the Lord, and because ye have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the Lord. 
\v 32 So Phinees the priest and the princes departed from the children of Ruben, and from the children of Gad, and from the half tribe of Manasse out of Galaad into the land of Chanaan to the children of Israel; and reported the words to them. 
\v 33 And it pleased the children of Israel; and they spoke to the children of Israel, and blessed the God of the children of Israel, and told them to go up no more to war against \f + \fr 22:33  \fqa Gr. \ft them.\f*the others to destroy the land of the children of Ruben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse: so they dwelt upon it. 
\p
\v 34 And Joshua gave a name to the altar of the children of Ruben, and the children of Gad, and of the half tribe of Manasse; and said, It is a testimony in the midst of them, that the Lord is their God. 
\c 23  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass after many days after the Lord had given Israel rest from all his enemies round about, that Joshua was old and advanced in \f + \fr 23:1  \fqa Gr. \ft days.\f*years. 
\v 2 And Joshua called together all the children of Israel, and their elders, and their chiefs, and their judges, and their officers; and said to them, I am old and advanced in years. 
\v 3 And ye have seen all that the Lord our God has done to all these nations before us; for \add it is\add* the Lord our God who has fought for you. 
\v 4 See, that I have \f + \fr 23:4  \fqa Gr. \ft cast upon you.\f*given to you these nations that are left to you by lots to your tribes, all the nations beginning at Jordan; and \add some\add* I have destroyed; and \f + \fr 23:4  \fqa Gr. \ft he shall bound.\f*the boundaries shall be at the great sea westward. 
\p
\v 5 And the Lord our God, he shall destroy them before us, until they utterly perish; and he shall send against them the wild beasts, until he shall have utterly destroyed them and their kings from before you; and ye shall inherit their land, as the Lord our God said to you. 
\v 6 Do ye therefore strive diligently to observe and do all things written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not to the right hand or to the left; 
\v 7 that ye go not in among these nations that are left; and the names of their gods shall not be named among you, neither shall ye serve them, neither shall ye bow down to them. 
\v 8 But ye shall cleave to the Lord our God, as ye have done until this day. 
\v 9 And the Lord shall destroy them before you, \add even\add* great and strong nations; and no one has stood before us until this day. 
\v 10 One of you has chased a thousand, for the Lord our God, he fought for you, as he said to you. 
\p
\v 11 And take ye great heed to love the Lord our God. 
\v 12 For if ye shall turn aside and attach yourselves to these nations that are left with you, and make marriages with them, and become mingled with them and they with you, 
\v 13 know that the Lord will no more destroy these nations from before you; and they will be to you snares and stumbling-blocks, and nails in your heels, and darts in your eyes, until ye be destroyed from off this good land, which the Lord your God has given you. 
\p
\v 14 But I hasten to go the way \add of death\add*, as all that are upon the earth also \add do\add*: and know ye in your heart and in your soul, that not one word has fallen \add to the ground\add* of all the words which the Lord our God has spoken respecting all that concerns us; there has not one of them failed. 
\v 15 And it shall come to pass, that as all the good things are come upon us which the Lord spoke concerning you, so the Lord God will bring upon you all the evil things, until he shall have destroyed you from off this good land, which the Lord has given you, 
\v 16 when ye transgress the covenant of the Lord our God, which he has charged us, and go and serve other gods, and bow down to them. 
\c 24  
\p
\v 1 And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Selo, and convoked their elders, and their officers, and their judges, and set them before God. 
\p
\v 2 And Joshua said to all the people, Thus says the Lord God of Israel, Your fathers at first sojourned beyond the river, \add even\add* Thara, the father of Abraam and the father of Nachor; and they served other gods. 
\v 3 And I took your father Abraam from the other side of the river, and I guided him \f + \fr 24:3  \fqa Gr. \ft in.\f*through all the land, and I multiplied his seed; 
\v 4 and I gave to him Isaac, and to Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave to Esau mount Seir for him to inherit: and Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt, and became there a great and populous and mighty nation: and the Egyptians afflicted them. 
\v 5 And I smote Egypt with the wonders that I wrought among them. 
\v 6 And afterwards \add God\add* brought out our fathers from Egypt, and ye entered into the Red Sea; and the Egyptians pursued after our fathers with chariots and horses into the Red Sea. 
\v 7 And we cried aloud to the Lord; and he \f + \fr 24:7  \fqa Gr. \ft gave.\f*put a cloud and darkness between us and the Egyptians, and he brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen all that the Lord did in the land of Egypt; and ye were in the wilderness many days. 
\p
\v 8 And he brought us into the land of the Amorites that dwelt beyond Jordan, and the Lord delivered them into our hands; and ye inherited their land, and utterly destroyed them from before you. 
\p
\v 9 And Balac, king of Moab, son of Sepphor, rose up, and \f + \fr 24:9  \fqa Gr. \ft set himself in array.\f*made war against Israel, and sent and called Balaam to curse us. 
\v 10 But the Lord thy God would not destroy thee; and he greatly blessed us, and rescued us out of their hands, and delivered them \add to us\add*. 
\v 11 And ye crossed over Jordan, and came to Jericho; and the inhabitants of Jericho fought against us, the Amorite, and the Chananite, and the Pherezite, and the Evite, and the Jebusite, and the Chettite, and the Gergesite, and the Lord delivered them into our hands. 
\v 12 And he sent forth the hornet before you; and he drove them out from before you, \add even\add* twelve kings of the Amorites, not with thy sword, nor with thy bow. 
\p
\v 13 And he gave you a land on which ye did not labour, and cities which ye did not build, and ye were settled in them; and ye \f + \fr 24:13  \fqa Or, \ft shall eat.\f*eat \add of\add* vineyards and oliveyards which ye did not plant. 
\p
\v 14 And now fear the Lord, and serve him in righteousness and justice; and remove the strange gods, which our fathers served beyond the river, and in Egypt; and serve the Lord. 
\v 15 But if it seem not good to you to serve the Lord, choose to yourselves this day whom ye will serve, whether the gods of your fathers that were on the other side of the river, or the gods of the Amorites, among whom ye dwell upon their land: but I and my house will serve the Lord, for he is holy. 
\p
\v 16 And the people answered and said, Far be it from us to forsake the Lord, so as to serve other gods. 
\v 17 The Lord our God, he is God; he brought up us and our fathers from Egypt, and kept us in all the way wherein we walked, and among all the nations \f + \fr 24:17  \fqa Gr. \ft whom we passed through them. \fqa Hebraism \ft See \xt Mark 1. 7; Luke 3. 16; 1 Pet. 2. 24.\f*through whom we passed. 
\v 18 And the Lord cast out the Amorite, and all the nations that inhabited the land from before us: yea, we will serve the Lord, for he is our God. 
\p
\v 19 And Joshua said to the people, Indeed ye will not be able to serve the Lord, for God is holy; and he being jealous will not forgive your sins and your transgressions. 
\v 20 Whensoever ye shall forsake the Lord and serve other gods, then he shall come upon you and afflict you, and consume you, \f + \fr 24:20  \fqa Or, \ft whereas on the contrary.\f*because he has done you good. 
\v 21 And the people said to Joshua, Nay, but we will serve the Lord. 
\p
\v 22 And Joshua said to the people, Ye \add are\add* witnesses against yourselves, that ye have chosen the Lord to serve him. 
\v 23 And now take away the strange gods that are among you, and set your heart right toward the Lord God of Israel. 
\v 24 And the people said to Joshua, We will serve the Lord, and we will hearken to his voice. 
\p
\v 25 So Joshua made a covenant with the people on that day, and gave them a law and an ordinance in Selo before the tabernacle of the God of Israel. 
\v 26 And he wrote these words in the book of the laws of God: and Joshua took a great stone, and set it up under the \f + \fr 24:26  \fqa Gr. \ft Properly a pine or turpentine tree. So chap. \xt 17. 9.\f*oak before the Lord. 
\v 27 And Joshua said to the people, Behold, this stone shall be among you for a witness, for it has heard all the words that have been spoken to it by the Lord; for he has spoken to you this day; and this \add stone\add* shall be among you for a witness in the last days, whenever ye shall deal falsely with the Lord my God. 
\v 28 And Joshua dismissed the people, and they went every man to his place. 
\v 29 And Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that \f + \fr 24:29  \fqa Gr. \ft drew out the time with Joshua. \fqa Hebraism.\f*lived as long as Joshua, and all that knew all the works of the Lord which he wrought for Israel. 
\p
\v 30 And it came to pass after these things that Joshua the son of Naue the servant of the Lord died, \add at the age\add* of a hundred and ten years. 
\v 31 And they buried him by the borders of his inheritance in Thamnasarach in the mount of Ephraim, northward of the mount of Galaad:

\v 32 And the children of Israel brought up the bones of Joseph out of Egypt, and buried \add them\add* in Sicima, in the portion of the land which Jacob bought of the Amorites who dwelt in Sicima for a hundred ewe-lambs; and he gave it to Joseph for a portion.
