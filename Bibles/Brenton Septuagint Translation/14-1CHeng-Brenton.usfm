\p
\v 1 Now the Philistines warred against Israel; and they fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gelbue. 
\v 2 And the Philistines pursued after Saul, and after his sons; and the Philistines smote Jonathan, and Aminadab, and Melchisue, sons of Saul. 
\v 3 And the battle prevailed against Saul, and the archers hit him with bows and arrows, and they were wounded of the bows. 
\v 4 And Saul said to his armour-bearer, Draw thy sword, and pierce me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and mock me. But his armour-bearer would not, for he was greatly afraid: so Saul took a sword, and fell upon it. 
\v 5 And his armour-bearer saw that Saul was dead, and he also fell upon his sword. 
\v 6 So Saul died, and his three sons on that day, and all his family died at the same time. 
\v 7 And all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw that Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, and they left their cities, and fled: and the Philistines came and dwelt in them. 
\p
\v 8 And it came to pass on the next \add day\add* that the Philistines came to strip the slain, and they found Saul and his sons fallen on mount Gelbue. 
\v 9 And they stripped him, and took his head, and his armour, and sent them into the land of the Philistines round about, to proclaim the glad tidings to their idols, and to the people. 
\v 10 And they put their armour in the house of their god, and they put his head in the house of Dagon. 
\p
\v 11 And all the dwellers in Galaad heard of all that the Philistines had done to Saul and to Israel. 
\v 12 And all the mighty men rose up from Galaad, and they took the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabis, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabis, and fasted seven days. 
\v 13 So Saul died for his transgressions, wherein he transgressed against God, against the word of the Lord, forasmuch as he kept \add it\add* not, because Saul enquired of a wizard to seek \add counsel\add*, and Samuel the prophet answered him: 
\v 14 and he sought not the Lord: so he slew him, and turned the kingdom to David the son of Jesse. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 And all Israel came to David in Chebron, saying, Behold, we \add are\add* thy bones and thy flesh. 
\v 2 And heretofore when Saul was king, thou wast he that led Israel in and out, and the Lord of Israel said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be for a ruler over Israel. 
\v 3 And all the elders of Israel came to the king to Chebron; and king David made a covenant with them in Chebron before the Lord: and they anointed David to be king over Israel, according to the word of the Lord by Samuel. 
\p
\v 4 And the king and his men went to Jerusalem, this \add is\add* Jebus; and there the Jebusites the inhabitants of the land said to David, 
\v 5 Thou shalt not enter in hither. But he took the strong hold of Sion: this \add is\add* the city of David. 
\v 6 And David said, Whoever first smites the Jebusite, even he shall be chief and captain. And Joab the son of Saruia went up first, and became chief. 
\v 7 And David dwelt in the strong hold; therefore he called it the city of David. 
\v 8 And he fortified the city round about. 
\v 9 And David continued to increase, and the Lord Almighty \add was\add* with him. 
\v 10 And these \add are\add* the chiefs of the mighty men, whom David had, who strengthened \add themselves\add* with him in his kingdom, with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the Lord concerning Israel. 
\p
\v 11 And this \add is\add* the list of the mighty \add men\add* of David; Jesebada, son of Achaman, first of the thirty: he drew his sword once against three hundred whom he slew at one time. 
\v 12 And after him Eleazar son of Dodai, the Achochite: he was among the three mighty men. 
\v 13 He was with David in Phasodamin, and the Philistines were gathered there to battle, and \add there was\add* a portion of the field full of barley; and the people fled before the Philistines. 
\v 14 And he stood in the midst of the portion, and rescued it, and smote the Philistines; and the Lord wrought a great deliverance. 
\p
\v 15 And three of the thirty chiefs went down to the rock to David, to the cave of Odollam, and the camp of the Philistines \add was\add* in the giants' valley. 
\v 16 And David \add was\add* then in the hold, and the garrison of the Philistines \add was\add* then in Bethleem. 
\v 17 And David longed, and said, Who will give me water to drink of the well of Bethleem, that is in the gate? 
\v 18 And the three broke through the camp of the Philistines, and they drew water out of the well that was in Bethleem, which was in the gate, and they took it, and came to David: but David would not drink it, and poured it out to the Lord, and said, 
\v 19 God forbid that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men with their lives? for with \add the peril of\add* their lives they brought it. So he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty \add men\add*. 
\p
\v 20 And Abisa the brother of Joab, he was chief of three: he drew his sword against three hundred slain at one time, and he had a name among the \add second\add* three. 
\v 21 He was more famous than the two \add others\add* of the three, and he was chief \add over\add* them; yet he reached not to the \add first\add* three. 
\p
\v 22 And Banaia the son of Jodae was the son of a mighty man: many \add were\add* his acts for Cabasael: he smote two lion-like men of Moab, and he went down and smote a lion in a pit on a snowy day. 
\v 23 And he smote an Egyptian, a wonderful man five cubits \add high\add*; and in the hand of the Egyptian \add there was\add* a spear like a weavers' beam; and Banaia went down to him with a staff, and took the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear. 
\v 24 These things did Banaia son of Jodae, and his name \add was\add* among the three mighties. 
\v 25 He was distinguished beyond the thirty, yet he reached not to the \add first\add* three: and David set him over his family. 
\p
\v 26 And the mighty \add men\add* of the forces \add were\add*, Asael the brother of Joab, Eleanan the son of Dodoe of Bethleem, 
\v 27 Samaoth the Arorite, Chelles the Phelonite, 
\v 28 Ora the son of Ekkis the Thecoite, Abiezer the Anathothite, 
\v 29 Sobochai the Usathite, Eli the Achonite, 
\v 30 Marai the Netophathite, Chthaod the son of Nooza the Netophathite, 
\v 31 Airi the son of Rebie of the hill of Benjamin, Banaias the Pharathonite, 
\v 32 Uri of Nachali Gaas, Abiel the Garabæthite, 
\v 33 Azbon the Baromite, Eliaba the Salabonite, 
\v 34 the son of Asam the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Sola the Ararite, 
\v 35 Achim the son of Achar the Ararite, Elphat the son of Thyrophar 
\v 36 the Mechorathrite, Achia the Phellonite, 
\v 37 Esere the Charmadaite, Naarai the son of Azobai, 
\v 38 Joel the son of Nathan, Mebaal son of Agari, 
\v 39 Sele the son of Ammoni, Nachor the Berothite, armour-bearer to the son of Saruia, 
\v 40 Ira the Jethrite, Gaber the Jethrite, 
\v 41 Uria the Chettite, Zabet son of Achaia, 
\v 42 Adina son of Sæza, a chief of Ruben, and thirty with him, 
\v 43 Anan the son of Moöcha, and Josaphat the Matthanite, 
\v 44 Ozia the Astarothite, Samatha and Jeiel sons of Chotham the Ararite, 
\v 45 Jediel the son of Sameri, and Jozae his brother the Thosaite, 
\v 46 Eliel the Maoite, and Jaribi, and Josia his son, Ellaam, and Jethama the Moabite, 
\v 47 Daliel, and Obeth, and Jessiel of Mesobia. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 And these \add are\add* they that came to Sikelag, when he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kis; and these \add were\add* among the mighty, aiding \add him\add* in war, 
\v 2 and \add using\add* the bow with the right hand and with the left, and slingers with stones, and \add shooters\add* with bows. Of the brethren of Saul of Benjamin, 
\v 3 the chief \add was\add* Achiezer, and Joas son of Asma the Gabathite, and Joel and Jophalet, sons of Asmoth, and Berchia, and Jeul of Anathoth, 
\v 4 and Samaias the Gabaonite a mighty man among the thirty, and over the thirty; 
\v 5  \add and\add* Jeremia, and Jeziel, and Joanan, and Jozabath of Gadarathiim, 
\v 6 Azai and Arimuth, and Baalia, and Samaraia, and Saphatias of Charæphiel, 
\v 7 Helcana, and Jesuni, and Ozriel, and Jozara, and Sobocam, and the Corites, 
\v 8 and Jelia and Zabadia, sons of Iroam, and the \add men\add* of Gedor. 
\p
\v 9 And from Gad these separated themselves to David from the wilderness, strong mighty men of war, bearing shields and spears, and their faces \add were as\add* the face of a lion, and they were nimble as roes upon the mountains in speed. 
\v 10 Aza the chief, Abdia the second, Eliab the third, 
\v 11 Masmana the fourth, Jeremias the fifth, 
\v 12 Jethi the sixth, Eliab the seventh, 
\v 13 Joanan the eighth, Eleazer the ninth, 
\v 14 Jeremia the tenth, Melchabanai the eleventh. 
\v 15 These \add were\add* chiefs of the army of the sons of Gad, the least one commander of a hundred, and the greatest one of a thousand. 
\v 16 These \add are\add* the \add men\add* that crossed over Jordan in the first month, and it had overflowed all its banks; and they drove out all the inhabitants of the valleys, from the east to the west. 
\p
\v 17 And there came \add some\add* of the sons of Benjamin and Juda to the assistance of David. 
\v 18 And David went out to meet them, and said to them, If ye are come peaceably to me, let my heart be at peace with you: but if \add ye are come\add* to betray me to my enemies unfaithfully, the God of your fathers look upon it, and reprove it. 
\v 19 And the Spirit came upon Amasai, a captain of the thirty, and he said, Go, David, son of Jesse, thou and thy people, peace, peace be to thee, and peace to thy helpers, for thy God has helped thee. And David received them, and made them captains of the forces. 
\p
\v 20 And \add some\add* came to David from Manasse, when the Philistines came against Saul to war: and he helped them not, because the captains of the Philistines took counsel, saying, With the heads of those men will he return to his master Saul. 
\v 21 When David was going to Sikelag, there came to him of Manasse, Edna and Jozabath, and Rodiel, and Michael, and Josabaith, and Elimuth, and Semathi: \add these\add* are the captains of thousands of Manasse. 
\v 22 And they fought on the side of David against a troop, for they \add were\add* all men of might; and they were commanders in the army, \add because\add* of \add their\add* might. 
\v 23 For daily men came to David, \add till they amounted\add* to a great force, as the force of God. 
\p
\v 24 And these \add are\add* the names of the commanders of the army, who came to David to Chebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him according to the word of the Lord. 
\v 25 The sons of Juda, bearing shields and spears, six thousand and eight hundred mighty in war. 
\v 26 Of the sons of Symeon mighty for battle, seven thousand and a hundred. 
\v 27 Of the sons of Levi, four thousand and six hundred. 
\v 28 And Joadas the chief \add of the family\add* of Aaron, and with him three thousand and seven hundred. 
\v 29 And Sadoc, a young \add man\add* mighty in strength, and \add there were\add* twenty-two leaders of his father's house. 
\v 30 And of the sons of Benjamin, the brethren of Saul, three thousand: and still the greater part of them kept the guard of the house of Saul. 
\v 31 And of the sons of Ephraim, twenty thousand and eight hundred mighty men, famous in the houses of their fathers. 
\v 32 And of the half-tribe of Manasse, eighteen thousand, even \add those\add* who were named by name, to make David king. 
\v 33 And of the sons of Issachar having wisdom with regard to the times, knowing what Israel should do, two hundred; and all their brethren with them. 
\p
\v 34 And of Zabulon they that went out to battle, with all weapons of war, \add were\add* fifty thousand to help David, not weak-handed. 
\v 35 And of Nephthali a thousand captains, and with them \add men\add* with shields and spears, thirty-seven thousand. 
\v 36 And of the Danites \add men\add* ready for war twenty-eight thousand and eight hundred. 
\v 37 And of Aser, they that went out to give aid in war, forty thousand. 
\v 38 And from the country beyond Jordan, from Ruben, and the Gadites, and from the half-tribe of Manasse, a hundred and twenty thousand, with all weapons of war. 
\p
\v 39 All these \add were\add* men of war, setting \add the army\add* in battle array, with a peaceful mind \add towards him\add*, and they came to Chebron to make David king over all Israel: and the rest of Israel \add were of\add* one mind to make David king. 
\v 40 And they were there three days eating and drinking, for their brethren \add had\add* made preparations. 
\v 41 And their neighbours, as far as Issachar and Zabulon and Nephthali, brought to them upon camels, and asses, and mules, and upon calves, victuals, meal, cakes of figs, raisins, wine, and oil, calves and sheep abundantly: for \add there was\add* joy in Israel. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 And David took counsel with the captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, \add even with\add* every commander. 
\v 2 And David said to the whole congregation of Israel, If it \add seem\add* good to you, and it should be prospered by the Lord our God, let us send to our brethren that are left in all the land of Israel, and let the priests the Levites who are with them in the cities of their possession \add come\add*, and let them be gathered to us. 
\v 3 And let us bring over to us the ark of our God; for men have not enquired \add at\add* it since the days of Saul. 
\v 4 And all the congregation said that they would do thus; for the saying was right in the eyes of all the people. 
\p
\v 5 So David assembled all Israel, from the borders of Egypt even to the entering in of Hemath, to bring in the ark of God from the city of Jarim. 
\v 6 And David brought it up: and all Israel went up to the city of David, which belonged to Juda, to bring up thence the ark of the Lord God who sits between the cherubim, whose name is called \add on it\add*. 
\v 7 And they set the ark of God on a new waggon \add brought\add* out of the house of Aminadab: and Oza and his brethren drove the waggon. 
\p
\v 8 And David and all Israel \add were\add* playing before the Lord with all their might, and \add that\add* together with singers, and with harps, and with lutes, with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets. 
\v 9 And they came as far as the threshing-floor: and Oza put forth his hand to hold the ark, because the bullock moved it from \add its place\add*. 
\v 10 And the Lord was very angry with Oza, and smote him there, because of his stretching forth his hand upon the ark: and he died there before God. 
\v 11 And David was dispirited, because the Lord \add had\add* made a breach on Oza: and he called that place the Breach of Oza until this day. 
\v 12 And David feared God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God in to myself? 
\v 13 So David brought not the ark home to himself into the city of David, but he turned it aside into the house of Abeddara the Gethite. 
\p
\v 14 And the ark of God abode in the house of Abeddara three months: and God blessed Abeddara and all that he had. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1 And Chiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar timbers, and masons, and carpenters, to build a house for him. 
\v 2 And David knew that the Lord \add had\add* designed him to be king over Israel; because his kingdom was highly exalted, on account of his people Israel. 
\p
\v 3 And David took more wives in Jerusalem: and there were born to David more sons and daughters. 
\v 4 And these \add are\add* the names of those that were born, who were \add born\add* to him in Jerusalem; Samaa, Sobab, Nathan, and Solomon, 
\v 5 and Baar, and Elisa, and Eliphaleth, 
\v 6 and Nageth, and Naphath, and Japhie, 
\v 7 and Elisamae, and Eliade, and Eliphala. 
\p
\v 8 And the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel: and all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard \add it\add*, and went out to meet them. 
\v 9 And the Philistines came and assembled together in the giants' valley. 
\v 10 And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into my hand? And the Lord said to him, Go up, and I will deliver them into thy hands. 
\v 11 And he went up to Baal Pharasin, and David smote them there; and David said, God has broken through enemies by my hand like a breach of water: therefore he called the name of that place, the Breach of Pharasin. 
\v 12 And the Philistines left their gods there; and David gave orders to burn them with fire. 
\p
\v 13 And the Philistines once more assembled themselves in the giants' valley. 
\v 14 And David enquired of God again; and God said to him, Thou shalt not go after them; turn away from them, and thou shalt come upon them near the pear trees. 
\v 15 And it shall be, when thou shalt hear the sound of their tumult in the tops of the pear trees, then thou shalt go into the battle: for God has gone out before thee to smite the army of the Philistines. 
\v 16 And he did as God commanded him: and he smote the army of the Philistines from Gabaon to Gazera. 
\v 17 And the name of David was \add famous\add* in all the land; and the Lord put the terror of him on all the nations. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1 And \add David\add* made for himself houses in the city of David, and he prepared a place for the ark of God, and made a tent for it. 
\v 2 Then said David, It is not \add lawful for any\add* to bear the ark of God, but the Levites; for the Lord has chosen them to bear the ark of the Lord, and to minister to him for ever. 
\p
\v 3 And David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the Lord to the place which he \add had\add* prepared for it. 
\v 4 And David gathered together the sons of Aaron the Levites. 
\v 5 Of the sons of Caath; \add there was\add* Uriel the chief, and his brethren, a hundred and twenty. 
\v 6 Of the sons of Merari; Asaia the chief, and his brethren, two hundred and twenty. 
\v 7 Of the sons of Gedson; Joel the chief, and his brethren, a hundred and thirty. 
\v 8 Of the sons of Elisaphat; Semei the chief, and his brethren, two hundred. 
\v 9 Of the sons of Chebrom; Eliel the chief, and his brethren eighty. 
\v 10 Of the sons of Oziel; Aminadab the chief, and his brethren a hundred and twelve. 
\p
\v 11 And David called Sadoc and Abiathar the priests, and the Levites, Uriel, Asaia, and Joel, and Semaia, and Eliel, and Aminadab, 
\v 12 and said to them, Ye \add are\add* the heads of the families of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, you and your brethren, and ye shall carry up the ark of the God of Israel, \add to the place\add* which I have prepared for it. 
\v 13 For because ye were not \add ready\add* at the first, our God made a breach upon us, because we sought him not according to the ordinance. 
\v 14 So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves, to bring up the ark of the God of Israel. 
\v 15 And the sons of the Levites took the ark of God, (as Moses commanded by the word of God according to the scripture) upon their shoulders with staves. 
\p
\v 16 And David said to the chiefs of the Levites, Set your brethren the singers with musical instruments, lutes, harps, and cymbals, to sound aloud with a voice of joy. 
\v 17 So the Levites appointed Æman the son of Joel; Asaph the son of Barachias \add was one\add* of his brethren; and Æthan the son of Kisæus was of the sons of Merari their brethren; 
\v 18 and with them their brethren of the second rank, Zacharias, and Oziel, and Semiramoth, and Jeiel, and Elioel, and Eliab, and Banaia, and Maasaia, and Matthathia, and Eliphena, and Makellia, and Abdedom, and Jeiel, and Ozias, the porters. 
\v 19 And the singers, Æman, Asaph, and Æthan, with brazen cymbals to make \add a sound\add* to be heard. 
\v 20 Zacharias, and Oziel, Semiramoth, Jeiel, Oni, Eliab, Maasæas, Banæas, with lutes, on alæmoth. 
\v 21 And Mattathias, and Eliphalu, and Makenia, and Abdedom, and Jeiel, and Ozias, with harps of Amasenith, to make a loud noise. 
\p
\v 22 And Chonenia chief of the Levites \add was\add* master of the bands, because he was skilful. 
\v 23 And Barachia and Elcana \add were\add* door-keepers of the ark. 
\v 24 And Somnia, and Josaphat, and Nathanael, and Amasai, and Zacharia, and Banæa, and Eliezer, the priests, were sounding with trumpets before the ark of God: and Abdedom and Jeia \add were\add* door-keepers of the ark of God. 
\p
\v 25 So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains of thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant from the house of Abdedom with gladness. 
\v 26 And it came to pass when God strengthened the Levites bearing the ark of the covenant of the Lord, that they sacrificed seven calves and seven rams. 
\v 27 And David \add was\add* girt with a fine linen robe, and all the Levites \add who were\add* bearing the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and the singers, and Chonenias the master of the band of singers; also upon David \add there was\add* a robe of fine linen. 
\v 28 And all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the Lord with shouting, and with the sound of a horn, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, playing loudly on lutes and harps. 
\v 29 And the ark of the covenant of the Lord arrived, and came to the city of David; and Melchol the daughter of Saul looked down through the window, and saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart. 
\c 16  
\p
\v 1 So they brought in the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tabernacle which David pitched for it; and they offered whole-burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before God. 
\v 2 And David finished offering up whole-burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and blessed the people in the name of the Lord. 
\v 3 And he divided to every man of Israel (both men and women), to \add every\add* man one baker's loaf, and a cake. 
\v 4 And he appointed before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, Levites to minister \add and\add* lift up the voice, and to give thanks and praise the Lord God of Israel: 
\v 5 Asaph \add was\add* the chief, and next to him Zacharias, Jeiel, Semiramoth, and Jeiel, Mattathias, Eliab, and Banæas, and Abdedom: and Jeiel sounding with musical instruments, lutes \add and\add* harps, and Asaph with cymbals: 
\v 6 and Banæas and Oziel the priests \add sounding\add* continually with trumpets before the ark of the covenant of God in that day. 
\p
\v 7 Then David first gave orders to praise the Lord by the hand of Asaph and his brethren. 
\p
\v 8 Song. Give thanks to the Lord, call upon him by his name, make known his designs among the people. 
\v 9 Sing \add songs\add* to him, and sing hymns to him, relate to all \add people\add* his wonderful deeds, which the Lord has wrought. 
\v 10 Praise his holy name, the heart that seeks his pleasure shall rejoice. 
\v 11 Seek the Lord and be strong, seek his face continually. 
\v 12 Remember his wonderful works which he has wrought, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth; 
\v 13  \add ye\add* seed of Israel his servants, \add ye\add* seed of Jacob his chosen ones. 
\v 14 He \add is\add* the Lord our God; his judgments \add are\add* in all the earth. 
\v 15 Let us remember his covenant for ever, his word which he commanded to a thousand generations, 
\v 16 which he covenanted with Abraham, and his oath \add sworn\add* to Isaac. 
\v 17 He confirmed it to Jacob for an ordinance, to Israel \add as\add* an everlasting covenant, 
\v 18 saying, To thee will I give the land of Chanaan, the line of your inheritance: 
\v 19 when they were few in number, when they were but little, and dwelt as strangers in it; 
\v 20 and went from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people. 
\v 21 He suffered not a man to oppress them, and he reproved kings for their sakes, 
\v 22 saying, Touch not my anointed ones, and deal not wrongfully with my prophets. 
\p
\v 23 Sing ye to the Lord, all the earth; proclaim his salvation from day to day. 
\v 23a Declare among the nations his glory, his wondrous deeds among all peoples. 
\v 25 For the Lord \add is\add* great, and greatly to be praised: he \add is\add* to be feared above all gods. 
\v 26 For all the gods of the nations \add are\add* idols; but our God made the heavens. 
\v 27 Glory and praise \add are\add* in his presence; strength and rejoicing \add are\add* in his place. 
\v 28 Give to the Lord, ye families of the nations, give to the Lord glory and strength. 
\v 29 Give to the Lord the glory \add belonging\add* to his name: take gifts and offer \add them\add* before him; and worship the Lord in his holy courts. 
\v 30 Let the whole earth fear before him; let the earth be established, and not be moved. 
\v 31 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth exult; and let them say among the nations, The Lord reigns. 
\v 32 The sea with its fulness shall resound and the tree of the field, and all things in it. 
\v 33 Then shall the trees of the wood rejoice before the Lord, for he is come to judge the earth. 
\v 34 Give thanks to the Lord, for \add it is\add* good, for his mercy \add is\add* for ever. 
\v 35 And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us, and rescue us from among the heathen, that we may praise thy holy name, and glory in thy praises. 
\v 36 Blessed \add be\add* the Lord God of Israel from everlasting and to everlasting: 
\p And all the people shall say, Amen. So they praised the Lord. 
\p
\v 37 And they left there Asaph and his brethren before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, to minister before the ark continually, according to the service of each day: from day to day. 
\v 38 And Abdedom and his brethren \add were\add* sixty and eight; and Abdedom the son of Idithun, and Osa, \add were\add* to be door-keepers. 
\v 39 And \add they appointed\add* Sadoc the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the Lord in the high place in Gabaon, 
\v 40 to offer up whole-burnt-offerings to the Lord on the altar of whole-burnt-offerings continually morning and evening, and according to all things written in the law of the Lord, which he commanded the children of Israel by Moses the servant of God. 
\v 41 And with him \add were\add* Æman and Idithun, and the rest chosen out by name to praise the Lord, for his mercy \add endures\add* for ever. 
\v 42 And with them \add there were\add* trumpets and cymbals to sound aloud, and musical instruments for the songs of God: and the sons of Idithun \add were\add* at the gate. 
\p
\v 43 And all the people went every one to his home: and David returned to bless his house. 
\c 17  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass as David dwelt in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Behold, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of the Lord \add is\add* under \add curtains\add* of skins. 
\p
\v 2 And Nathan said to David, Do all that is in thy heart; for God \add is\add* with thee. 
\p
\v 3 And it came to pass in that night, that the word of the Lord came to Nathan, \add saying\add*, 
\v 4 Go and say to David my servant, Thus said the Lord, Thou shalt not build me a house for me to dwell in it. 
\v 5 For I have not dwelt in a house from the day that I brought up Israel until this day, but I have been in a tabernacle and a tent, 
\v 6 in all places through which I have gone with all Israel: did I ever speak to \add any\add* one tribe of Israel whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, \add Why is it\add* that ye have not built me a house of cedar? 
\v 7 And now thus shalt thou say to my servant David, Thus saith the Lord Almighty, I took thee from the sheepfold, from following the flocks, to be a ruler over my people Israel: 
\v 8 and I was with thee in all places whither thou wentest, and I destroyed all thine enemies from before thee, and I made for thee a name according to the name of the great ones that are upon the earth. 
\v 9 And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and I will plant him, and he shall dwell by himself, and shall no longer be anxious; and the son of iniquity shall no longer afflict him, as at the beginning, 
\v 10 and from the days when I appointed judges over my people Israel. Also I have humbled all thine enemies, and I will increase thee, and the Lord will build thee a house. 
\v 11 And it shall come to pass when thy days shall be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom. 
\v 12 He shall build me a house, and I will set up his throne for ever. 
\v 13 I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son: and my mercy will I not withdraw from him, as I withdrew \add it\add* from them that were before thee. 
\v 14 And I will establish him in my house and in his kingdom for ever; and his throne shall be set up for ever. 
\p
\v 15 According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so spoke Nathan to David. 
\p
\v 16 And king David came and sat before the Lord, and said, Who am I, O Lord God? and what \add is\add* my house, that thou hast loved me for ever? 
\v 17 And these things were little in thy sight, O God: thou hast also spoken concerning the house of thy servant for a long time to come, and thou hast looked upon me as a man looks upon his fellow, and hast exalted me, O Lord God. 
\v 18 What shall David do more toward thee to glorify \add thee\add*? and thou knowest thy servant. 
\v 19 And thou hast wrought all this greatness according to thine heart. 
\v 20 O Lord, there is none like thee, and there is no God beside thee, according to all things which we have heard with our ears. 
\v 21 Neither is there another nation upon the earth \add such\add* as thy people Israel, whereas God led him in the way, to redeem a people for himself, to make for himself a great and glorious name, to cast out nations from before thy people, whom thou redeemedst out of Egypt. 
\v 22 And thou hast appointed thy people Israel as a people to thyself for ever; and thou, Lord, didst become a God to them. 
\v 23 And now, Lord, let the word which thou spokest to thy servant, and concerning his house, be confirmed for ever, and do thou as thou hast spoken. 
\v 24 And let thy name \add be\add* established and magnified for ever, \add men\add* saying, Lord, Lord, Almighty God of Israel: and \add let\add* the house of thy servant David \add be\add* established before thee. 
\v 25 For thou, O Lord my God, hast revealed to the ear of thy servant that thou wilt build him a house; therefore thy servant has found a willingness to pray before thee. 
\v 26 And now, Lord, thou thyself art God, and thou hast spoken these good things concerning thy servant. 
\v 27 And now thou hast begun to bless the house of thy servant, so that it should continue for ever before thee: for thou, Lord, hast blessed \add it\add*, and do thou bless \add it\add* for ever. 
\c 18  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass afterwards, that David smote the Philistines, and routed them, and took Geth and its villages out of the hand of the Philistines. 
\p
\v 2 And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became servants to David, \add and\add* tributaries. 
\p
\v 3 And David smote Adraazar king of Suba of Emath, as he was going to establish power toward the river Euphrates. 
\v 4 And David took of them a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand infantry: and David houghed all the chariot \add horses\add*, but there were reserved of them a hundred chariots. 
\v 5 And the Syrian came from Damascus to help Adraazar king of Suba; and David smote of the Syrian \add army\add* twenty and two thousand men. 
\v 6 And David put a garrison in Syria near Damascus; and they became tributary servants to David: and the Lord delivered David wherever he went. 
\v 7 And David took the golden collars that were on the servants of Adraazar, and brought them to Jerusalem. 
\v 8 And David took out of Matabeth, and out of the chief cities of Adraazar very much brass: of this Solomon made the brazen sea, and the pillars, and the brazen vessels. 
\p
\v 9 And Thoa king of Emath heard that David had smitten the whole force of Adraazar king of Suba. 
\v 10 And he sent Aduram his son to king David to ask how he was, and to congratulate him because he had fought against Adraazar, and smitten him; for Thoa was the enemy of Adraazar. 
\v 11 And all the golden and silver and brazen vessels, even these king David consecrated to the Lord, with the silver and the gold which he took from all the nations; from Idumæa, and Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalec. 
\p
\v 12 And Abesa son of Saruia smote the Idumeans in the valley of Salt, eighteen thousand. 
\v 13 And he put garrisons in the valley; and all the Idumæans became David's servants: and the Lord delivered David wherever he went. 
\p
\v 14 So David reigned over all Israel; and he executed judgment and justice to all his people. 
\v 15 And Joab the son of Saruia \add was\add* over the army, and Josaphat the son of Achilud \add was\add* recorder. 
\v 16 And Sadoc son of Achitob, and Achimelech son of Abiathar, \add were\add* the priests; and Susa \add was\add* the scribe; 
\v 17 and Banæas the son of Jodae \add was\add* over the Cherethite and the Phelethite, and the sons of David were the chief deputies of the king. 
\c 19  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass after this, \add that\add* Naas the king of the children of Ammon died, and Anan his son reigned in his stead. 
\v 2 And David said, I will act kindly toward Anan the son of Naas, as his father acted kindly towards me. And David sent messengers to condole with him on the death of his father. So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Anan, to comfort him. 
\v 3 And the chiefs of the children of Ammon said to Anan, Is it to honour thy father before thee, that David has sent comforters to thee? Have not his servants come to thee that they might search the city, and to spy out the land? 
\v 4 And Anan took the servants of David, and shaved them, and cut off the half of their garments as far as their tunic, and sent them away. 
\v 5 And there came men to report to David concerning the men: and he sent to meet them, for they were greatly disgraced: and the king said, Dwell in Jericho until your beards have grown, and return. 
\p
\v 6 And the children of Ammon saw that the people of David were ashamed, and Anan and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire for themselves chariots and horsemen out of Syria of Mesopotamia, and out of Syria Maacha, and from Sobal. 
\v 7 And they hired for themselves two and thirty thousand chariots, and the king of Maacha and his people; and they came and encamped before Medaba: and the children of Ammon assembled out of their cities, and came to fight. 
\p
\v 8 And David heard, and sent Joab and all the host of mighty men. 
\v 9 And the children of Ammon came forth, and set themselves in array for battle by the gate of the city: and the kings that were come forth encamped by themselves in the plain. 
\v 10 And Joab saw that they were fronting \add him\add* to fight against him before and behind, and he chose \add some\add* out of all the young men of Israel, and they set themselves in array against the Syrian. 
\v 11 And the rest of the people he gave into the hand of his brother Abesai, and they set themselves in array against the children of Ammon. 
\v 12 And he said, If the Syrian should prevail against me, then shalt thou deliver me: and if the children of Ammon should prevail against thee, then will I deliver thee. 
\v 13 Be of good courage, and let us be strong, for our people, and for the cities of our God: and the Lord shall do what \add is\add* good in his eyes. 
\p
\v 14 So Joab and the people that were with him set themselves in battle array against the Syrians, and they fled from them. 
\v 15 And the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians fled, and they also fled from before Abesai, and from before Joab his brother, and they came to the city: and Joab came to Jerusalem. 
\p
\v 16 And the Syrian saw that Israel had defeated him, and he sent messengers, and they brought out the Syrians from beyond the river; and Sophath the commander-in-chief of the forces of Adraazar \add was\add* before them. 
\v 17 And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and crossed over Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against them. So David set \add his army\add* in array to fight against the Syrians, and they fought against him. 
\v 18 And the Syrians fled from before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand \add riders in\add* chariots, and forty thousand infantry, and he slew Sophath the commander-in-chief of the forces. 
\v 19 And the servants of Adraazar saw that they were defeated before Israel, and they made peace with David and served him: and the Syrians would not any more help the children of Ammon. 
\c 20  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass at the return of the year, at the \add time of the\add* going forth of kings \add to war\add*, that Joab gathered the whole force of the army, and they ravaged the land of the children of Ammon; and he came and besieged Rabba. But David abode in Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabba and destroyed it. 
\v 2 And David took the crown of Molchom their king off his head, and the weight of it was found \add to be\add* a talent of gold, and on it were precious stones; and it was \add placed\add* on the head of David: and he brought out the spoils of the city \add which were\add* very great. 
\v 3 And he brought out the people that were in it, and sawed them asunder with saws, and \add cut them\add* with iron axes, and with harrows: and thus David did to all the children of Ammon. And David and all his people returned to Jerusalem. 
\p
\v 4 And it came to pass afterward that there was again war with the Philistines in Gazer: then Sobochai the Sosathite smote Saphut of the sons of the giants, and laid him low. 
\p
\v 5 And there \add was\add* war again with the Philistines; and Eleanan the son of Jair smote Lachmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, and the wood of his spear \add was\add* as a weavers' beam. 
\p
\v 6 And there was again war in Geth, and there was a man of extraordinary size, and his fingers \add and toes were\add* six on each hand and foot, four and twenty; and he was descended from the giants. 
\v 7 And he defied Israel, and Jonathan the son of Samaa the brother of David slew him. 
\v 8 These were born to Rapha in Geth; all four were giants, and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants. 
\c 21  
\p
\v 1 And the devil stood up against Israel, and moved David to number Israel. 
\v 2 And king David said to Joab and to the captains of the forces, Go, number Israel from Bersabee even to Dan, and bring me \add the account\add*, and I shall know their number. 
\v 3 And Joab said, May the Lord add to his people, a hundred-fold as many as they \add are\add*, and \add let\add* the eyes of my lord the king see \add it\add*: all \add are\add* the servants of my lord. Why does my lord seek this thing? \add do it not\add*, lest it become a sin to Israel. 
\v 4 Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab; and Joab went out and passed through all Israel, and came to Jerusalem. 
\v 5 And Joab gave the number of the mustering of the people to David: and all Israel was a million and a hundred thousand men that drew sword: and the sons of Juda \add were\add* four hundred and seventy thousand men that drew sword. 
\v 6 But he numbered not Levi and Benjamin among them; for the word of the king was painful to Joab. 
\p
\v 7 And \add there was\add* evil in the sight of the Lord respecting this thing; and he smote Israel. 
\v 8 And David said to God, I have sinned exceedingly, in that I have done this thing: and now, I pray thee, remove the sin of thy servant; for I have been exceedingly foolish. 
\p
\v 9 And the Lord spoke to Gad the seer, saying, 
\v 10 Go and speak to David, saying, Thus saith the Lord, I bring three things upon thee: choose one of them for thyself, and I will do it to thee. 
\v 11 And Gad came to David, and said to him, Thus saith the Lord, Choose for thyself, 
\v 12 either three years of famine, or that thou shouldest flee three months from the face of thine enemies, and the sword of thine enemies \add shall be employed\add* to destroy thee, or that the sword of the Lord and pestilence \add should be\add* three days in the land, and the angel of the Lord \add shall be\add* destroying in all the inheritance of Israel. And now consider what I shall answer to him that sent the message. 
\p
\v 13 And David said to Gad, They are very hard for me, even \add all\add* the three: let me fall now into the hands of the Lord, for his mercies \add are\add* very abundant, and let me not fall by any means into the hands of man. 
\p
\v 14 So the Lord brought pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men. 
\v 15 And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the Lord saw, and repented for the evil, and said to the angel that was destroying, Let it suffice thee; withhold thine hand. And the angel of the Lord stood by the threshing-floor of Orna the Jebusite. 
\v 16 And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the Lord, standing between the earth and the heaven, and his sword drawn in his hand, stretched out over Jerusalem: and David and the elders clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces. 
\v 17 And David said to God, \add Was it\add* not I \add that\add* gave orders to number the people? and I am the guilty one; I have greatly sinned: but these sheep, what have they done? O Lord God, let thy hand be upon me, and upon my father's house, and not on thy people for destruction, O Lord! 
\p
\v 18 And the angel of the Lord told Gad to tell David, that he should go up to erect an altar to the Lord, in the threshing-floor of Orna the Jebusite. 
\v 19 And David went up according to the word of Gad, which he spoke in the name of the Lord. 
\v 20 And Orna turned and saw the king; and he hid himself and his four sons with him. Now Orna was threshing wheat. 
\v 21 And David came to Orna; and Orna came forth from the threshing-floor, and did obeisance to David with his face to the ground. 
\v 22 And David said to Orna, Give me thy place of the threshing-floor, and I will build upon it an altar to the Lord: give it me for its worth in money, and the plague shall cease from \add among\add* the people. 
\v 23 And Orna said to David, Take it to thyself, and let my lord the king do what is right in his eyes: see, I have given the calves for a whole-burnt-offering, and the plough for wood, and the corn for a meat-offering; I have given all. 
\v 24 And king David said to Orna, Nay; for I will surely buy it for its worth in money: for I will not take thy property for the Lord, to offer a whole-burnt-offering to the Lord without cost \add to myself\add*. 
\v 25 And David gave to Orna for his place six hundred shekels of gold \add by\add* weight. 
\v 26 And David built there an altar to the Lord, and offered up whole-burnt-offerings and peace-offerings: and he cried to the Lord, and he answered him by fire out of heaven on the altar of whole-burnt-offerings, and \add it\add* consumed the whole-burnt-offering. 
\v 27 And the Lord spoke to the angel; and he put up the sword into its sheath. 
\p
\v 28 At that time when David saw that the Lord answered him in the threshing-floor of Orna the Jebusite, he also sacrificed there. 
\v 29 And the tabernacle of the Lord which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of whole-burnt-offerings, \add were\add* at that time in the high place at Gabaon. 
\v 30 And David could not go before it to enquire of God; for he hasted not because of the sword of the angel of the Lord. 
\c 22  
\p
\v 1 And David said, This is the house of the Lord God, and this \add is\add* the altar for whole-burnt-offering for Israel. 
\p
\v 2 And David gave orders to gather all the strangers that were in the land of Israel; and he appointed stone-hewers to hew polished stones to build the house to God. 
\v 3 And David prepared much iron for the nails of the doors and the gates; the hinges also and brass in abundance, there was no weighing \add of it\add*. 
\v 4 And cedar trees without number: for the Sidonians and the Tyrians brought cedar trees in abundance to David. 
\v 5 And David said, My son Solomon \add is\add* a tender child, and the house \add for me\add* to build to the Lord \add is\add* for superior magnificence for a name and for a glory through all the earth: I will make preparation for it. And David prepared abundantly before his death. 
\p
\v 6 And he called Solomon his son, and commanded him to build the house for the Lord God of Israel. 
\v 7 And David said to Solomon, \add My\add* child, it was in my heart to build a house to the name of the Lord God. 
\v 8 But the word of the Lord came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast carried on great wars: thou shalt not build a house to my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth before me. 
\v 9 Behold, a son shall be born to thee, he shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name \add shall be\add* Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days. 
\v 10 He shall build a house to my name; and he shall be a son to me, and I will be a father to him; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom in Israel for ever. 
\v 11 And now, my son, the Lord shall be with thee, and prosper \add thee\add*; and thou shalt build a house to the Lord thy God, as he spoke concerning thee. 
\v 12 Only may the Lord give thee wisdom and prudence, and strengthen thee over Israel, both to keep and to do the law of the Lord thy God. 
\v 13 Then will he prosper \add thee\add*, if thou take heed to do the commandments and judgments which the Lord commanded Moses for Israel: be courageous and strong; fear not, nor be terrified. 
\p
\v 14 And, behold, I according to my poverty have prepared for the house of the Lord a hundred thousand talents of gold, and a million talents of silver, and brass and iron without measure; for it is abundant; and I have prepared timber and stones; and do thou add to these. 
\v 15 And \add of them that are\add* with thee do thou add to the multitude of workmen; \add let there be\add* artificers and masons, and carpenters, and every skilful \add workman\add* in every work; 
\v 16 in gold and silver, brass and iron, \add of which\add* there is no number. Arise and do, and the Lord \add be\add* with thee. 
\p
\v 17 And David charged all the chief men of Israel to help Solomon his son, \add saying\add*, 
\v 18  \add Is\add* not the Lord with you? and he has given you rest round about, for he has given into your hands the inhabitants of the land; and the land is subdued before the Lord, and before his people. 
\v 19 Now set your hearts and souls to seek after the Lord your God: and rise, and build a sanctuary to your God to carry in the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the Lord. 
\c 23  
\p
\v 1 And David was old and full of days; and he made Solomon his son king over Israel in his stead. 
\v 2 And he assembled all the chief men of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites. 
\v 3 And the Levites numbered \add themselves\add* from thirty years old and upward; and their number by their polls amounted to thirty and eight thousand men. 
\v 4 Of the overseers over the works of the house of the Lord \add there were\add* twenty-four thousand, and \add there were\add* six thousand scribes and judges; 
\v 5 and four thousand door-keepers, and four thousand to praise the Lord with instruments which he made to praise the Lord. 
\p
\v 6 And David divided them \add into\add* daily courses, for the sons of Levi, for Gedson, Caath, and Merari. 
\v 7 And for \add the family of\add* Gedson, Edan, and Semei. 
\v 8 The sons of Edan \add were\add* Jeiel, the chief, and Zethan, and Joel, three. 
\v 9 The sons of Semei; Salomith, Jeiel, and Dan, three: these \add were\add* the chiefs of the families of Edan. 
\v 10 And to the sons of Semei, Jeth, and Ziza, and Joas, and Beria: these \add were\add* the four sons of Semei. 
\v 11 And Jeth was the chief, and Ziza the second: and Joas and Beria did not multiply sons, and they became \add only\add* one reckoning according to the house of their father. 
\p
\v 12 The sons of Caath; Ambram, Isaar, Chebron, Oziel, four. 
\v 13 The sons of Ambram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was appointed for the consecration of the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn incense before the Lord, to minister and bless in his name for ever. 
\v 14 And \add as for\add* Moses the man of God, his sons were reckoned to the tribe of Levi. 
\v 15 The sons of Moses; Gersam, and Eliezer. 
\v 16 The sons of Gersam; Subael the chief. 
\v 17 And the sons of Eliezer were, Rabia the chief: and Eliezer had no other sons; but the sons of Rabia were very greatly multiplied. 
\v 18 The sons of Isaar; Salomoth the chief. 
\v 19 The sons of Chebron; Jeria the chief, Amaria the second, Jeziel the third, Jekemias the fourth. 
\v 20 The sons of Oziel; Micha the chief, and Isia the second. 
\p
\v 21 The sons of Merari; Mooli, and Musi: the sons of Mooli; Eleazar, and Kis. 
\v 22 And Eleazar died, and he had no sons, but daughters: and the sons of Kis, their brethren, took them. 
\v 23 The sons of Musi; Mooli, and Eder, and Jarimoth, three. 
\p
\v 24 These \add are\add* the sons of Levi according to the houses of their fathers; chiefs of their families according to their numbering, according to the number of their names, according to their polls, doing the works of service of the house of the Lord, from twenty years old and upward. 
\v 25 For David said, The Lord God of Israel has given rest to his people, and has taken up his abode in Jerusalem for ever. 
\v 26 And the Levites bore not the tabernacle, and all the vessels of it for its service. 
\v 27 For by the last words of David was the number of the Levites \add taken\add* from twenty years old and upward. 
\v 28 For he appointed them to wait on Aaron, to minister in the house of the Lord, over the courts, and over the chambers, and over the purification of all the holy things, and over the works of the service of the house of God; 
\v 29 and for the shew-bread, and for the fine flour of the meat-offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for the fried cake, and for the dough, and for every measure; 
\v 30 and to stand in the morning to praise and give thanks to the Lord, and so in the evening; 
\v 31 and \add to be\add* over all the whole-burnt-offerings that were offered up to the Lord on the sabbaths, and at the new moons, and at the feasts, by number, according to the order \add given\add* to them, continually before the Lord. 
\v 32 And they are to keep the charge of the tabernacle of witness, and the charge of the holy place, and the charges of the sons of Aaron their brethren, to minister in the house of the Lord. 
\c 24  
\p
\v 1 And \add they number\add* the sons of Aaron in \add their\add* division, Nadab, and Abiud, and Eleazar, and Ithamar. 
\v 2 And Nadab and Abiud died before their father, and they had no sons: so Eleazar and Ithamar the sons of Aaron ministered as priests. 
\v 3 And David distributed them, even Sadoc of the sons of Eleazar, and Achimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their numbering, according to their service, according to the houses of their fathers. 
\p
\v 4 And there were found \add among\add* the sons of Eleazar more chiefs of the mighty ones, than of the sons of Ithamar: and he divided them, sixteen heads of families to the sons of Eleazar, eight according to \add their\add* families to the sons of Ithamar. 
\v 5 And he divided them according to their lots, one with the other; for there were those who had charge of the holy things, and those who had charge of the \add house\add* of the Lord among the sons of Eleazar, and among the sons of Ithamar. 
\p
\v 6 And Samaias the son of Nathanael, the scribe, \add of the family\add* of Levi, wrote them down before the king, and the princes, and Sadoc the priest, and Achimelech the son of Abiathar \add were present\add*; and the heads of the families of the priests and the Levites, each of a household \add were assigned\add* one to Eleazar, and one to Ithamar. 
\p
\v 7 And the first lot came out to Joarim, the second to Jedia, 
\v 8 the third to Charib, the fourth to Seorim, 
\v 9 the fifth to Melchias, the sixth to Meiamin, 
\v 10 the seventh to Cos, the eighth to Abia, 
\v 11 the ninth to Jesus, the tenth to Sechenias, 
\v 12 the eleventh to Eliabi, the twelfth to Jacim, 
\v 13 the thirteenth to Oppha, the fourteenth to Jesbaal, 
\v 14 the fifteenth to Belga, the sixteenth to Emmer, 
\v 15 the seventeenth to Chezin, the eighteenth to Aphese, 
\v 16 the nineteenth to Phetæa, the twentieth to Ezekel, 
\v 17 the twenty-first to Achim, the twenty-second to Gamul, 
\v 18 the twenty-third to Adallai, the twenty-fourth to Maasai. 
\p
\v 19 This \add is\add* their numbering according to their service to go into the house of the Lord, according to their appointment by the hand of Aaron their father, as the Lord God of Israel commanded. 
\p
\v 20 And for the sons of Levi that were left, \add even\add* for the sons of Ambram, Sobael: for the sons of Sobael, Jedia. 
\v 21 For Raabia, the chief \add was Isaari\add*, 
\v 22 and for Isaari, Salomoth: for the sons of Salomoth, Jath. 
\v 23 The sons of Ecdiu; Amadia the second, Jaziel the third, Jecmoam the fourth. 
\v 24 For the sons of Oziel, Micha: the sons of Micha; Samer. 
\v 25 The brother of Micha; Isia, the son of Isia; Zacharia. 
\v 26 The sons of Merari, Mooli, and Musi: the sons of Ozia, 
\v 27  \add That is, the sons\add* of Merari by Ozia,—his sons \add were\add* Isoam, and Sacchur, and Abai. 
\v 28 To Mooli \add were born\add* Eleazar, and Ithamar; and Eleazar died, and had no sons. 
\v 29 For Kis; the sons of Kis; Jerameel. 
\v 30 And the sons of Musi; Mooli, and Eder, and Jerimoth. These \add were\add* the sons of the Levites according to the houses of their families. 
\v 31 And they also received lots as their brethren the sons of Aaron before the king; Sadoc also, and Achimelech, and the chiefs of the families of the priests and of the Levites, principal heads of families, even as their younger brethren. 
\c 25  
\p
\v 1 And king David and the captains of the host appointed to their services the sons of Asaph, and of Æman, and of Idithun, prophesiers with harps, and lutes, and cymbals: and their number was according to their polls serving in their ministrations. 
\p
\v 2 The sons of Asaph; Sacchur, Joseph, and Nathanias, and Erael: the sons of Asaph \add were\add* next the king. 
\p
\v 3 To Idithun \add were reckoned\add* the sons of Idithun, Godolias, and Suri, and Iseas, and Asabias, and Matthathias, six after their father Idithun, sounding loudly on the harp thanksgiving and praise to the Lord.

\v 5 All these \add were\add* the sons of Æman the king's chief player in the praises of God, to lift up the horn. And God gave to Æman fourteen sons, and three daughters. 
\v 6 All these sang hymns with their father in the house of God, with cymbals, and lutes, and harps, for the service of the house of God, near the king, and Asaph, and Idithun, and Æman. 
\p
\v 7 And the number of them after their brethren, those instructed to sing to God, every one that understood \add singing\add* was two hundred and eighty-eight. 
\p
\v 8 And they also cast lots for the daily courses, for the great and the small \add of them\add*, of the perfect ones and the learners. 
\v 9 And the first lot of his sons and of his brethren came forth to Asaph the son of Joseph, \add namely\add*, Godolias: the second Heneia, his sons and his brethren \add being\add* twelve.

\p
\v 12 To these \add were assigned\add* the divisions of the gates, to the chiefs of the mighty men the daily courses, even their brethren, to minister in the house of the Lord. 
\v 13 And they cast lots for the small as well as for the great, for the several gates, according to their families. 
\v 14 And the lot of the east gates fell to Selemias, and Zacharias: the sons of Soaz cast lots for Melchias, and the lot came out northward. 
\v 15 To Abdedom \add they gave by lot\add* the south, opposite the house of Esephim. 
\v 16  \add They gave the lot\add* for the second to Osa westward, after the gate of the chamber by the ascent, watch against watch.

\v 27 things which he took out of cities and from the spoils, and consecrated some of them, so that the building of the house of God should not want \add supplies\add*; 
\v 28 and over all the holy things of God dedicated by Samuel the prophet, and Saul the son of Kis, and Abenner the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Saruia, whatsoever they sanctified \add was\add* by the hand of Salomoth and his brethren. 
\p

\p
\v 23 But David took not their number from twenty years old and under: because the Lord said that he would multiply Israel as the stars of the heaven. 
\v 24 And Joab the son of Saruia began to number the people, and did not finish the work, for there was hereupon wrath on Israel; and the number was not recorded in the book of the chronicles of king David. 
\p
\v 25 And over the king's treasures \add was\add* Asmoth the son of Odiel; and over the treasures in the country, and in the towns, and in the villages, and in the towers, \add was\add* Jonathan the son of Ozia.

\c 28  
\p
\v 1 And David assembled all the chief \add men\add* of Israel, the chief of the judges, and all the chief \add men\add* of the courses \add of attendance\add* on the person of the king, and the captains of thousands and hundreds, and the treasurers, and the lords of his substance, and of all the king's property, and of his sons, together with the eunuchs, and the mighty men, and the warriors of the army, at Jerusalem. 
\p
\v 2 And David stood in the midst of the assembly, and said, Hear me, my brethren, and my people: it was in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and a place for the feet of our Lord, and I prepared \add materials\add* suitable for the building: 
\v 3 but God said, Thou shalt not build me a house to call my name upon it, for thou art a man of war, and hast shed blood. 
\v 4 Yet the Lord God of Israel chose me out of the whole house of my father to be king over Israel for ever; and he chose Juda as the kingly \add house\add*, and out of the house of Juda \add he chose\add* the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he preferred me, that I should be king over all Israel. 
\v 5 And of all my sons, (for the Lord has given me many sons,) he has chosen Solomon my son, to set him on the throne of the kingdom of the Lord over Israel. 
\v 6 And God said to me, Solomon thy son shall build my house and my court: for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be to him a father. 
\v 7 And I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he continue to keep my commandments, and my judgments, as \add at\add* this day. 
\v 8 And now \add I charge you\add* before the whole assembly of the Lord, and in the audience of our God, keep and seek all the commandments of the Lord our God, that ye may inherit the good land, and leave it for your sons to inherit after you for ever. 
\p
\v 9 And now, \add my\add* son Solomon, know the God of thy fathers, and serve him with a perfect heart and willing soul: for the Lord searches all hearts, and knows every thought: if thou seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou shouldest forsake him, he will forsake thee for ever. 
\v 10 See now, for the Lord has chosen thee to build him a house for a sanctuary, be strong and do \add it\add*. 
\p
\v 11 And David gave Solomon his son the plan of the temple, and its buildings, and its treasuries, and its upper chambers, and the inner store-rooms, and the place of the atonement, 
\v 12 and the plan which he had in his mind of the courts of the house of the Lord, and of all the chambers round about, \add designed\add* for the treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries of the holy things, and of the chambers for resting: 
\v 13 and \add the plan\add* of the courses of the priests and Levites, for all the work of the service of the house of the Lord, and of the stores of vessels for ministration of the service of the house of the Lord. 
\v 14 And \add he gave him\add* the account of their weight, both of gold and silver \add vessels\add*. 
\v 15 He gave him the weight of the candlesticks, and of the lamps. 
\v 16 He gave him likewise the weight of the tables of shewbread, of each table of gold, and likewise of the \add tables of\add* silver: 
\v 17 also of the flesh-hooks, and vessels for drink-offering, and golden bowls: and the weight of the gold and silver \add articles\add*, and censers, \add and\add* bowls, according to the weight of each. 
\v 18 And he shewed him the weight \add of the utensils\add* of the altar of incense, \add which was\add* of pure gold, and the plan of the chariot of the cherubs that spread out their wings, and overshadowed the ark of the covenant of the Lord. 
\v 19 David gave all to Solomon in the Lord's handwriting, according to the knowledge given him of the work of the pattern. 
\p
\v 20 And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong, and play the man, and do: fear not, neither be terrified; for the Lord my God \add is\add* with thee; he will not forsake thee, and will not fail thee, until thou hast finished all the work of the service of the house of the Lord. And behold the pattern of the temple, even his house, and its treasury, and the upper chambers, and the inner store-rooms, and the place of propitiation, and the plan of the house of the Lord. 
\v 21 And see, \add here are\add* the courses of the priests and Levites for all the service of the house of the Lord, and \add there shall be\add* with thee \add men\add* for every workmanship, and every one of ready skill in every art: also the chief men and all the people, \add ready\add* for all thy commands. 
\c 29  
\p
\v 1 And David the king said to all the congregation, Solomon my son, whom the Lord has chosen, \add is\add* young and tender, and the work \add is\add* great; for \add it is\add* not for man, but for the Lord God. 
\v 2 I have prepared according to all \add my\add* might for the house of my God gold, silver, brass, iron, wood, onyx stones, and costly and variegated stones for setting, and every precious stone, and much Parian \add marble\add*. 
\v 3 And still farther, because I took pleasure in the house of my God, I have gold and silver which I have procured for myself, and, behold, I have given them to the house of my God over and above, beyond what I have prepared for the holy house. 
\v 4 Three thousand talents of gold of Suphir, and seven thousand talents of fine silver, for the overlaying of the walls of the sanctuary: 
\v 5  \add for thee to use\add* the gold for \add things of\add* gold, and the silver for things of silver, and for every work by the hand of the artificers. And who is willing to dedicate himself in work this day for the Lord? 
\p
\v 6 Then the heads of families, and the princes of the children of Israel, and the captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, and the overseers of the works, and the king's builders, offered willingly. 
\v 7 And they gave for the works of the house of the Lord five thousand talents of gold, and ten thousand gold \add pieces\add*, and ten thousand talents of silver, and eighteen thousand talents of brass, and a hundred thousand talents of iron. 
\v 8 And they who had \add precious\add* stone, gave it into the treasuries of the house of the Lord by the hand of Jeiel the Gedsonite. 
\v 9 And the people rejoiced because of the willingness, for they offered willingly to the Lord with a full heart: and king David rejoiced greatly. 
\p
\v 10 And king David blessed the Lord before the congregation, saying, 
\p Blessed art thou, O Lord God of Israel, our Father, from everlasting and to everlasting. 
\v 11 Thine, O Lord, \add is\add* the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the might: for thou art Lord of all things that are in heaven and upon the earth: before thy face every king and nation is troubled. 
\v 12 From thee \add come\add* wealth and glory: thou, O Lord, rulest over all, the Lord of all dominion, and in thy hand \add is\add* strength and rule; and \add thou art\add* almighty with thy hand to increase and establish all things. 
\v 13 And now, Lord, we give thanks to thee, and praise thy glorious name. 
\v 14 But who am I, and what \add is\add* my people, that we have been able to be thus forward \add in offering\add* to thee? for all things \add are\add* thine, and of thine own have we given thee, 
\v 15 for we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as all our fathers \add were\add*: our days upon the earth \add are\add* as a shadow, and there is no remaining. 
\v 16 O Lord our God, as for all this abundance which I have prepared that a house should be built to thy holy name, it is of thy hand, and all \add is\add* thine. 
\v 17 And I know, Lord, that thou art he that searches the hearts, and thou lovest righteousness. I have willingly offered all these things in simplicity of heart; and now I have seen with joy thy people here present, willingly offering to thee. 
\v 18 O Lord God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, preserve these things in the thought of the heart of thy people for ever, and direct their hearts to thee. 
\v 19 And to Solomon my son give a good heart, to perform thy commandments, and \add to observe\add* thy testimonies, and thine ordinances, and to accomplish the building of thy house. 
\p
\v 20 And David said to the whole congregation, Bless ye the Lord our God. And all the congregation blessed the Lord God of their fathers, and they bowed the knee and worshipped the Lord, and \add did obeisance\add* to the king. 
\v 21 And David sacrificed to the Lord, and offered up whole-burnt-offerings to the Lord on the morrow after the first day, a thousand calves, a thousand rams, a thousand lambs, and their drink-offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel. 
\v 22 And they ate and drank joyfully that day before the Lord: and they made Solomon the son of David king a second time, and anointed him king before the Lord, and Sadoc to the priesthood. 
\p
\v 23 And Solomon sat upon the throne of his father David, and was highly honoured; and all Israel obeyed him. 
\v 24 The princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons of king David his father, were subject to him. 
\v 25 And the Lord magnified Solomon over all Israel, and gave him royal glory, such as was not upon any king before him. 
\p
\v 26 And David the son of Jessæ reigned over Israel forty years; 
\v 27 seven years in Chebron, and thirty-three years in Jerusalem. 
\v 28 And he died in a good old age, full of days, in wealth, and glory: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead. 
\v 29 And the rest of the acts of David, the former and the latter, are written in the history of Samuel the seer, and in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the history of Gad the seer, 
\v 30 concerning all his reign, and his power, and the times which went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the earth.
