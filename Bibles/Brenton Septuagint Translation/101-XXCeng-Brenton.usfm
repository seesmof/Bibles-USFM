\ip This edition corrects a number of errors found in the 1870 printed diglot edition of Brenton’s English text. These corrections are documented below. Each note lists what is printed in Brenton’s 1870 text and either Brenton’s 1844 text (for the Old Testament books) or the Authorized Version (for Apocryphal books), which Brenton adapted for his translation. When necessary Valpy’s Greek text is also cited. 
\ip Please note that the first chapter of each book and the first verse in each chapter have been marked with the number 1 even though they are not generally marked in the 1870 edition of Brenton’s text. Also, for the sake of consistency, punctuation marks occurring at the end of added text have not been marked as added in the present edition. This change was made because often the punctuation would still be required even if the added text were to be excluded.
