\v 1  \sc Blessed\sc* is the man who has not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, and has not stood in the way of sinners, and has not sat in the seat of \f + \fr 1:1  \fqa Gr. \ft pestilent.\f*evil men. 
\v 2 But his \f + \fr 1:2  \fqa Gr. \ft will.\f*pleasure is in the law of the Lord; and in his law will he meditate day and night. 
\v 3 And he shall be as a tree planted by the brooks of waters, which shall yield its fruit in its season, and its leaf shall not fall off; and whatsoever he shall do shall be prospered. 
\p
\v 4 Not so the ungodly;—not so: but rather as the \f + \fr 1:4  \fqa Or, \ft dust or down.\f*chaff which the wind scatters away from the face of the earth. 
\v 5 Therefore the ungodly shall not rise in judgment, nor sinners in the counsel of the just. 
\v 6 For the Lord knows the way of the righteous; but the way of the ungodly shall perish. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1  \x + \xo 2:1  \xt Acts 4. 25.\x* Wherefore did the heathen rage, and the nations imagine vain things? 
\v 2 The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers gathered themselves together, against the Lord, and against his Christ; 
\v 3  \add saying\add*, Let us break through their bonds, and cast away their yoke from us. 
\p
\v 4 He that dwells in the heavens shall laugh them to scorn, and the Lord shall mock them. 
\v 5 Then shall he speak to them in his anger, and trouble them in his fury. 
\v 6 But I have been made king by him on Sion his holy mountain, 
\v 7 declaring the ordinance of the Lord: the Lord said to me, \x + \xo 2:7  \xt Acts 13. 33; Heb. 1. 5.\x* Thou art my Son, to-day have I begotten thee. 
\v 8 Ask of me, and I will give thee the heathen \add for\add* thine inheritance, and the ends of the earth \add for\add* thy possession. 
\v 9 Thou shalt \f + \fr 2:9  \fqa Gr. \ft tend them as a shepherd. \xt Rev. 2. 27.\f*rule them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces as a potter's vessel. 
\p
\v 10 Now therefore understand, ye kings: be instructed, all ye that judge the earth. 
\v 11 Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice in him with trembling. 
\v 12  \f + \fr 2:12  \fqa Note. \ft - This rendering or a similar one the Jews maintain.\f*Accept correction, lest at any time the Lord be angry, and ye should perish from the righteous way: whensoever his wrath shall be suddenly kindled, blessed are all they that trust in him. 
\c 3  
\d
\v 1 A Psalm of David, when he fled from the presence of his son Abessalom. 
\p
\v 2 O Lord, why are they that afflict me multiplied? many rise up against me. 
\v 3 Many say concerning my soul, There is no deliverance for him in his God. \f + \fr 3:3  \ft The word Διάψαλμα (Selah) has been rendered Pause, as most intelligible to the English reader.\f*Pause. 
\p
\v 4 But thou, O Lord, art my helper: my glory, and the one that lifts up my head. 
\v 5 I cried to the Lord with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy mountain. Pause. 
\v 6 I lay down and slept; I awaked; for the Lord will help me. 
\v 7 I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, who beset me round about. 
\v 8 Arise, Lord; deliver me, my God: for thou hast smitten all who were without cause mine enemies; thou hast broken the teeth of sinners. 
\v 9 Deliverance is the Lord's, and thy blessing is upon thy people. 
\c 4  
\d
\v 1 For the end, a Song of David among \add the \add*Psalms. 
\p
\v 2 When I called upon \add him\add*, the God of my righteousness heard me: thou hast made room for me in tribulation; pity me, and hearken to my prayer. 
\p
\v 3 O ye sons of men, how long \add will ye be\add* \f + \fr 4:3  \fqa Lit. \ft heavy of heart.\f*slow of heart? wherefore do ye love vanity, and seek falsehood? Pause. 
\v 4 But know ye that the Lord has done wondrous things for his holy one: the Lord will hear me when I cry to him. 
\v 5  \x + \xo 4:5  \xt Eph. 4. 26.\x* Be ye angry, and sin not; feel compunction upon your beds for what ye say in your hearts. Pause. 
\v 6 Offer the sacrifice of righteousness, and trust in the Lord. 
\p
\v 7 Many say, Who will shew us good things? the light of thy countenance, O Lord, has been manifested towards us. 
\v 8 Thou hast put gladness into my heart: they have been satisfied with the fruit of their corn and wine and oil. 
\v 9 I will \f + \fr 4:9  \fqa Or, \ft at the same time.\f*both lie down in peace and sleep: for thou, Lord, only hast caused me to dwell securely. 
\c 5  
\d
\v 1 For the end, a Psalm of David, concerning her that inherits. 
\p
\v 2 Hearken to my words, O Lord, \f + \fr 5:2  \fqa Lit. \ft understand.\f*attend to my cry. 
\v 3 Attend to the voice of my supplication, my King, and my God: for to thee, O Lord, will I pray. 
\v 4 In the morning thou shalt hear my voice: in the morning will I wait upon thee, and will look up. 
\v 5 For thou art not a God that desires iniquity; neither shall the worker of wickedness dwell with thee. 
\v 6 Neither shall the transgressors continue in thy sight: thou hatest, O Lord, all them that work iniquity. 
\v 7 Thou wilt destroy all that speak falsehood: the Lord abhors the bloody and deceitful man. 
\v 8 But I will enter into thine house in the multitude of thy mercy: I will worship in thy fear toward thy holy temple. 
\p
\v 9 Lead me, O Lord, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make my way plain before thy face. 
\v 10 For there is no truth in their mouth; their heart is vain; their \x + \xo 5:10  \xt Rom. 3. 13.\x* throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit. 
\v 11 Judge them, O God; let them \f + \fr 5:11  \fqa Gr. \ft fall from, \fqa or, \ft by reason of.\f*fail of their counsels: cast them out according to the abundance of their ungodliness; for they have provoked thee, O Lord. 
\p
\v 12 But let all that trust on thee be glad in thee: they shall exult for ever, and thou shalt dwell among them; and all that love thy name shall rejoice in thee. 
\v 13 For thou, Lord, shalt bless the righteous: thou hast \f + \fr 5:13  \fqa Lit. \ft crowned.\f*compassed us as with a shield of favour. 
\c 6  
\d
\v 1 For the end, a Psalm of David among the Hymns for the eighth. 
\p
\v 2 O Lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath, neither chasten me in thine anger. 
\v 3 Pity me, O Lord; for I am weak: heal me, O Lord; for my bones are vexed. 
\v 4 My soul also is grievously vexed: but thou, O Lord, how long? 
\v 5 Return, O Lord, deliver my soul: save me for thy mercy's sake. 
\v 6 For in death no man remembers thee: and who will give thee thanks in Hades? 
\v 7  \f + \fr 6:7  \fqa Gr. \ft I have laboured.\f*I am wearied with my groaning; I shall wash my bed every night; I shall water my couch with my tears. 
\v 8 Mine eye is troubled because of my wrath; I am worn out because of all my enemies. 
\p
\v 9 Depart from me, all ye that work iniquity; for the Lord has heard the voice of my weeping. 
\v 10 The Lord has hearkened to my petition; the Lord has accepted my prayer. 
\v 11 Let all mine enemies be put to shame and sore troubled: let them be turned back and grievously put to shame speedily. 
\c 7  
\d
\v 1 A Psalm of David, which he sang to the Lord because of the words of Chusi the \f + \fr 7:1  \fqa Lit. \ft son of Jemini.\f*Benjamite. 
\p
\v 2 O Lord my God, in thee have I trusted: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me. 
\v 3 Lest at any time \add the enemy\add* seize my soul as a lion, while there is none to ransom, nor to save. 
\p
\v 4 O Lord my God, if I have done this; (if there is unrighteousness in my hands;) 
\v 5 if I have requited with evil those who requited me \add with good\add*; may I then perish empty by means of my enemies. 
\v 6 Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; and let him trample my life on the ground, and lay my glory in the dust. Pause. 
\p
\v 7 Arise, O Lord, in thy wrath; be exalted \f + \fr 7:7  \fqa Heb. \ft 'because of mine enemies.'\f*in the utmost boundaries of mine enemies: awake, O Lord my God, according to the decree which thou didst command. 
\v 8 And the congregation of the nations shall compass thee: and for this cause do thou return on high. 
\v 9 The Lord shall judge the nations: judge me, O Lord, according to my righteousness, and according to my innocence that is in me. 
\v 10 Oh let the wickedness of sinners come to an end; and \add then\add* thou shalt direct the righteous, O God that searchest the hearts and reins. 
\p
\v 11 My help is righteous, \add coming\add* from God who saves the upright in heart. 
\v 12 God is a righteous judge, and strong, and patient, not inflicting vengeance every day. 
\v 13 If ye will not repent, he will furbish his sword; he has bent his bow, and made it ready. 
\v 14 And on it he has fitted the instruments of death; he has completed his arrows for the \f + \fr 7:14  \ft See \fqa Heb. \ft perhaps 'persecuting ones.'\f*raging ones. 
\p
\v 15 Behold, he has travailed with unrighteousness, he has conceived trouble, and brought forth iniquity. 
\v 16 He has opened a pit, and dug it up, and he shall fall into the ditch which he has made. 
\v 17 His trouble shall return on his own head, and his unrighteousness shall come down on his own crown. 
\v 18 I will give thanks to the Lord according to his righteousness; I will sing to the name of the Lord most high. 
\c 8  
\d
\v 1 For the end, concerning the wine-presses, a Psalm of David. 
\p
\v 2 O Lord, our Lord, how wonderful is thy name in all the earth! for thy magnificence is exalted above the heavens. 
\v 3  \x + \xo 8:3  \xt Mat. 21. 16.\x* Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou perfected praise, because of thine enemies; that thou mightest put down the enemy and avenger. 
\p
\v 4 For I will regard the heavens, the work of thy fingers; the moon and stars, which thou hast established. 
\v 5  \x + \xo 8:5  \xt Heb. 2. 6-9.\x* What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him? 
\v 6 Thou madest him a little less than angels, thou hast crowned him with glory and honour; 
\v 7 and thou hast set him over the works of thy hands: thou hast put all things under his feet: 
\v 8 sheep and all \f + \fr 8:8  \fqa Gr. \ft cows.\f*oxen, yea, and the cattle of the field; 
\v 9 the birds of the sky, and the fish of the sea, the \add creatures\add* passing through the paths of the sea. 
\v 10 O Lord our Lord, how wonderful is thy name in all the earth! 
\c 9  
\d
\v 1 For the end, a Psalm of David, concerning the secrets of the Son. 
\p
\v 2 I will give thanks to thee, O Lord, with my whole heart; I will recount all thy wonderful works. 
\v 3 I will be glad and exult in thee: I will sing to thy name, O thou Most High. 
\p
\v 4 When mine enemies are turned back, they shall be feeble and perish at thy presence. 
\v 5 For thou hast maintained my cause and my right; thou satest on the throne, that judgest righteousness. 
\v 6 Thou hast rebuked the nations, and the ungodly one has perished; thou hast blotted out their name for ever, even for ever and ever. 
\v 7 The swords of the enemy have failed utterly; and thou hast destroyed cities: their memorial has been destroyed with a noise, 
\v 8 but the Lord endures for ever: he has prepared his throne for judgment. 
\v 9 And he will judge the world in righteousness, he will judge the nations in uprightness. 
\v 10 The Lord also is become a refuge for the poor, a seasonable help, in affliction. 
\v 11 And let them that know thy name hope in thee: for thou, O Lord, hast not failed them that diligently seek thee. 
\p
\v 12 Sing praises to the Lord, who dwells in Sion: declare his dealings among the nations. 
\v 13 For he remembered them, \add in\add* making inquisition for blood: he has not forgotten the supplication of the poor. 
\p
\v 14 Have mercy upon me, O Lord; look upon my affliction \add which I suffer\add* of mine enemies, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death: 
\v 15 that I may declare all thy praises in the gates of the daughter of Sion: I will exult in thy salvation. 
\p
\v 16 The heathen are caught in the destruction which they planned: in the very snare which they hid is their foot taken. 
\v 17 The Lord is known as executing judgments: the sinner is taken in the works of his hands. A song of Pause. 
\v 18 Let sinners be driven away into Hades, \add even\add* all the nations that forget God. 
\v 19 For the poor shall not be forgotten for ever: the patience of the needy ones shall not perish for ever. 
\v 20 Arise, O Lord, let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged before thee. 
\v 21 Appoint, O Lord, a lawgiver over them: let the heathen know that they are men. Pause. 
\p
\v 22  \f + \fr 9:22  \fqa Note.\ft —Here begins a change of numbers as compared with the \fqa Heb. \ft which continues to Ps. 146, this psalm having no number, and the eleventh being called the tenth. The following verses 22-39 are numbered 1-18 in the original text.\f*Why standest thou afar off, O Lord? \add why\add* dost thou overlook \add us\add* in times of need, in affliction? 
\v 23 While the ungodly one acts proudly, the poor is \f + \fr 9:23  \fqa Gr. \ft inflamed, as in a fever.\f*hotly pursued: \add the wicked\add* are taken in the crafty counsels which they imagine. 
\v 24 Because the sinner praises himself for the desires of his heart; and the unjust one blesses himself. 
\v 25 The sinner has provoked the Lord: according to the abundance of his \f + \fr 9:25  \fqa Or, \ft anger.\f*pride he will not seek after \add him\add*: God is not before him. 
\v 26 His ways are \f + \fr 9:26  \fqa Gr. \ft profaned.\f*profane at all times; thy judgments are removed from before him: he will gain the mastery over all his enemies. 
\v 27 For he has said in his heart, I shall not be moved, \add continuing\add* without evil from generation to generation. \x + \xo 9:27  \xt Rom. 8. 14.\x* 
\v 28 Whose mouth is full of cursing, and bitterness, and fraud: under his tongue are trouble and pain. 
\v 29 He lies in wait with rich \add men\add* in secret places, in order to slay the innocent: his eyes are \f + \fr 9:29  \fqa Gr. \ft look.\f*set against the poor. 
\v 30 He lies in wait in secret as a lion in his den: he lies in wait to ravish the poor, to ravish the poor when he draws him \add after him\add*: he will bring him down in his snare. 
\v 31 He will bow down and fall when he has mastered the poor. 
\v 32 For he has said in his heart, God has forgotten: he has turned away his face so as never to look. 
\p
\v 33 Arise, O Lord God; let thy hand be lifted up: forget not the poor. 
\v 34 Wherefore has the wicked provoked God? for he has said in his heart, He will not require \add it\add*. 
\v 35 Thou seest \add it\add*; for thou dost observe trouble and wrath, to deliver them into thy hands: the poor has been left to thee; thou wast a helper to the orphan. 
\v 36 Break thou the arm of the sinner and wicked man: his sin shall be sought for, and shall not be found. 
\p
\v 37 The Lord shall reign for ever, even for ever and ever: ye Gentiles shall perish out of his land. 
\v 38 The Lord has heard the desire of the poor: thine ear has inclined to the preparation of their heart; 
\v 39 to plead for the orphan and afflicted, that man may no more boast upon the earth. 
\c 10  
\d
\v 1 For the end, a Psalm of David. 
\p In the Lord I have put my trust: how will ye say to my soul, Flee to the mountains as a sparrow? 
\v 2 For behold the sinners have bent \add their\add* bow, they have prepared their arrows for the quiver, to shoot \f + \fr 10:2  \fqa Gr. \ft in dark moon, or little moonlight, \fqa q. d. \ft luce malignâ.\f*privily at the upright in heart. 
\v 3 For they have pulled down what thou didst frame, but what has the righteous done? 
\p
\v 4 The Lord is in his holy temple, as for the Lord, his throne is in heaven: his eyes look upon the poor, his eyelids try the sons of men. 
\v 5 The Lord tries the righteous and the ungodly: and he that loves unrighteousness hates his own soul. 
\v 6 He shall rain upon sinners snares, fire, and brimstone, and a stormy blast \add shall be\add* the portion of their cup. 
\v 7 For the Lord \add is\add* righteous, and loves \f + \fr 10:7  \fqa Gr. \ft righteousnesses.\f*righteousness; his face beholds uprightness. 
\c 11  
\d
\v 1 For the end, a Psalm of David, upon the eighth. 
\p
\v 2 Save me, O Lord; for the godly man has failed; for \f + \fr 11:2  \fqa Gr. \ft truths are become rare.\f*truth is diminished from among the children of men. 
\v 3 Every one has spoken vanity to his neighbour: their lips are deceitful, they have spoken with a double heart. 
\v 4 Let the Lord destroy all the deceitful lips, and the tongue that speaks great words: 
\v 5 who have said, We will magnify our tongue; our lips are our own: who is Lord of us? 
\p
\v 6 Because of the misery of the poor, and because of the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the Lord, I will set \add them\add* in safety; I will speak \add to them\add* thereof openly. 
\v 7 The oracles of the Lord are pure oracles; as silver tried in the fire, proved \add in\add* \f + \fr 11:7  \fqa Gr. \ft the earth.\f*a furnace of earth, purified seven times. 
\v 8 Thou, O Lord, shalt keep us, and shalt preserve us, from this generation, and for ever. 
\v 9 The ungodly walk around: according to thy greatness thou hast greatly exalted the sons of men. 
\c 12  
\d
\v 1 For the end, a Psalm of David. 
\p
\v 2 How long, O Lord, wilt thou forget me? for ever? how long wilt thou turn away thy face from me? 
\v 3 How long shall I take counsel in my soul, \add having\add* sorrows in my heart daily? how long shall my enemy be exalted over me? 
\v 4 Look on me, hearken to me, O Lord my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep in death; 
\v 5 lest at any time mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him: my persecutors will exult if ever I should be moved. 
\p
\v 6 But I have hoped in thy mercy; my heart shall exult in thy salvation. I will sing to the Lord who has dealt bountifully with me, and I will sing psalms to the name of the Lord most high. 
\c 13  
\d
\v 1 For the end, a Psalm of David. 
\p The fool has said in his heart, There is no God. They have corrupted \add themselves\add*, and become abominable in their devices; there is none that does goodness, there is not even so much as one. 
\v 2 The Lord looked down from heaven upon the sons of men, to see if there were any that understood, or sought after God. 
\v 3 They are all gone out of the way, they are together become good for nothing, there is none that does good, no not one. Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips: whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness; their feet are swift to shed blood: destruction and misery are in their ways; and the way of peace they have not known: there is no fear of God before their eyes. 
\p
\v 4 Will not all the workers of iniquity know, who eat up my people as they would eat bread? they have not called upon the Lord. 
\v 5 There were they alarmed with fear, where there was no fear; for God is in the righteous generation. 
\v 6 Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the Lord is his hope. 
\v 7 Who will bring the salvation of Israel out of Sion? when the Lord brings back the captivity of his people, let Jacob exult, and Israel be glad. 
\c 14  
\d
\v 1 A Psalm of David. 
\p O Lord, who shall sojourn in thy tabernacle? and who shall dwell in thy holy mountain? 
\p
\v 2 He that walks blameless, and works righteousness, who speaks truth in his heart. 
\v 3 Who has not spoken craftily with his tongue, neither has done evil to his neighbour, nor taken up a reproach against them that dwelt nearest to him. 
\v 4 In his sight an evil-worker is set at nought, but he honours them that fear the Lord. He swears to his neighbour, and disappoints \add him\add* not. 
\v 5 He has not \f + \fr 14:5  \fqa Gr. \ft given.\f*lent his money on usury, and has not received bribes against the innocent. He that does these things shall never be moved. 
\c 15  
\d
\v 1 A writing of David. 
\p Keep me, O Lord; for I have hoped in thee. 
\v 2 I said to the Lord, Thou art my Lord; for thou hast no need of my \f + \fr 15:2  \fqa Gr. \ft good deeds, or things.\f*goodness. 
\v 3 On behalf of the saints that are in his land, he has magnified all his pleasure in them. 
\v 4 Their weaknesses have been multiplied; afterward they hasted. I will by no means assemble their bloody meetings, neither will I make mention of their names with my lips. 
\v 5 The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou art he that restores my inheritance to me. 
\v 6 The lines have fallen to me in the best places, yea, I have a most excellent heritage. 
\p
\v 7 I will bless the Lord who has instructed me; my reins too have chastened me even \f + \fr 15:7  \fqa Possibly, \ft during the night. \fqa q. d. \ft as long as night lasted.\f*till night. 
\v 8 I foresaw the Lord always before my face; for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved. 
\v 9 Therefore my heart rejoiced and my tongue exulted; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope: 
\v 10 because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. 
\v 11 Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou wilt fill me with joy with thy countenance: at thy right hand \add there are\add* delights for ever. 
\c 16  
\d
\v 1 A Prayer of David. 
\p Hearken, O Lord \f + \fr 16:1  \fqa Or, \ft to my righteous plea, etc.\f*of my righteousness, attend to my petition; give ear to my prayer not \add uttered\add* with deceitful lips. 
\v 2 Let my judgment come forth from thy presence; let mine eyes behold righteousness. 
\v 3 Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited \add me\add* by night; thou hast tried me as with fire, and unrighteousness has not been found in me: \add I am purposed\add* that my mouth shall not speak \add amiss\add*. 
\v 4 As for the works of men, by the words of thy lips I have \f + \fr 16:4  \fqa Lit. \ft I have observed hard ways.\f*guarded \add myself from\add* hard ways. 
\v 5 Direct my steps in thy paths, that my steps slip not. 
\p
\v 6 I have cried, for thou heardest me, O God: incline thine ear to me, and hearken to my words. 
\v 7 Shew the marvels of thy mercies, thou that savest them that hope in thee. 
\v 8 Keep me as the apple of the eye from those that resist thy right hand: thou shalt screen me by the covering of thy wings, 
\v 9 from the face of the ungodly that have afflicted me: mine enemies have compassed about my soul. 
\v 10 They have enclosed \add themselves with\add* their own fat: their mouth has spoken pride. 
\v 11 They have now cast me out and compassed me round about: they have set their eyes \add so as\add* to bow them down to the ground. 
\v 12 They laid wait for me as a lion ready for prey, and like a lion's whelp dwelling in secret \add places\add*. 
\v 13 Arise, O Lord, prevent them, and cast them down: deliver my soul from the ungodly: \add draw\add* thy sword, 
\v 14 because of the enemies of thine hand: O Lord, destroy them from the earth; scatter them in their life, though their belly has been filled with thy hidden \add treasures\add*: they have been satisfied with \f + \fr 16:14  \fqa Alex. \ft children.\f*uncleanness, and have left the remnant \add of their possessions\add* to their babes. 
\p
\v 15 But I shall appear in righteousness before thy face: I shall be satisfied when thy glory appears. 
\c 17  
\d
\v 1 For the end, \add a Psalm\add* of David the servant of the Lord; \add the words\add* which he spoke to the Lord, \add even\add* the words of this Song, in the day in which the Lord delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul: and he said: 
\p
\v 2 I will love thee, O Lord, my strength. 
\v 3 The Lord is my firm support, and my refuge, and my deliverer; my God is my helper, I will hope in him; \add he is\add* my defender, and the horn of my salvation, and my helper. 
\v 4 I will call upon the Lord with praises, and I shall be saved from mine enemies. 
\v 5 The pangs of death compassed me, and the torrents of ungodliness troubled me exceedingly. 
\v 6 The pangs of hell came round about me: the snares of death prevented me. 
\p
\v 7 And when I was afflicted I called upon the Lord, and cried to my God: he heard my voice out of his holy temple, and my cry shall enter before him, \add even\add* into his ears. 
\p
\v 8 Then the earth shook and quaked, and the foundations of the mountains were disturbed, and were shaken, because God was angry with them. 
\v 9 There went up a smoke in his wrath, and fire burst into a flame at his presence: coals were kindled at it. 
\v 10 And he bowed the heaven, and came down: and thick darkness was under his feet. 
\v 11 And he mounted on cherubs and flew: he flew on the wings of winds. 
\v 12 And he made darkness his secret place: round about him was his tabernacle, \add even\add* dark water in the clouds of the air. 
\v 13 At the brightness before him the clouds passed, hail and coals of fire. 
\v 14 The Lord also thundered from heaven, and the Highest uttered his voice. 
\v 15 And he sent forth \add his\add* weapons, and scattered them; and multiplied lightnings, and routed them. 
\v 16 And the springs of waters appeared, and the foundations of the world were exposed, at thy rebuke, O Lord, at the blasting of the breath of thy wrath. 
\p
\v 17 He sent from on high and took me, he drew me to himself out of many waters.

\p \x + \xo 31:1  \xt Rom. 4. 7,8.\x* Blessed \add are they\add* whose transgressions are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. 
\v 2 Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin, and in whose mouth there is no guile. 
\p
\v 3 Because I kept silence, my bones waxed old, from my crying all the day. 
\v 4 For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: I became thoroughly miserable while a \f + \fr 31:4  \ft See \fqa Heb.\f*thorn was fastened in \add me\add*. Pause. 
\v 5 I acknowledged my sin, and hid not mine iniquity: I said, I will confess mine iniquity to the Lord against myself; and thou forgavest the ungodliness of my heart. Pause. 
\v 6 Therefore shall every holy one pray to thee in a fit time: only in the deluge of many waters they shall not come nigh to him. 
\v 7 Thou art my refuge from the affliction that encompasses me; my joy, to deliver me from them that have compassed me. Pause. 
\p
\v 8 I will instruct thee and guide thee in this way wherein thou shalt go: I will fix mine eyes upon thee. 
\v 9 Be ye not as horse and mule, which have no understanding: \f + \fr 31:9  \ft See \fqa Alex. \ft ἄγξεις.\f*\add but thou must\add* constrain their jaws with bit and curb, lest they should come nigh to thee. 
\v 10 Many are the scourges of the sinner: but him that hopes in the Lord mercy shall compass about. 
\v 11 Be glad in the Lord, and exult, ye righteous: and glory, all ye that are upright in heart.

\v 1  \add A Psalm\add* of David. 
\p Rejoice in the Lord, ye righteous; praise becomes the upright. 
\v 2  \f + \fr 32:2  \ft Rather, 'confess' \fqa or \ft give thanks to.'\f*Praise the Lord on the harp; play to him on a psaltery of ten strings. 
\v 3 Sing to him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise. 
\p
\v 4 For the word of the Lord is right; and all his works are \f + \fr 32:4  \ft Rather, \fqa Gr. \ft in \fqa or \ft with faithfulness.\f*faithful. 
\v 5 He loves mercy and judgment; the earth is full of the mercy of the Lord. 
\v 6 By the word of the Lord the heavens were established; and all the host of them by the breath of his \add mouth\add*. 
\v 7 Who gathers the waters of the sea as \add in\add* a bottle; who lays up the deeps in treasuries. 
\v 8 Let all the earth fear the Lord; and let all that dwell in the world be moved because of him. 
\v 9 For he spoke, and they were made; he commanded, and they were created. 
\v 10 The Lord frustrates the counsels of the nations; he brings to nought also the reasonings of the peoples, and brings to nought the counsels of princes. 
\v 11 But the counsel of the Lord endures for ever, the thoughts of his heart from generation to generation. 
\v 12 Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord; the people whom he has chosen for his own inheritance. 
\v 13 The Lord looks out of heaven; he beholds all the sons of men. 
\v 14 He looks from his prepared habitation on all the dwellers on the earth; 
\v 15 who fashioned their hearts \f + \fr 32:15  \ft Perhaps 'individually.' \fqa Vulg. \ft sigillatim.\f*alone; who understands all their works. 
\v 16 A king is not saved by reason of a great host; and a giant shall not be delivered by the greatness of his strength. 
\v 17 A horse is vain for safety; neither shall he be delivered by the greatness of his power. 
\p
\v 18 Behold, the eyes of the Lord are on them that fear him, those that hope in his mercy; 
\v 19 to deliver their souls from death, and to keep them alive in famine. 
\v 20 Our soul waits on the Lord; for he is our helper and defender. 
\v 21 For our heart shall rejoice in him, and we have hoped in his holy name. 
\v 22 Let thy mercy, O Lord, be upon us, according as we have hoped in thee. 
\c 33  
\d
\v 1  \add A Psalm\add* of David, when he changed his countenance before Abimelech; and he let him go, and he departed. 
\p
\v 2 I will bless the Lord at all times: his praise shall be continually in my mouth. 
\v 3 My soul shall \f + \fr 33:3  \fqa Gr. \ft be praised.\f*boast herself in the Lord: let the meek hear, and rejoice. 
\v 4 Magnify ye the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together. 
\p
\v 5 I sought the Lord diligently, and he hearkened to me, and delivered me from all my \f + \fr 33:5  \fqa Lit. \ft neighbourhoods.\f*sojournings. 
\v 6 Draw near to him, and be enlightened: and your faces shall not \add by any means\add* be ashamed. 
\v 7 This poor man cried, and the Lord hearkened to him, and delivered him out of all his afflictions. 
\v 8 The angel of the Lord will encamp round about them that fear him, and will deliver them. 
\v 9 Taste and see that the Lord is good: blessed is the man who hopes in him. 
\v 10 Fear the Lord, all ye his saints: for there is no want to them that fear him. 
\v 11 The rich have become poor and hungry: but they that seek the Lord diligently shall not want any good thing. Pause. 
\p
\v 12 Come, ye children, hear me: I will teach you the fear of the Lord. 
\v 13  \x + \xo 33:13  \xt 1 Pet. 3. 10-13.\x* What man is there that desires life, loving to see good days? 
\v 14 Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile. 
\v 15 Turn away from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it. 
\p
\v 16 The eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears \add are open\add* to their prayer: 
\v 17 but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil, to destroy their memorial from the earth. The righteous cried, and the Lord hearkened to them, 
\v 18 and delivered them out of all their afflictions. 
\v 19 The Lord is near to \f + \fr 33:19  \fqa Gr. \ft the broken in heart.\f*them that are of a contrite heart; and will save the lowly in spirit. 
\v 20 Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but out of them all the Lord will deliver them. 
\v 21 He keeps all their bones: not one of them shall be broken. 
\v 22 The death of sinners is evil: and they that hate righteousness will go wrong. 
\v 23 The Lord will redeem the souls of his servants: and none of those that hope in him shall go wrong. 
\c 34  
\d
\v 1  \add A Psalm\add* of David. 
\p Judge thou, O Lord, them that injure me, fight against them that fight against me. 
\v 2 Take hold of shield and buckler, and arise for my help. 
\v 3 Bring forth a sword, and stop \add the way\add* against them that persecute me: say to my soul, I am thy salvation. 
\v 4 Let them that seek my soul be ashamed and confounded: let them that devise evils against me be turned back and put to shame. 
\v 5 Let them be as dust before the wind, and an angel of the Lord afflicting them. 
\v 6 Let their way be dark and slippery, and an angel of the Lord persecuting them. 
\v 7 For without cause they have hid for me their destructive snare: without a cause they have reproached my soul. 
\p
\v 8 Let a snare which they know not come upon them: and the gin which they hid take them; and let them fall into the very same snare. 
\v 9 But my soul shall exult in the Lord: it shall delight in his salvation. 
\v 10 All my bones shall say, O Lord, who is like to thee? delivering the poor out of the hand of them that are stronger than he, yea, the poor and needy one from them that spoil him. 
\p
\v 11 Unjust witnesses arose, and asked me of things I knew not. 
\v 12 They rewarded me evil for good, and bereavement to my soul. 
\v 13 But I, when they troubled me, put on sackcloth, and humbled my soul with fasting: and my prayer shall return to my \add own\add* bosom. 
\v 14 I behaved agreeably towards them as \add if it had been\add* our neighbour \add or\add* brother: I humbled myself as one mourning and sad of countenance. 
\v 15 Yet they rejoiced against me, and plagues were \f + \fr 34:15  \ft The \fqa Gr. \ft is repeated, by a \fqa Hebraism.\f*plentifully brought against me, and I knew \add it\add* not: they were scattered, but \f + \fr 34:15  \ft See \xt Acts 2. 37.\f*repented not. 
\v 16 They tempted me, they sneered at me most contemptuously, they gnashed their teeth upon me. 
\p
\v 17 O Lord, when wilt thou look upon me? Deliver my soul from their mischief, mine only-begotten one from the lions. 
\v 18 I will give thanks to thee even in a great congregation: in an abundant people I will praise thee. 
\v 19 Let not them that are mine enemies without a cause rejoice against me; who hate me for nothing, and wink with their eyes. 
\v 20 For to me they spoke peaceably, but imagined deceits in \add their\add* anger. 
\v 21 And they opened wide their mouth upon me; they said, Aha, aha, our eyes have seen \add it\add*. 
\p
\v 22 Thou hast seen \add it\add*, O Lord: keep not silence: O Lord, withdraw not \add thyself\add* from me. 
\v 23 Awake, O Lord, and attend to my judgment, \add even\add* to my cause, my God and my Lord. 
\v 24 Judge me, O Lord, according to thy righteousness, O Lord my God; and let them not rejoice against me. 
\v 25 Let them not say in their hearts, Aha, aha, \add it is pleasing\add* to our soul: neither let them say, We have devoured him. 
\v 26 Let them be confounded and ashamed together that rejoice at my afflictions: let them be clothed with shame and confusion that speak great swelling words against me. 
\v 27 Let them that rejoice in my righteousness exult and be glad: and let them say continually, The Lord be magnified, who desire the peace of his servant. 
\v 28 And my tongue shall meditate on thy righteousness, \add and\add* on thy praise all the day.

\v 1 For the end, by David the servant of the Lord. 
\p
\v 2 The transgressor, that he may sin, says within himself, \add that\add* \x + \xo 35:2  \xt Rom. 3. 18.\x* there is no fear of God before his eyes. 
\v 3 For he has dealt craftily before him, \f + \fr 35:3  \fqa q. d. \ft with regard to the discovering.\f*to discover his iniquity and hate it. 
\v 4 The words of his mouth are transgression and deceit: he is not inclined to understand \add how\add* to do good. 
\v 5 He devises iniquity on his bed; he gives himself to every evil way; and does not abhor evil. 
\p
\v 6 O Lord, thy mercy is in the heaven; and thy truth \add reaches\add* to the clouds. 
\v 7 Thy righteousness is as the \f + \fr 35:7  \fqa Or, \ft vast mountains.\f*mountains of God, thy judgments are as a great deep: O Lord, thou wilt preserve men and beasts. 
\v 8 How hast thou multiplied thy mercy, O God! so the children of men shall trust in the shelter of thy wings. 
\v 9 They shall be \f + \fr 35:9  \fqa Gr. \ft intoxicated.\f*fully satisfied with the fatness of thine house; and thou shalt cause them to drink of the full stream of thy delights. 
\v 10 For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light we shall see light. 
\p
\v 11 Extend thy mercy to them that know thee; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart. 
\v 12 Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of sinners move me. 
\p
\v 13 There have all the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast out, and shall not be able to stand. 
\c 36  
\d
\v 1  \add A Psalm\add* of David. 
\p Fret not thyself because of evil-doers, neither be envious of them that do iniquity. 
\v 2 For they shall soon be withered as the grass, and shall soon fall away as the green herbs. 
\v 3 Hope in the Lord, and do good; and dwell on the land, and thou shalt be fed with the wealth of it. 
\v 4 Delight \add thyself\add* in the Lord; and he shall grant thee the requests of thine heart. 
\v 5 Disclose thy way to the Lord, and hope in him; and he shall bring \add it\add* to pass. 
\v 6 And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noon-day. 
\p
\v 7 Submit thyself to the Lord, and supplicate him: fret not thyself because of him that prospers in his way, at the man that does unlawful deeds. 
\v 8 Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself so as to do evil. 
\v 9 For evil-doers shall be destroyed: but they that wait on the Lord, they shall inherit the land. 
\v 10 And yet a little while, and the sinner shall not be, and thou shalt seek for his place, and shalt not find \add it\add*. 
\v 11 But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight \add themselves\add* in the abundance of peace. 
\p
\v 12 The sinner will watch for the righteous, and gnash his teeth upon him. 
\v 13 But the Lord shall laugh at him: for he foresees that his day will come. 
\v 14 Sinners have drawn their swords, they have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy one, \add and\add* to slay the upright in heart. 
\v 15 Let their sword enter into their \add own\add* heart, and their bows be broken. 
\p
\v 16 A little is better to the righteous than abundant wealth of sinners. 
\v 17 For the arms of sinners shall be broken; but the Lord supports the righteous. 
\p
\v 18 The Lord knows the ways of the perfect; and their inheritance shall be for ever. 
\v 19 They shall not be ashamed in an evil time; and in days of famine they shall be satisfied. 
\v 20 For the sinners shall perish; and the enemies of the Lord at the moment of their being honoured and exalted have utterly vanished like smoke. 
\v 21 The sinner borrows, and will not pay again: but the righteous has compassion, and gives. 
\v 22 For they that bless him shall inherit the earth; and they that curse him shall be utterly destroyed. 
\p
\v 23 The steps of a man are rightly ordered by the Lord: and he will take pleasure in his way. 
\v 24 When he falls, he shall not be ruined: for the Lord supports his hand. 
\v 25 I was \add once\add* young, indeed I am now old; yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed seeking bread. 
\v 26 He is merciful, and lends continually; and his seed shall be \f + \fr 36:26  \fqa Gr. \ft for a blessing.\f*blessed. 
\p
\v 27 Turn aside from evil, and do good; and dwell for ever. 
\v 28 For the Lord loves judgment, and will not forsake his saints; they shall be preserved for ever: the blameless shall be \f + \fr 36:28  \fqa Or, \ft cleared in judgement.\f*avenged, but the seed of the ungodly shall be utterly destroyed. 
\v 29 But the righteous shall inherit the earth, and dwell upon it for ever. 
\p
\v 30 The mouth of the righteous will meditate wisdom, and his tongue will speak of judgment. 
\v 31 The law of his God is in his heart; and his steps shall not \f + \fr 36:31  \fqa Gr. \ft be tripped up, or supplanted.\f*slide. 
\v 32 The sinner watches the righteous, and seeks to slay him. 
\v 33 But the Lord will not leave him in his hands, nor by any means condemn him when he is judged. 
\v 34 Wait on the Lord, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are destroyed, thou shalt see \add it\add*. 
\p
\v 35 I saw the ungodly very highly exalting himself, and lifting himself up like the cedars of Libanus. 
\v 36 Yet I passed by, and lo! he was not: and I sought him, but his place was not found. 
\v 37 Maintain innocence, and behold uprightness: for there is a remnant to the peaceable man. 
\v 38 But the transgressors shall be utterly destroyed together: the remnants of the ungodly shall be utterly destroyed. 
\v 39 But the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord; and he is their defender in the time of affliction. 
\v 40 And the Lord shall help them, and deliver them: and he shall rescue them from sinners, and save them, because they have hoped in him. 
\c 37  
\d
\v 1 A Psalm of David for remembrance concerning the Sabbath-day. 
\p
\v 2 O Lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath, neither chasten me in thine anger. 
\v 3 For thy weapons are fixed in me, and thou hast pressed thy hand heavily upon me. 
\p
\v 4 For there is no health in my flesh because of thine anger; there is no peace to my bones because of my sins. 
\v 5 For my transgressions have gone over mine head: they have pressed heavily upon me like a weighty burden. 
\v 6 My bruises have become noisome and corrupt, because of my foolishness. 
\v 7 I have been wretched and bowed down continually: I went with a mourning countenance all the day. 
\v 8 For my soul is filled with mockings; and there is no health in my flesh. 
\v 9 I have been afflicted and brought down exceedingly: I have roared for the groaning of my heart. 
\p
\v 10 But all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hidden from thee. 
\v 11 My heart is troubled, my strength has failed me; and the light of mine eyes is not with me. 
\v 12 My friends and my neighbours drew near before me, and stood still; and my nearest of kin stood afar off. 
\v 13 While they pressed hard upon me that sought my soul: and they that sought my hurt spoke vanities, and devised deceits all the day. 
\v 14 But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and was as a dumb man not opening his mouth. 
\v 15 And I was as a man that hears not, and who has no reproofs in his mouth. 
\p
\v 16 For I hoped in thee, O Lord: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God. 
\v 17 For I said, Lest mine enemies rejoice against me: for when my feet were moved, they spoke boastingly against me. 
\v 18 For I am ready for \f + \fr 37:18  \fqa Gr. \ft scourges.\f*plagues, and my grief is continually before me. 
\v 19 For I will declare mine iniquity, and be distressed for my sin. 
\v 20 But mine enemies live, and are mightier than I: and they that hate me unjustly are multiplied. 
\v 21 They that reward evil for good slandered me; because I followed righteousness. 
\v 22 Forsake me not, O Lord my God: depart not from me. 
\v 23 Draw nigh to my help, O Lord of my salvation. 
\c 38

\v 1 For the end, a Song of David, to Idithun. 
\p
\v 2 I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I set a guard on my mouth, while the sinner stood in my presence. 
\v 3 I was dumb, and humbled myself, and kept silence from good \add words\add*; and my grief was renewed. 
\v 4 My heart grew hot within me, and a fire would kindle in my meditation: I spoke with my tongue, 
\p
\v 5 O Lord, make me to know mine end, and the number of my days, what it is; that I may know what I lack. 
\v 6 Behold, thou hast made my days \f + \fr 38:6  \fqa Alex. \ft a span long.\f*old; and my existence \add is\add* as nothing before thee: nay, every man living \add is\add* altogether vanity. Pause. 
\v 7 Surely man walks in a \f + \fr 38:7  \fqa Gr. \ft image.\f*shadow; nay, he is disquieted in vain: he lays up treasures, and knows not for whom he shall gather them. 
\p
\v 8 And now what \add is\add* my expectation? \add is it\add* not the Lord? and my ground \add of hope\add* is with thee. Pause. 
\v 9 Deliver me from all my transgressions: thou hast made me a reproach to the foolish. 
\v 10 I was \f + \fr 38:10  \fqa Gr. \ft made dumb.\f*dumb, and opened not my mouth; for thou art he that made me. 
\v 11 Remove thy scourges from me: I have fainted by reason of the strength of thine hand. 
\v 12 Thou chastenest man with rebukes for iniquity, and thou makest his life to consume away like a spider's web: nay, every man is disquieted in vain. Pause. 
\p
\v 13 O Lord, hearken to my prayer and my supplication: attend to my tears: be not silent, for I am a sojourner in the land, and a stranger, as all my fathers \add were\add*. 
\v 14 Spare me, that I may be refreshed, before I depart, and be no more. 
\c 39  
\d
\v 1 For the end, a Psalm of David. 
\p
\v 2 I waited patiently for the Lord; and he attended to me, and hearkened to my supplication. 
\v 3 And he brought me up out of a pit of misery, and from miry clay: and he set my feet on a rock, and ordered my goings aright. 
\v 4 And he put a new song into my mouth, \add even\add* a hymn to our God: many shall see \add it\add*, and fear, and shall hope in the Lord. 
\v 5 Blessed \add is\add* the man whose hope is the name of the Lord, and \add who\add* has not regarded vanities and false frenzies. 
\p
\v 6 O Lord my God, thou hast multiplied thy wonderful works, and in thy thoughts there is none who shall be likened to thee: I declared and spoke \add of them\add*: they exceeded number. 
\v 7  \x + \xo 39:7  \xt Heb. 10. 5,6.\x* Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not; but a body hast thou prepared me: whole-burnt-offering and \add sacrifice\add* for sin thou didst not require. 
\v 8 Then I said, Behold, I \f + \fr 39:8  \fqa Or, \ft am come.\f*come: in the volume of the book it is written concerning me, 
\v 9 I desired to do thy will, O my God, and thy law in the midst of mine heart. 
\v 10 I have preached righteousness in the great congregation; lo! I will not refrain my lips; O Lord, thou knowest my righteousness. 
\v 11 I have not hid thy truth within my heart, and I have declared thy salvation; I have not hid thy mercy and thy truth from the great congregation. 
\p
\v 12 But thou, Lord, remove not thy compassion far from me; thy mercy and thy truth have helped me continually. 
\v 13 For innumerable evils have encompassed me; my transgressions have taken hold of me, and I could not see; they are multiplied more than the hairs of my head; and my heart has failed me. 
\v 14 Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me; O Lord, draw nigh to help me. 
\v 15 Let those that seek my soul, to destroy it, be ashamed and confounded together; let those that wish me evil be turned backward and put to shame. 
\v 16 Let those that say to me, Aha, aha, quickly receive shame for their reward. 
\v 17 Let all those that seek thee, O Lord, exult and rejoice in thee; and let them that love thy salvation say continually, The Lord be magnified. 
\v 18 But I am poor and needy; the Lord will take care of me; thou art my helper, and my defender, O my God, delay not.

\v 3 May the Lord preserve him and keep him alive, and bless him on the earth, and not deliver him into the hands of his enemy. 
\v 4 May the Lord help him upon the bed of his pain; thou hast made all his bed in his sickness. 
\p
\v 5 I said, O Lord, have mercy upon me; heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee. 
\v 6 Mine enemies have spoken evil against me, \add saying\add*, When shall he die, and his name perish? 
\v 7 And if he came to see \add me\add*, his heart spoke vainly; he gathered iniquity to himself; he went forth and spoke in like manner. 
\v 8 All my enemies whispered against me; against me they devised my hurt. 
\v 9 They denounced a wicked word against me, \add saying\add*, Now that he lies, shall he not rise up again? 
\v 10 For even the man of my peace, in whom I trusted, \x + \xo 40:10  \xt John 13. 18.\x* who ate my bread, lifted up \add his\add* heel against me. 
\p
\v 11 But thou, O Lord, have compassion upon me, and raise me up, and I shall requite them. 
\v 12 By this I know that thou hast delighted in me, because mine enemy shall not rejoice over me. 
\v 13 But thou didst help me because of \add mine\add* innocence, and hast established me before thee for ever.

\v 2 As the hart earnestly desires the fountains of water, so my soul earnestly longs for thee, O God. 
\v 3 My soul has thirsted for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God?

\v 2 O God, we have heard with our ears, our fathers have told us, the work which thou wroughtest in their days, in the days of old. 
\v 3 Thine hand utterly destroyed the heathen, and thou didst plant them: thou didst afflict the nations, and cast them out. 
\v 4 For they inherited not the land by their \add own\add* sword, and their \add own\add* arm did not deliver them; but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou wert well pleased in them. 
\p
\v 5 Thou art indeed my King and my God, who commandest deliverances for Jacob. 
\v 6 In thee will we push down our enemies, and in thy name will we bring to nought them that rise up against us. 
\v 7 For I will not trust in my bow, and my sword shall not save me. 
\v 8 For thou hast saved us from them that afflicted us, and hast put to shame them that hated us. 
\v 9 In God \f + \fr 43:9  \fqa Gr. \ft will be praised etc. See \xt Ps. 106.\f*will we make our boast all the day, and to thy name will we give thanks for ever. Pause. 
\p
\v 10 But now thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and thou wilt not go forth with our hosts. 
\v 11 Thou hast turned us back before our enemies; and they that hated us spoiled for themselves. 
\v 12 Thou madest us as sheep for meat; and thou scatteredst us among the nations. 
\v 13 Thou hast sold thy people without price, and there was no profit by their exchange. 
\v 14 Thou hast made us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us. 
\v 15 Thou hast made us a proverb among the Gentiles, a shaking of the head among the nations. 
\v 16 All the day my shame is before me, and the confusion of my face has covered me, 
\v 17 because of the voice of the slanderer and reviler; because of the enemy and avenger. 
\p
\v 18 All these things are come upon us: but we have not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt unrighteously in thy covenant. 
\v 19 And our heart has not gone back; but thou hast turned aside our paths from thy way. 
\v 20 For thou hast laid us low in a place of affliction, and the shadow of death has covered us. 
\v 21 If we have forgotten the name of our God, and if we have spread out our hands to a strange god; shall not God search these things out? 
\v 22 for he knows the secrets of the heart. 
\v 23  \x + \xo 43:23  \xt Rom. 8. 36.\x* For, for thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for slaughter. 
\p
\v 24 Awake, wherefore sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, and do not cast \add us\add* off for ever. 
\v 25 Wherefore turnest thou thy face away, \add and\add* forgettest our poverty and our affliction? 
\v 26 For our soul has been brought down to the dust; our belly has cleaved to the earth. 
\v 27 Arise, O Lord, help us, and redeem us for thy name's sake.

\p
\v 2 My heart \f + \fr 44:2  \fqa Lit. \ft eructavit.\f*has uttered a good matter: I declare my works to the king: my tongue is the pen of a quick writer. 
\v 3 Thou art more beautiful than the sons of men: grace has been shed forth on thy lips: therefore God has blessed thee for ever. 
\p
\v 4 Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O Mighty One, in thy comeliness, and in thy beauty; 
\v 5 and bend \add thy bow\add*, and prosper, and reign, because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall guide thee wonderfully. 
\v 6 Thy weapons are sharpened, Mighty One, (the nations shall fall under thee) \add they are\add* in the heart of the king's enemies. 
\p
\v 7  \x + \xo 44:7  \xt Heb. 1. 8-10.\x* Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a sceptre of righteousness. 
\v 8 Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity: therefore God, thy God, has anointed thee with the oil of gladness beyond thy fellows. 
\p
\v 9 Myrrh, and stacte, and cassia \add are exhaled\add* from thy garments, \add and\add* out of the ivory palaces, 
\v 10 with which kings' daughters have gladdened thee for thine honour: the queen stood by on thy right hand, clothed in vesture wrought with gold, \add and\add* arrayed in divers colours. 
\v 11 Hear, O daughter, and see, and incline thine ear; forget also thy people, and thy father's house. 
\v 12 Because the king has desired thy beauty; for he is thy Lord. 
\v 13 And the daughter of Tyre shall adore him with gifts; the rich of the people of the land shall supplicate thy \f + \fr 44:13  \fqa Gr. \ft face.\f*favour. 
\p
\v 14 All her glory \add is that\add* of the daughter of the king \f + \fr 44:14  \fqa Alex. \ft ἔσωθεν, within, so \fqa Heb.\f*of Esebon, robed \add as she is\add* in golden fringed garments, 
\v 15 in embroidered \add clothing\add*: virgins shall be brought to the king after her: her fellows shall be brought to thee. 
\v 16 They shall be brought with gladness and exultation: they shall be led into the king's temple. 
\v 17 Instead of thy fathers children are born to thee: thou shalt make them princes over all the earth. 
\v 18 They shall make mention of thy name from generation to generation: therefore shall the nations give thanks to thee \f + \fr 44:18  \fqa Gr. \ft to the age of the age.\f*for ever, even for ever and ever.

\v 1 For the end, for the sons of Core; a Psalm concerning secret things. 
\p
\v 2 God is our refuge and strength, a help in the afflictions that have come heavily upon us. 
\v 3 Therefore will we not fear when the earth is troubled, and the mountains are removed into the depths of the seas. 
\v 4 Their waters have roared and been troubled, the mountains have been troubled by his might. Pause. 
\v 5 The flowings of the river gladden the city of God: the Most High has sanctified his tabernacle. 
\v 6 God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her \f + \fr 45:6  \fqa Alex. \ft and \fqa Heb. \ft before, \fqa or, \ft toward the morning.\f*with his countenance. 
\v 7 The nations were troubled, the kingdoms tottered: he uttered his voice, the earth shook. 
\v 8 The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our helper. Pause. 
\p
\v 9 Come, and behold the works of the Lord, what wonders he has achieved on the earth. 
\v 10 Putting an end to wars as for the ends of the earth; he will crush the bow, and break in pieces the weapon, and burn the bucklers with fire. 
\v 11 Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth. 
\v 12 The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our helper. 
\c 46  
\d
\v 1 For the end, a Psalm for the sons of Core. 
\p
\v 2 Clap your hands, all ye nations; shout to God with a voice of exultation. 
\v 3 For the Lord most high is terrible; \add he is\add* a great king over all the earth. 
\v 4 He has subdued the peoples under us, and the nations under our feet. 
\v 5 He has chosen out his inheritance for us, the beauty of Jacob which he loved. Pause. 
\p
\v 6 God is gone up with a shout, the Lord with a sound of a trumpet. 
\v 7 Sing praises to our God, sing praises: sing praises to our King, sing praises. 
\v 8 For God is king of all the earth: sing praises with understanding. 
\v 9 God reigns over the nations: God sits upon the throne of his holiness. 
\v 10 The rulers of the people are assembled with the God of Abraam: for God's mighty ones of the earth have been greatly exalted.

\d
\v 1 A Psalm of \f + \fr 47:1  \ft A song.\f*praise for the sons of Core on the second \add day\add* of the week. 
\p
\v 2 Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in his holy mountain. 
\v 3 The city of the great King is well planted \add on\add* the mountains of Sion, with the joy of the whole earth, \add on\add* the sides of the north. 
\v 4 God is known in her palaces, when he undertakes to help her. 
\p
\v 5 For, behold, the kings of the earth were assembled, they came together. 
\v 6 They saw, and so they wondered: they were troubled, they were moved. 
\v 7 Trembling took hold on them: there were the pangs as of a woman in travail. 
\v 8 Thou wilt break the ships of Tharsis with a vehement wind. 
\v 9 As we have heard, so have we also seen, in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God: God has founded it for ever. Pause. 
\p
\v 10 We have thought of thy mercy, O God, in the midst of thy people. 
\v 11 According to thy name, O God, so is also thy praise to the ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness. 
\v 12 Let mount Sion rejoice, let the daughters of Judæa exult, because of thy judgments, O Lord. 
\p
\v 13 Go round about Sion, and encompass her: tell ye her towers. 
\v 14 Mark ye well her strength, and observe her palaces; that ye may tell the next generation. 
\v 15 For this is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide for evermore.

\v 1 For the end, a Psalm for the sons of Core. 
\p
\v 2 Hear these words, all ye nations, hearken, all ye that dwell upon the earth: 
\v 3 both the \f + \fr 48:3  \fqa Gr. \ft earth-born.\f*sons of mean men, and sons of \add great\add* men; the rich and poor \add man\add* together. 
\v 4 My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall bring \add forth\add* understanding. 
\v 5 I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my \f + \fr 48:5  \fqa Gr. \ft problem.\f*riddle on the harp. 
\p
\v 6 Wherefore \f + \fr 48:6  \fqa Gr. \ft shall.\f*should I fear in the evil day? the iniquity of my heel shall compass me. 
\v 7 They that trust in their strength, and boast themselves in the multitude of their wealth— 
\v 8 A brother does not redeem, shall a man redeem? he shall not give to God a ransom for himself, 
\v 9 or the price of the redemption of his soul, though he labour for ever, 
\v 10 and live to the end, \add so\add* that he should not see corruption. 
\p
\v 11 When he shall see wise men dying, the fool and the senseless one shall perish together; and they shall leave their wealth to strangers. 
\v 12 And their sepulchres are their houses for ever, \add even\add* their tabernacles to all generations: they have called their lands after their own names. 
\v 13 And man being in honour, understands not: he is compared to the senseless cattle, and is like to them. 
\v 14 This their way is an offence to them: yet afterwards men will commend their sayings. Pause. 
\v 15 They have laid \add them\add* as sheep in Hades; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning, and their help shall fail in Hades from their glory. 
\v 16 But God shall deliver my soul from the power of Hades, when he shall receive me. Pause. 
\p
\v 17 Fear not when a man is enriched, and when the glory of his house is increased. 
\v 18 For he shall take nothing when he dies; neither shall his glory descend with him. 
\v 19 For his soul shall be blessed in his life: he shall give thanks to thee when thou dost well to him. 
\v 20  \add Yet\add* he shall go in \f + \fr 48:20  \fqa Gr. \ft as far as.\f*to the generation of his fathers; he shall never see light. 
\v 21 Man that is in honour, understands not: he is compared to the senseless cattle, and is like them.

\d
\v 1 A Psalm \f + \fr 49:1  \fqa Or, \ft of.\f*for Asaph. 
\p The God of gods, the Lord, has spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun to the going down \add thereof\add*. 
\v 2 Out of Sion \add comes\add* the excellence of his beauty. 
\v 3 God, our God, shall come manifestly, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall be kindled before him, and round about him there shall be a very great tempest. 
\v 4 He shall summon the heaven above, and the earth, that he may \x + \xo 49:4  \xt Heb. 10. 30.\x* judge his people. 
\v 5 Assemble ye his saints to him, those that have engaged in a covenant with him upon sacrifices. 
\v 6 And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is judge. Pause. 
\p
\v 7 Hear, my people, and I will speak to thee, O Israel: and I will testify to thee: I am God, thy God. 
\v 8 I will not reprove thee on account of thy sacrifices; for thy whole-burnt-offerings are before me continually. 
\v 9 I will take no bullocks out of thine house, nor he-goats out of thy flocks. 
\v 10 For all the wild beasts of the thicket are mine, the cattle on the mountains, and oxen. 
\v 11 I know all the birds of the sky; and the beauty of the field is mine. 
\v 12 If I should be hungry, I will not tell thee: for the world is mine, and the fulness of it. 
\v 13 Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats? 
\v 14 Offer to God the sacrifice of praise; and pay thy vows to the Most High. 
\v 15 And call upon me in the day of affliction; and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me. Pause. 
\p
\v 16 But to the sinner God has said, Why dost thou declare my ordinances, and take up my covenant in thy mouth? 
\v 17 Whereas thou hast hated instruction, and hast cast my words behind \add thee\add*. 
\v 18 If thou sawest a thief, thou \f + \fr 49:18  \ft See 1 Pe 4. 4.\f*rannest along with him, and hast cast in thy lot with adulterers. 
\v 19 Thy mouth has multiplied wickedness, and thy tongue has framed deceit.\f + \fr 49:19  \ft From these words in \fqa Alex. \ft to \xt Ps. 79. 11, \ft thirty psalms are wanting.\f* 
\v 20 Thou didst sit and speak against thy brother, and didst scandalise thy mother's son. 
\p
\v 21 These things thou didst, and I kept silence: thou thoughtest wickedly that I should be like thee; \add but\add* I will reprove thee, and set \add thine offences\add* before thee. 
\v 22 Now consider these things, ye that forget God, lest he rend \add you\add*, and there be no deliverer. 
\p
\v 23 The sacrifice of praise will glorify me: and \f + \fr 49:23  \fqa Gr. \ft there.\f*that is the way wherein I will shew to him the salvation of God.

\d
\v 1 For the end, a Psalm of David, 
\v 2 when Nathan the prophet came to him, when he had gone in to Bersabee. 
\p
\v 3 Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy great mercy; and according to the multitude of thy compassions blot out my transgression. 
\v 4 Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. 
\p
\v 5 For I am conscious of mine iniquity; and my sin is continually before me. 
\v 6 Against thee only have I sinned, and done evil before thee: that thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged. 
\v 7 For, behold, I was conceived in iniquities, and in sins did my mother conceive me. 
\p
\v 8 For, behold, thou lovest truth: thou hast manifested to me the secret and hidden things of thy wisdom. 
\v 9 Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be purified: thou shalt wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow. 
\v 10 Thou shalt cause me to hear gladness and joy: the afflicted bones shall rejoice. 
\v 11 Turn away thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities. 
\v 12 Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit in my inward parts. 
\v 13 Cast me not away from thy presence; and remove not thy Holy Spirit from me. 
\v 14 Restore to me the joy of thy salvation: establish me with thy \f + \fr 50:14  \fqa Gr. \ft governing.\f*directing Spirit. 
\p
\v 15  \add Then\add* will I teach transgressors thy ways; and ungodly men shall turn to thee. 
\v 16 Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, the God of my salvation: \add and\add* my tongue shall joyfully declare thy righteousness. 
\v 17 O Lord, thou shalt open my lips; and my mouth shall declare thy praise. 
\v 18 For if thou desiredst sacrifice, I would have given \add it\add*: thou wilt not take pleasure in whole-burnt-offerings. 
\v 19 Sacrifice to God is a broken spirit: a broken and humbled heart God will not despise. 
\p
\v 20 Do good, O Lord, to Sion in thy good pleasure; and let the walls of Jerusalem be built. 
\v 21 Then shalt thou be pleased with a sacrifice of righteousness, \f + \fr 50:21  \ft Properly, a heave or wave-offfering.\f*offering, and whole-burnt-sacrifices: then shall they offer calves upon thine altar. 
\c 51  
\d
\v 1 For the end, \add a Psalm\add* of \f + \fr 51:1  \fqa Gr. \ft governing.\f*instruction by David, 
\v 2 when Doec the Idumean came and told Saul, and said to him, David is gone to the house of Abimelech. 
\p
\v 3 Why dost thou, O mighty man, boast of iniquity in \add thy\add* mischief? All the day 
\v 4 thy tongue has devised unrighteousness; like a sharpened razor thou hast wrought deceit. 
\v 5 Thou hast loved wickedness more than goodness; unrighteousness better than to speak righteousness. Pause. 
\v 6 Thou hast loved all words of destruction, \add and\add* a deceitful tongue. 
\p
\v 7 Therefore may God destroy thee for ever, may he pluck thee up and utterly remove thee from \add thy\add* dwelling, and thy root from the land of the living. Pause. 
\v 8 And the righteous shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him, and say, 
\v 9 Behold the man who made not God his help; but trusted in the abundance of his wealth, and strengthened himself in his vanity. 
\p
\v 10 But I am as a fruitful olive in the house of God: I have trusted in the mercy of God for ever, even for evermore. 
\v 11 I will give thanks to thee for ever, for thou hast done \add it\add*: and I will wait on thy name; for \add it is\add* good before thy saints. 
\c 52  
\d
\v 1 For the end, \add a Psalm\add* of David upon Maeleth, of instruction. 
\p
\v 2 The fool has said in his heart, There is no God. They have corrupted \add themselves\add*, and become abominable in iniquities: there is none that does good. 
\v 3 God looked down from heaven upon the sons of men, to see if there were any that understood, or sought after God. 
\v 4  \x + \xo 52:4  \xt Rom. 3. 10-12.\x* They have all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that does good, there is not even one. 
\p
\v 5 Will none of the workers of iniquity know, who devour my people as they would eat bread? they have not called upon God. There were they greatly afraid, where there was no fear: 
\v 6 for God has scattered the bones of the men-pleasers; they were ashamed, for God despised them. 
\v 7 Who will bring the salvation of Israel out of Sion? When the Lord turns the captivity of his people, Jacob shall exult, and Israel shall be glad. 
\c 53  
\d
\v 1 For the end, among the Hymns of instruction by David, 
\v 2 when the Ziphites came and said to Saul, Lo, is not David hid with us? 
\p
\v 3 Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy might. 
\v 4 O God, hear my prayer; hearken to the words of my mouth. 
\v 5 For strangers have risen up against me, and mighty men have sought my life: they have not set God before them. Pause. 
\p
\v 6 For lo! God assists me; and the Lord is the helper of my soul. 
\v 7 He shall return evil to mine enemies; utterly destroy them in thy truth. 
\v 8 I will willingly sacrifice to thee: I will give thanks to thy name, O Lord; for \add it is\add* good. 
\v 9 For thou hast delivered me out of all affliction, and mine eye has seen \add my desire\add* upon mine enemies. 
\c 54  
\d
\v 1 For the end, among Hymns of instruction by David. 
\p
\v 2 Hearken, O God, to my prayer; and disregard not my supplication. 
\v 3 Attend to me, and hearken to me: I was grieved in my meditation, and troubled; 
\v 4 because of the voice of the enemy, and because of the oppression of the sinner: for they brought iniquity against me, and were wrathfully angry with me. 
\p
\v 5 My heart was troubled within me; and the fear of death fell upon me. 
\v 6 Fear and trembling came upon me, and darkness covered me. 
\v 7 And I said, O that I had wings as \add those\add* of a dove! then would I flee away, and be at rest. 
\v 8 Lo! I have fled afar off, and lodged in the wilderness. Pause. 
\v 9 I waited for him that should deliver me from distress of spirit and tempest. 
\p
\v 10 Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen iniquity and gainsaying in the city. 
\v 11 Day and night \f + \fr 54:11  \fqa Or, \ft it, \fqa sc. \ft iniquity.\f*he shall go round about it upon its walls: iniquity and sorrow and unrighteousness \add are\add* in the midst of it; 
\v 12 and usury and craft have not failed from its streets. 
\p
\v 13 For if an enemy had reproached me, I would have endured it; and if one who hated \add me\add* had spoken vauntingly against me, I would have hid myself from him. 
\v 14 But thou, O man likeminded, my guide, and my acquaintance, 
\v 15 who in companionship with me sweetened \add our\add* food: we walked in the house of God in concord. 
\v 16 Let death come upon them, and let them go down alive into Hades, for iniquity is in their dwellings, in the midst of them. 
\p
\v 17 I cried to God, and the Lord hearkened to me. 
\v 18 Evening, and morning, and at noon I will declare and make known \add my wants\add*: and he shall hear my voice. 
\v 19 He shall deliver my soul in peace from them that draw nigh to me: for they were with me in many \add cases\add*. 
\v 20 God shall hear, and bring them low, \add even\add* he that has existed from eternity. Pause. 
\p \f + \fr 54:20  \fqa Or, \ft they have nothing to give in exchange, \fqa q. d. \ft to redeem their souls. Compare \xt Ps. 48. 7,8; Mark 8. 37.\f*For they suffer no reverse, and \add therefore\add* they have not feared God. 
\v 21 He has reached forth his hand for retribution; they have profaned his covenant. 
\v 22 They were scattered at the anger of his countenance, and his heart drew nigh \f + \fr 54:22  \ft Compare \fqa Heb. \ft and \fqa A. V.\f*them. His words were smoother than oil, yet are they darts. 
\p
\v 23  \x + \xo 54:23  \xt 1 Pet. 5. 7.\x* Cast thy care upon the Lord, and he shall \f + \fr 54:23  \fqa Or, \ft nourish.\f*sustain thee; he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved. 
\v 24 But thou, O God, shalt bring them down to the pit of destruction; bloody and crafty men shall not live out half their days; but I will hope in thee, O Lord. 
\c 55  
\d
\v 1 For the end, concerning the people that were removed from the \f + \fr 55:1  \fqa Or, \ft holy things.\f*sanctuary, by David for a memorial, when the Philistines caught him in Geth. 
\p
\v 2 Have mercy upon me, O God; for man has trodden me down; all the day long he warring has afflicted me. 
\v 3 Mine enemies have trodden me down all the day from the dawning of the day; for there are many warring against me. 
\p
\v 4 They shall be afraid, but I will trust in thee. 
\v 5 In God I will praise my words; all the day have I hoped in God; I will not fear what flesh shall do to me. 
\p
\v 6 All the day long they have abominated my words; all their devices \add are\add* against me for evil. 
\v 7 They will dwell near and hide \add themselves\add*; they will watch my steps, accordingly as I have waited patiently in my soul. 
\v 8 Thou wilt on no account save them; thou wilt bring down the people in wrath. 
\v 9 O God, I have declared my life to thee; thou hast set my tears before thee, even according to thy promise. 
\p
\v 10 Mine enemies shall be turned back, in the day wherein I shall call upon thee; behold, I know that thou art my God. 
\v 11 In God will I praise \add his\add* word; in the Lord will I praise \add his\add* saying. 
\v 12 I have hoped in God; I will not be afraid of what man shall do to me. 
\v 13 The vows of thy praise, O God, which I will pay, are upon me. 
\v 14 For thou hast delivered my soul from death, and my feet from sliding, that I should be well-pleasing before God in the land of the living. 
\c 56  
\d
\v 1 For the end. Destroy not: by David, for a memorial, when he fled from the presence of Saul to the cave. 
\p
\v 2 Have mercy, upon me, O God, have mercy upon me: for my soul has trusted in thee: and in the shadow of thy wings will I hope, until the iniquity have passed away. 
\v 3 I will cry to God most high; the God who has benefited me. Pause. 
\v 4 He sent from heaven and saved me; he gave to reproach them that trampled on me: God has sent forth his mercy and his truth; 
\v 5 and he has delivered my soul from the midst of \add lions'\add* whelps: I lay down to sleep, \add though\add* troubled. \add As for\add* the sons of men, their teeth are arms and \add missile\add* weapons, and their tongue a sharp sword. 
\p
\v 6 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; and thy glory above all the earth. 
\v 7 They have prepared snares for my feet, and have bowed down my soul: they have dug a pit before my face, and fallen into it \add themselves\add*. Pause. 
\v 8 My heart, O God, \add is\add* ready, my heart \add is\add* ready: I will sing, yea will sing psalms. 
\v 9 Awake, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I will awake early. 
\v 10 O Lord, I will give thanks to thee among the nations: I will sing to thee among the Gentiles. 
\v 11 For thy mercy has been magnified even to the heavens, and thy truth to the clouds. 
\v 12 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; and thy glory above all the earth.

\v 1 For the end. Destroy not: by David, for a memorial.

\v 19 even thy power and thy righteousness, O God, up to the highest \add heavens, even\add* the mighty works which thou hast done: O God, who is like to thee? 
\p
\v 20 What afflictions many and sore hast thou shewed me! yet thou didst turn and quicken me, and broughtest me again from the depths of the earth. 
\v 21 Thou didst multiply thy righteousness, and didst turn and comfort me, and broughtest me again out of the depths of the earth. 
\v 22 I will also therefore give thanks to thee, O God, \add because of\add* thy truth, on an instrument of psalmody: I will sing psalms to thee on the harp, O Holy One of Israel. 
\v 23 My lips shall rejoice when I sing to thee; and my soul, which thou hast redeemed.

\p O God, give thy judgment to the king, and thy righteousness to the king's son;

\p
\v 3 Let the mountains and the hills raise peace to thy people: 
\v 4 he shall judge the poor of the people in righteousness, and save the children of the needy; and shall bring low the false accuser. 
\v 5 And he shall continue as long as the sun, and before the moon for ever. 
\v 6 He shall come down as rain upon a fleece; and as drops falling upon the earth. 
\v 7 In his days shall righteousness spring up; and abundance of peace till the moon be removed.

\v 10 The kings of Tharsis, and the isles, shall bring presents: the kings of the Arabians and Saba shall offer gifts. 
\v 11 And all kings shall worship him; all the Gentiles shall serve him. 
\v 12 For he has delivered the poor from the oppressor; and the needy who had no helper. 
\v 13 He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall deliver the souls of the needy. 
\v 14 He shall redeem their souls from usury and injustice: and their name \add shall be\add* precious before him. 
\v 15 And he shall live, and there shall be given him of the gold of Arabia: and \add men\add* shall pray for him continually; \add and\add* all the day shall they praise him. 
\v 16 There shall be an establishment on the earth on the tops of the mountains: the fruit thereof shall be exalted above Libanus, and they of the city shall flourish as grass of the earth.

\v 1 A Psalm for Asaph. 
\p How good is God to Israel, to the upright in heart! 
\v 2 But my feet were almost overthrown; my goings very nearly slipped. 
\v 3 For I was jealous of the transgressors, beholding the tranquillity of sinners. 
\p
\v 4 For there is no sign of reluctance in their death: and \add they have\add* firmness under their affliction. 
\v 5 They are not in the troubles of \add other\add* men; and they shall not be scourged with \add other\add* men. 
\v 6 Therefore pride has possessed them; they have clothed themselves with their injustice and ungodliness. 
\v 7 Their injustice shall go forth as out of fatness: they have fulfilled their intention. 
\v 8 They have taken counsel and spoken in wickedness: they have uttered unrighteousness loftily. 
\v 9 They have set their mouth against heaven, and their tongue has gone through upon the earth. 
\v 10 Therefore shall my people return hither: and full days shall be found \f + \fr 72:10  \fqa Gr. \ft in.\f*with them. 
\v 11 And they said, How does God know? and \f + \fr 72:11  \fqa Gr. \ft if there is.\f*is there knowledge in the Most High? 
\v 12 Behold, these \add are\add* the sinners, and they that prosper always: they have possessed wealth. 
\p
\v 13 And I said, Verily in vain have I justified my heart, and washed my hands in innocency. 
\v 14 For I was plagued all the day, and my reproof \add was\add* every morning. 
\v 15 If I said, I will speak thus; behold, I \add should\add* have broken covenant with the generation of thy children. 
\v 16 And I undertook to understand this, \add but\add* it is too hard for me, 
\v 17 until I go into the sanctuary of God; \add and so\add* understand the latter end. 
\p
\v 18 Surely thou hast appointed \add judgments\add* to them because of their crafty dealings: thou hast cast them down when they were lifted up. 
\v 19 How have they become desolate! suddenly they have failed: they have perished because of their iniquity. 
\v 20 As the dream of one awakening, O Lord, in thy city thou wilt despise their image. 
\p
\v 21 For my heart has rejoiced, and my reins have been \f + \fr 72:21  \fqa Gr. \ft changed.\f*gladdened. 
\v 22 But I \add was\add* vile and knew not: I became brutish before thee. 
\v 23 Yet I am continually with thee: thou hast holden my right hand. 
\v 24 Thou hast guided me by thy counsel, and thou hast taken me to thyself with glory. 
\v 25 For what have I in heaven \add but thee\add*? and what have I desired upon the earth beside thee? 
\v 26 My heart and my flesh have failed: \add but\add* God \add is the strength\add* of my heart, and God is my portion for ever. 
\p
\v 27 For, behold, they that remove themselves far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed every one that goes a whoring from thee. 
\v 28 But it is good for me to cleave close to God, to put my trust in the Lord; that I may proclaim all thy praises in the gates of the daughter of Sion.

\p Wherefore hast thou rejected \add us\add*, O God, for ever? \add wherefore\add* is thy wrath kindled against the sheep of thy pasture? 
\v 2 Remember thy congregation which thou hast purchased from the beginning; thou didst ransom the rod of thine inheritance; this mount Sion wherein thou hast dwelt. 
\v 3 Lift up thine hands against their pride continually; \add because of\add* all that the enemy has done wickedly in thy holy places. 
\p
\v 4 And they that hate thee have boasted in the midst of thy feast; they have set up their standards for signs, 
\v 5 ignorantly as it were in the entrance above; 
\v 6 they cut down its doors at once with axes as in a wood of trees; they have broken it down with hatchet and stone cutter. 
\v 7 They have burnt thy sanctuary with fire to the ground; they have profaned the \f + \fr 73:7  \fqa Gr. \ft tabernacle.\f*habitation of thy name. 
\v 8 They have said in their heart, \add even\add* all their kindred together, Come, let us abolish the feasts of the Lord from the earth. 
\v 9 We have not seen our signs; there is no longer a prophet; and \add God\add* will not know us any more. 
\p
\v 10 How long, O God, shall the enemy reproach? shall the enemy provoke thy name for ever? 
\v 11 Wherefore turnest thou away thine hand, and thy right hand from the midst of thy bosom for ever? 
\v 12 But God is our King \f + \fr 73:12  \fqa Gr. \ft before the age.\f*of old; he has wrought salvation in the midst of the earth. 
\v 13 Thou didst establish the sea, in thy might, thou didst break to pieces the heads of the \f + \fr 73:13  \fqa Or, \ft serpents.\f*dragons in the water. 
\v 14 Thou didst break to pieces the heads of the dragon; thou didst give him \add for\add* meat to the Ethiopian nations. 
\v 15 Thou didst cleave fountains and torrents; thou driedst up \f + \fr 73:15  \fqa Heb. \ft rivers of Etham.\f*mighty rivers. 
\v 16 The day is thine, and the night is thine; thou hast prepared the sun and the moon. 
\v 17 Thou hast made all the borders of the earth; thou hast made summer and spring. 
\p
\v 18 Remember this thy creation: an enemy has reproached the Lord, and a foolish people has provoked thy name. 
\v 19 Deliver not to the wild beasts a soul that gives praise to thee: forget not for ever the souls of thy poor. 
\v 20 Look upon thy covenant: for the dark \add places\add* of the earth are filled with the habitations of iniquity. 
\v 21 Let not the afflicted and shamed one be rejected: the poor and needy shall praise thy name. 
\v 22 Arise, O God, plead thy cause: remember thy reproaches that come from the foolish one all the day. 
\v 23 Forget not the voice of thy suppliants: let the pride of them that hate thee continually ascend before thee.

\v 8 Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be well pleased no more? 
\v 9 Will he cut off his mercy for ever, even for ever and ever? 
\v 10 Will God forget to pity? or will he shut up his compassions in his wrath? Pause. 
\p
\v 11 And I said, Now I have begun; this is the change of the right hand of the Most High. 
\v 12 I remembered the works of the Lord; for I will remember thy wonders from the beginning.

\p Give heed, O my people, to my law: incline your ear to the words of my mouth. 
\v 2  \x + \xo 77:2  \xt Mat. 13. 35.\x* I will open my mouth in parables: I will utter dark sayings \add which have been\add* from the beginning. 
\v 3 All which we have heard and known, and our fathers have declared to us. 
\v 4 They were not hid from their children to a second generation; \add the fathers\add* declaring the praises of the Lord, and his mighty acts, and his wonders which he wrought. 
\p
\v 5 And he raised up a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, to make it known to their children: 
\v 6 that another generation might know, even the sons which should be born; and they should arise and declare them to their children. 
\v 7 That they might set their hope on God, and not forget the works of God, but diligently seek his commandments. 
\v 8 That they should not be as their fathers, a perverse and provoking generation; a generation which set not its heart aright, and its spirit was not \f + \fr 77:8  \fqa Or, \ft faithfully secured.\f*steadfast with God. 
\p
\v 9 The children of Ephraim, bending and shooting \add with\add* the bow, turned \add back\add* in the day of battle. 
\v 10 They kept not the covenant of God, and would not walk in his law. 
\v 11 And they forgot his benefits, and his miracles which he \add had\add* shewed them; 
\v 12 the miracles which he wrought before their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the plain of Tanes. 
\v 13 He clave the sea, and led them through: he made the waters to stand as \add in\add* a bottle. 
\v 14 And he guided them with a cloud by day, and all the night with a light of fire. 
\v 15 He clave a rock in the wilderness, and made them drink as in a great deep. 
\v 16 And he brought water out of the rock, and caused waters to flow down as rivers. 
\p
\v 17 And they sinned yet more against him; they provoked the Most High in the wilderness. 
\v 18 And they tempted God in their hearts, in asking meat for \add the desire of\add* their souls. 
\v 19 They spoke also against God, and said, Will God be able to prepare a table in the wilderness? 
\v 20 Forasmuch as he smote the rock, and the waters flowed, and the torrents ran abundantly; will he be able also to give bread, or prepare a table for his people? 
\p
\v 21 Therefore the Lord heard, and was provoked: and fire was kindled in Jacob, and wrath went up against Israel. 
\v 22 Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation. 
\v 23 Yet he commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven, 
\v 24 and rained upon them manna to eat, and gave them the bread of heaven. 
\v 25 Man ate angels' bread; \x + \xo 77:25  \xt Mat. 6. 31.\x* he sent them provision to the full. 
\p
\v 26 He removed the south wind from heaven; and by his might he brought in the south-west wind. 
\v 27 And he rained upon them flesh like dust, and feathered birds like the sand of the seas. 
\v 28 And they fell into the midst of their camp, round about their tents. 
\v 29 So they ate, and were completely filled; and he gave them their desire. 
\p
\v 30 They were not disappointed of their desire: \add but\add* when their food was yet in their mouth, 
\v 31 then the indignation of God rose up against them, and slew the fattest of them, and overthrew the choice men of Israel. 
\p
\v 32 In the midst of all this they sinned yet more, and believed not his miracles. 
\v 33 And their days were consumed in vanity, and their years with anxiety. 
\p
\v 34 When he slew them, they sought him: and they returned and called betimes upon God. 
\v 35 And they remembered that God was their helper, and the most high God was their redeemer. 
\v 36 Yet they loved him \add only\add* with their mouth, and lied to him with their tongue. 
\v 37 For their heart \add was\add* not right with him, neither were they steadfast in his covenant. 
\p
\v 38 But he is compassionate, and will \f + \fr 77:38  \fqa Gr. \ft be propitious, \fqa or, \ft merciful to.\f*forgive their sins, and will not destroy \add them\add*: yea, he will frequently turn away his wrath, and will not kindle all his anger. 
\v 39 And he remembered that they are flesh; a wind that passes away, and returns not. 
\p
\v 40 How often did they provoke him in the wilderness, \add and\add* anger him in a dry land! 
\v 41 Yea, they turned back, and tempted God, and provoked the Holy One of Israel. 
\v 42 They remembered not his hand, the day in which he delivered them from the hand of the oppressor. 
\v 43 How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Tanes: 
\v 44 and had changed their rivers into blood; and their \f + \fr 77:44  \fqa Gr. \ft rains, \fqa or, \ft showers.\f*streams, that they should not drink. 
\v 45 He sent against them the dog-fly, and it devoured them; and the frog, and it spoiled them. 
\v 46 And he gave their fruit to the canker worm, and their labours to the locust. 
\v 47 He killed their vines with hail, and their sycamores with frost. 
\v 48 And he gave up their cattle to hail, and their substance to the fire. 
\v 49 He sent out against them the fury of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and affliction, a message by evil angels. 
\v 50 He made a way for his wrath; he spared not their souls from death, but consigned their cattle to death; 
\v 51 and smote every first-born in the land of Egypt; the first-fruits of their labours in the tents of Cham. 
\v 52 And he removed his people like sheep; he led them as a flock in the wilderness. 
\v 53 And he guided them with hope, and they feared not: but the sea covered their enemies. 
\v 54 And he brought them in to the mountain of his sanctuary, this mountain which his right hand had purchased. 
\v 55 And he cast out the nations from before them, and made them to inherit by a line of inheritance, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. 
\p
\v 56 Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies. 
\v 57 And they turned back, and broke covenant, even as also their fathers: they became like a crooked bow. 
\v 58 And they provoked him with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images. 
\p
\v 59 God heard and \f + \fr 77:59  \fqa Lit. \ft overlooked them. See \xt Acts 17. 30.\f*lightly regarded \add them\add*, and greatly despised Israel. 
\v 60 And he rejected the tabernacle of Selom, his tent where he dwelt among men. 
\v 61 And he gave their strength into captivity, and their beauty into the enemy's hand. 
\v 62 And he \f + \fr 77:62  \fqa Gr. \ft shut up.\f*gave his people to the sword; and disdained his inheritance. 
\v 63 Fire devoured their young men; and their virgins mourned not. 
\v 64 Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows shall not be wept for. 
\p
\v 65 So the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, \add and\add* as a mighty man who has been heated with wine. 
\v 66 And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he brought on them a perpetual reproach. 
\p
\v 67 And he rejected the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim; 
\v 68 but chose the tribe of Juda, the mount Sion which he loved. 
\v 69 And he built his sanctuary as \add the place\add* of unicorns; he founded it for ever on the earth. 
\v 70 He chose David also his servant, and took him up from the flocks of sheep. 
\v 71 He took him from following the ewes great with young, to be the shepherd of Jacob his servant, and Israel his inheritance. 
\v 72 So he tended them in the innocency of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.

\v 4 A perverse heart has not cleaved to me; I have not known an evil man, forasmuch as he turns away from me.

\v 6 Mine eyes \add shall be\add* upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walked in a perfect way, the same ministered to me. 
\v 7 The proud doer dwelt not in the midst of my house; the unjust speaker prospered not in my sight.

\v 4 For my days have vanished like smoke, and my bones have been parched like a stick. 
\v 5 I am blighted like grass, and my heart is dried up; for I have forgotten to eat my bread. 
\v 6 By reason of the voice of my groaning, my bone has cleaved to my flesh. 
\v 7 I have become like a pelican of the wilderness; 
\v 8 I have become like an owl in a ruined house. I have watched, and am become as a sparrow dwelling alone on a roof. 
\v 9 All the day long mine enemies have reproached me; and they that praised me have sworn against me. 
\v 10 For I have eaten ashes as it were bread, and mingled my drink with weeping; 
\v 11 because of thine anger and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and dashed me down. 
\p
\v 12 My days have declined like a shadow; and I am withered like grass.

\v 6 The Lord executes mercy and judgment for all that are injured. 
\v 7 He made known his ways to Moses, his will to the children of Israel. 
\v 8 The Lord is compassionate and pitiful, long-suffering, and full of mercy. 
\v 9 He will not be always angry; neither will he be wrathful for ever. 
\v 10 He has not dealt with us according to our sins, nor recompensed us according to our iniquities. 
\v 11 For as the heaven is high above the earth, the Lord has \add so\add* increased his mercy toward them that fear him. 
\v 12 As far as the east is from the west, \add so far\add* has he removed our transgressions from us. 
\v 13 As a father pities \add his\add* children, the Lord pities them that fear him.

\v 7 At thy rebuke they shall flee; at the voice of thy thunder they shall be alarmed. 
\v 8 They go up to the mountains, and down to the plains, to the place which thou hast founded for them. 
\v 9 Thou hast set a bound which they shall not pass, neither shall they turn again to cover the earth. 
\p
\v 10 He sends forth his fountains among the valleys: the waters shall run between the mountains. 
\v 11 They shall give drink to all the wild beasts of the field: the wild asses shall take \add of them\add* to \add quench\add* their thirst. 
\v 12 By them shall the birds of the sky lodge: they shall utter a voice out of the midst of the rocks. 
\v 13 He waters the mountains from his chambers: the earth shall be satisfied with the fruit of thy works. 
\p
\v 14 He makes grass to grow for the cattle, and green herb for the service of men, to bring bread out of the earth; 
\v 15 and wine makes glad the heart of man, to make his face cheerful with oil: and bread strengthens man's heart. 
\v 16 The trees of the plain shall be full \add of sap; even\add* the cedars of Libanus which he has planted. 
\v 17 There the sparrows will build their nests; and the house of the heron takes the lead among them. 
\v 18 The high mountains are a refuge for the stags, \add and\add* the rock for the rabbits. 
\p
\v 19 He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knows his going down. 
\v 20 Thou didst make darkness, and it was night; in it all the wild beasts of the forest will be abroad: 
\v 21  \add even\add* young lions roaring for prey, and to seek meat for themselves from God. 
\v 22 The sun arises, and they shall be gathered together, and shall lie down in their dens. 
\v 23 Man shall go forth to his work, and to his labour till evening. 
\p
\v 24 How great are thy works, O Lord! in wisdom hast thou wrought them all: the earth is filled with thy creation. 
\v 25  \add So is\add* this great and wide sea: there are things creeping innumerable, small animals and great. 
\v 26 There go the ships; \add and\add* this dragon whom thou hast made to play in it. 
\v 27 All wait upon thee, to give them \add their\add* food in due season. 
\v 28 When thou hast given \add it\add* them, they will gather \add it\add*; and when thou hast opened thine hand, they shall all be filled with good. 
\v 29 But when thou hast turned away thy face, they shall be troubled: thou wilt take away their breath, and they shall fail, and return to their dust. 
\v 30 Thou shalt send forth thy Spirit, and they shall be created; and thou shalt renew the face of the earth. 
\p
\v 31 Let the glory of the Lord be for ever: the Lord shall rejoice in his works; 
\v 32 who looks upon the earth, and makes it tremble; who touches the mountains, and they smoke. 
\v 33 I will sing to the Lord while I live; I will sing praise to my God while I exist. 
\v 34 Let my meditation be sweet to him: and I will rejoice in the Lord.

\v 10 And he established it to Jacob for an ordinance, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant; 
\v 11 saying, To thee will I give the land of Chanaan, the line of your inheritance: 
\v 12 when they were few in number, very few, and sojourners in it. 
\v 13 And they went from nation to nation, and from \add one\add* kingdom to another people. 
\v 14 He suffered no man to wrong them; and he rebuked kings for their sakes: 
\v 15  \add saying\add*, Touch not my anointed ones; and do my prophets no harm. 
\v 16 Moreover he called for a famine upon the land; he broke the whole support of bread.

\v 23 Israel also came into Egypt, and Jacob sojourned in the land of Cham. 
\v 24 And he increased his people greatly, and made them stronger than their enemies.

\v 26 He sent forth Moses his servant, \add and\add* Aaron whom he had chosen. 
\p
\v 27 He established among them his signs, and \add his\add* wonders in the land of Cham. 
\v 28 He sent forth darkness, and made it dark; yet they \f + \fr 104:28  \fqa Gr. \ft embittered.\f*rebelled against his words. 
\v 29 He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish. 
\v 30 Their land produced frogs abundantly, in the chambers of their kings. 
\v 31 He spoke, and the dog-fly came, and lice in all their coasts. 
\v 32 He turned their rain into hail, \add and sent\add* flaming fire in their land.

\v 36 He smote also every first-born of their land, the first-fruits of all their labour. 
\v 37 And he brought them out with silver and gold; and there was not a feeble one among their tribes. 
\v 38 Egypt rejoiced at their departing; for the fear of them fell upon them. 
\v 39 He spread out a cloud for a covering to them, and fire to give them light by night. 
\v 40 They asked, and the quail came, and he satisfied them with the bread of heaven. 
\v 41 He clave the rock, and the waters flowed; rivers ran in dry places.

\v 6 We have sinned with our fathers, we have transgressed, we have done unrighteously. 
\v 7 Our fathers in Egypt understood not thy wonders, and remembered not the multitude of thy mercy; but provoked \add him\add* as they went up by the Red Sea. 
\v 8 Yet he saved them for his name's sake, that he might cause his mighty power to be known. 
\v 9 And he rebuked the Red Sea, and it was dried up: so he led them through the deep as through the wilderness. 
\v 10 And he saved them out of the hand of them that hated \add them\add*, and redeemed them out of the hand of the enemy. 
\v 11 The water covered those that oppressed them: there was not one of them left. 
\v 12 Then they believed his words, and celebrated his praise. 
\v 13 They made haste, they forgot his works; they waited not for his counsel. 
\v 14 And they lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the dry \add land\add*. 
\v 15 And he gave them their request, and sent fulness into their souls. 
\p
\v 16 They provoked Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the holy one of the Lord. 
\v 17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and closed upon the congregation of Abiron. 
\v 18 And a fire was kindled in their congregation, and a flame burnt up the sinners. 
\p
\v 19 And they made a calf in Choreb, and worshipped the graven image, 
\v 20 and they changed their glory into the similitude of a calf that feeds on grass. 
\v 21 They forgot God that saved them, who had wrought great deeds in Egypt; 
\v 22 wondrous \add works\add* in the land of Cham, and terrible things at the Red Sea. 
\v 23 So he said that he would have destroyed them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn \add him\add* away from the fierceness of his anger, so that he should not destroy them. 
\p
\v 24 Moreover they set at nought the desirable land, and believed not his word. 
\v 25 And they murmured in their tents: they hearkened not to the voice of the Lord. 
\v 26 So he lifted up his hand against them, to cast them down in the wilderness; 
\v 27 and to cast down their seed among the nations, and to scatter them in the countries. 
\p
\v 28 They were joined also to Beelphegor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead. And they provoked him with their devices; 
\v 29 and destruction was multiplied among them. 
\v 30 Then Phinees stood up, and made atonement: and the plague ceased. 
\v 31 And it was counted to him for righteousness, to all generations for ever. 
\p
\v 32 They provoked him also at the water of Strife, and Moses was hurt for their sakes; 
\v 33 for they provoked his spirit, and he \f + \fr 105:33  \fqa Or, \ft gave commandment.\f*spoke \add unadvisedly\add* with his lips. 
\p
\v 34 They destroyed not the nations which the Lord told them \add to destroy\add*; 
\v 35 but were mingled with the heathen, and learned their works. 
\v 36 And they served their graven images; and it became an offence to them. 
\v 37 And they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to devils, 
\v 38 and shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Chanaan; and the land was \f + \fr 105:38  \fqa Or, \ft murderously defiled.\f*defiled with blood, 
\v 39 and was polluted with their works; and they went a whoring with their own devices. 
\p
\v 40 So the Lord was very angry with his people, and he abhorred his inheritance. 
\v 41 And he delivered them into the hands of \add their\add* enemies; and they that hated them ruled over them. 
\v 42 And their enemies oppressed them, and they were brought down under their hands. 
\v 43 Many a time he delivered them; but they provoked him by their counsel, and they were brought low by their iniquities. 
\v 44 Yet the Lord looked upon their affliction, when he heard their petition. 
\v 45 And he remembered his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercy. 
\v 46 And he caused them to be pitied in the sight of all who carried them captive. 
\p
\v 47 Save us, O Lord our God, and gather us from among the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, that we may glory in thy praise.

\v 7 And he guided them into a straight path, that they might go to a city of habitation.

\v 37 And they sow fields, and plant vineyards, and they yield fruit of increase. 
\v 38 And he blesses them, and they multiply exceedingly, and he diminishes not the number of their cattle. 
\v 39 Again they become few, and are brought low, by the pressure of evils and pain. 
\v 40 Contempt is poured upon their princes, and he causes them to wander in a desert and trackless land. 
\v 41 But he helps the poor out of poverty, and makes \add him\add* families as a flock.

\v 2 O God, my heart is ready, my heart is ready; I will sing and sing psalms with my glory. 
\v 3 Awake, psaltery and harp; I will awake early. 
\v 4 I will give thanks to thee, O Lord, among the people; I will sing praise to thee among the Gentiles. 
\v 5 For thy mercy is great above the heavens, and thy truth \add reaches\add* to the clouds. 
\v 6 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; and thy glory above all the earth. 
\v 7 That thy beloved \add ones\add* may be delivered, save with thy right hand, and hear me. God has spoken in his sanctuary; 
\v 8 I will be exalted, and will divide Sicima, and will measure out the valley of tents. 
\v 9 Galaad is mine; and Manasses is mine; and Ephraim is the help of mine head; Judas is my king; 
\v 10 Moab is the caldron of my hope; over Idumea will I cast my sandal; the Philistines are made subject to me. 
\p
\v 11 Who will bring me into the fortified city? or who will guide me to Idumea? 
\v 12 Wilt not thou, O God, who hast rejected us? and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts?

\v 1 For the end, a Psalm of David. 
\p O God, pass not over my praise in silence; 
\v 2 for the mouth of the sinner and the mouth of the crafty \add man\add* have been opened against me: they have spoken against me with a crafty tongue. 
\v 3 And they have compassed me with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause. 
\v 4  \f + \fr 108:4  \fqa Or, \ft in return for my love.\f*Instead of loving me, they falsely accused me: but I continued to pray. 
\v 5 And they rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love. 
\p
\v 6 Set thou a sinner against him; and let \f + \fr 108:6  \fqa Or, \ft the accuser.\f*the devil stand at his right hand. 
\v 7 When he is judged, let him go forth condemned: and let his prayer become sin. 
\v 8 Let his days be few: and \x + \xo 108:8  \xt Acts 1. 20.\x* let another take his office of overseer. 
\v 9 Let his children be orphans, and his wife a widow. 
\v 10 Let his children wander without a dwelling-place, and beg: let them be cast out of their habitations. 
\v 11 Let \add his\add* creditor exact all that belongs to him: and let strangers spoil his labours. 
\v 12 Let him have no helper; neither let there be any one to have compassion on his fatherless children. 
\v 13 Let his children be \add given up\add* to utter destruction: in one generation let his name be blotted out. 
\v 14 Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the Lord; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out. 
\v 15 Let them be before the Lord continually; and let their memorial be blotted out from the earth. 
\p
\v 16 Because he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the needy and poor man, and \add that\add* to slay him that was pricked in the heart. 
\v 17 He loved cursing also, and it shall come upon him; and he took not pleasure in blessing, so it shall be removed far from him. 
\v 18 Yea, he put on cursing as a garment, and it is come as water into his bowels, and as oil into his bones. 
\v 19 Let it be to him as a garment which he puts on, and as a girdle with which he girds himself continually. 
\v 20 This is the dealing of the Lord with those who falsely accuse me, and of them that speak evil against my soul. 
\p
\v 21 But thou, O Lord, Lord, deal \add mercifully\add* with me, for thy name's sake: for thy mercy is good. 
\v 22 Deliver me, for I am poor and needy; and my heart is troubled within me. 
\v 23 I am removed as a shadow in its going down: I am tossed up and down like locusts. 
\v 24 My knees are weakened through fasting, and my flesh is changed by reason of \add the want of\add* oil. 
\v 25 I became also a reproach to them: \add when\add* they saw me they shook their heads. 
\p
\v 26 Help me, O Lord my God; and save me according to thy mercy. 
\v 27 And let them know that this is thy hand; and \add that\add* thou, Lord, hast wrought it. 
\v 28 Let them curse, but thou shalt bless: let them that rise up against me be ashamed, but let thy servant rejoice. 
\v 29 Let those that falsely accuse me be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their shame as with a mantle. 
\v 30 I will give thanks to the Lord abundantly with my mouth; and in the midst of many I will praise him. 
\v 31 For he stood on the right hand of the poor, to save \add me\add* from them that persecute my soul.

\v 117 Help me, and I shall be saved; and I will meditate in thine ordinances continually. 
\v 118 Thou hast brought to nought all that depart from thine ordinances; for their inward thought is unrighteous. 
\v 119 I have reckoned all the sinners of the earth as transgressors; therefore have I loved thy testimonies. 
\v 120 Penetrate my flesh with thy fear; for I am afraid of thy judgments.
