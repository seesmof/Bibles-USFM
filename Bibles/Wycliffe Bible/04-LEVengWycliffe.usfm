\v 1 FORSOTHE the Lord clepide Moyses, and spak to him fro the tabernacle of witnessyng, `and seide, 
\v 2 Speke thou to the sones of Israel, and thou schalt seie to hem, A man of you, that offrith to the Lord a sacrifice of beestis, that is, of oxun and of scheep, and offrith slayn sacrifices, if his offryng is brent sacrifice, 
\v 3 and of the droue of oxun, he schal offre a male beeste without wem at the dore of the tabernacle of witnessyng, to make the Lord plesid to hym. 
\v 4 And he schal sette hondis on the heed of the sacrifice, and it schal be acceptable, and profityng in to clensyng of hym. 
\v 5 And he schal offre a calf bifor the Lord, and the sones of Aaron, preestis, schulen offre the blood ther of, and thei schulen schede bi the cumpas of the auter, which is bifor the dore of the tabernacle. 
\v 6 And whanne the skyn of the sacrifice is drawun awei, thei schulen kitte the membris in to gobetis; 
\v 7 and thei schulen put vndur in the auter fier,\f + \fr 1:7  \ft  fier, that is, trees to the nurschyng and continuaunce of fier youun fro heuene. \f* and thei schulen make an heep of wode bifore; and thei schulen ordeyne aboue 
\v 8 `the trees tho thingis that ben kit, that is, the heed, and alle thingis that cleuen to the mawe, 
\v 9 whanne the entrailis and feet ben waischid with watir; and the preest schal brenne tho on the auter, in to brent sacrifice, and swete odour to the Lord. 
\v 10 That if the offryng is of litle beestis, a brent sacrifice of scheep, ethir of geet, he schal offre a male beeste with out wem, 
\v 11 and he schal offre at the side of the auter that biholdith to the north, bifore the Lord. Sotheli the sones of Aaron schulen schede the blood therof on the auter `bi cumpas, 
\v 12 and thei schulen departe the membris, the heed, and alle thingis that cleuen to the mawe, and thei schulen putte on the trees, vndur whiche the fier schal be set; 
\v 13 sotheli thei schulen waische in watir the entrailis and feet; and the preest schal brenne alle thingis offrid on the auter, in to brent sacrifice, and swettest odour to the Lord. 
\v 14 Forsothe if the offryng of brent sacrifice to the Lord is of briddis, of turtlis, and of culuer briddis, 
\v 15 the preest schal offre it at the auter; and whanne the heed is writhun to the necke, and the place of the wounde is brokun, he schal make the blood renne doun on the brenke of the auter. 
\v 16 Sotheli he schal caste forth the litil bladdir of the throte, and fetheris bisidis the auter, at the eest coost, in the place in which the aischis ben wont to be sched out; 
\v 17 and he schal breke the wyngis therof, and he schal not kerue, nether he schal departe it with yrun; and he schal brenne it on the auter, whanne fier is set vndur the trees; it is a brent sacrifice, and an offryng of swete odour to the Lord. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 Whanne a soule offrith an offryng of sacrifice to the Lord, flour of wheete schal be his offring. And he schal schede oile ther onne, 
\v 2 and he schal putte encense, and he schal bere to the sones of Aaron, preest, of whiche sones oon schal take an handful of `flour of whete, and of oile, and alle the encense; and he schal putte a memorial on the auter, in to swettest odour to the Lord. 
\v 3 Forsothe that that `is residue of the sacrifice schal be Aarons and hise sones, the hooli of hooli thingis of offryngis to the Lord. 
\v 4 Forsothe whanne thou offrist a sacrifice bakun in an ouene of whete flour, that is, loouys without sour dow, spreynd with oile, and therf breed sodun in watir, bawmed with oile; 
\v 5 if thin offryng is `of a friyng panne, of wheete flour spreynd with oile and without sour dow, 
\v 6 thou schalt departe it in smale partis, and thou schalt schede oile ther onne. 
\v 7 Ellis if the sacrifice is of a gridele, euenli the whete flour schal be spreynd with oile; 
\v 8 which whete flour thou schalt offre to the Lord, and schalt bitake in the hondis of the preest. 
\v 9 And whanne he hath offrid it, he schal take a memorial of the sacrifice, and he schal brenne it on the auter, in to `odour of swetnesse to the Lord. 
\v 10 Sotheli what euer thing `is residue, it schal be Aarons and hise sones, the hooly of hooli thingis of the offryngis to the Lord. 
\v 11 Ech offryng which is offrid to the Lord, schal be without sour dow, nether ony thing of sour dow, and of hony, schal be brent in the sacrifice of the Lord. 
\v 12 Ye schulen offre oneli the firste fruytis of tho, and yiftis; sotheli tho schulen not be put on the auter, in to odour of swetnesse. 
\v 13 Whateuer thing of sacrifice thou schalt offre, thou schalt make it sauery with salt, nether thou schalt take awey the salt of the boond of pees of thi God fro thi sacrifice; in ech offryng thou schalt offre salt. 
\v 14 Forsothe if thou offrist a yifte of the firste thingis of thi fruytis to the Lord, of `eeris of corn yit grene, thou schalt seenge tho in fier, and thou schalt breke in the maner of seedis; and so thou schalt offre thi firste fruytis to the Lord, 
\v 15 and thou schalt schede oyle theronne, and schalt putte encense, for it is the offryng of the Lord. 
\v 16 Of which the preest schal brenne, in to mynde of the yifte, a part of the `seedis brokun, and of oyle, and al the encense. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 That if his offryng is a sacrifice of pesible thingis, and he wole offre of oxun, he schal offre bifore the Lord a male, ether a female, without wem. 
\v 2 And he schal sette hond on the heed of his sacrifice, that schal be offrid in the entryng of the tabernacle; and the sones of Aaron preest schulen schede the blood bi the cumpas of the auter. 
\v 3 And thei schulen offre of the sacrifice of pesible thingis in to offryng to the Lord, the fatnesse that hilith the entrailis, and what euer thing of fatnesse is with ynne; 
\v 4 thei schulen offre twey kydeneris, with the fatnesse bi which the guttis clepid ylyon ben hilid, and the calle of the lyuer with the litle reynes. 
\v 5 And thei schulen brenne tho on the auter, in to brent sacrifice, whanne fier is put vndur the trees, in to offryng of swettest odour to the Lord. 
\v 6 Sotheli if his offryng is of scheep, and a sacrifice of pesible thingis, whether he offrith a male ether a female, tho schulen be without wem. 
\v 7 If he offrith a lombe bifor the Lord, 
\v 8 he schal sette his hond on the heed of his sacrifice, that schal be offrid in the porche of the tabernacle of witnessyng; and the sones of Aaron schulen schede the blood therof bi `the cumpas of the auter. 
\v 9 And thei schulen offre of the sacrifice of pesible thingis a sacrifice to the Lord, the innere fatnesse, 
\v 10 and al the tail with the reynes, and the fatnesse that hilith the wombe, and alle the entrailis, and euer eithir litil reyne, with the fatnesse which is bisidis the `guttis clepid ylion, and the calle of the mawe, with the litle reynes. 
\v 11 And the preest schal brenne tho on the auter, in to the fedyng of fier, and of the offryng to the Lord. 
\v 12 If his offryng is a geet, and he offrith it to the Lord, 
\v 13 he schal sette his hond on the heed therof, and he schal offre it in to the entryng of the tabernacle of witnessyng; and the sones of Aaron schulen schede the blood therof bi the cumpas of the auter. 
\v 14 And thei schulen take therof, in to `the fedyng of the Lordis fier, the fatnesse that hilith the wombe, and that hilith alle the entrailis, 
\v 15 and twei litle reynes with the calle which is on tho bisidis ilion, and the fatnesse of the mawe, with the entrails that cleuen to the litle reynes. 
\v 16 And the preest schal brenne tho on the auter, in to the fedyng of fier, and of swettest odour; al the fatnesse schal be the Lordis, 
\v 17 by euerlastynge riyt in generaciouns, and in alle youre dwellyng placis, nether in ony maner ye schulen ete blood, nethir fatnesse. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spak to Moises, and seide, Speke thou to the sones of Israel, 
\v 2 Whanne a soule hath do synne bi ignoraunce, and hath do ony thing of alle comaundementis `of the Lord, whiche he comaundide that tho schulen not be don; if a preest which is anoyntid, 
\v 3 hath do synne, makynge the puple to trespasse, he schal offre for his synne a calf without wem to the Lord. 
\v 4 And he schal brynge it to the dore of the tabernacle of witnessyng, bifor the Lord, and he schal sette hond on the heed therof, and he schal offre it to the Lord. 
\v 5 And he schal take vp of the blood `of the calf, and schal brynge it in to the tabernacle of witnessyng. 
\v 6 And whanne he hath dippid the fyngir in to the blood, he schal sprenge it seuen sithis bifor the Lord, ayens the veil of the seyntuarie. 
\v 7 And he schal putte of the same blood on the corners of the auter of encense moost acceptable to the Lord, which auter is in the tabernacle of witnessyng; sotheli he schal schede al the `tother blood in to the foundement of the auter of brent sacrifice in the entryng of the tabernacle. 
\v 8 And he schal offre for synne the ynnere fatnesse of the calf, as well it that hilith the entrails, as alle thingis that ben with ynne, 
\v 9 twei litle reynes, and the calle, which is on tho bisidis ilion, and the fatnesse of the mawe, 
\v 10 with the litle reines, as it is offrid of the calf of the sacrifice of pesible thingis; and he schal brenne tho on the auter of brent sacrifice. 
\v 11 Sotheli he schal bere out of the castels the skyn, and alle the fleischis, with the heed, and feet, and entrails, 
\v 12 and dung, and the `residue bodi in to a clene place, where aischis ben wont to be sched out; and he schal brenne tho on the heep of trees, whiche schulen be brent in the place of aischis sched out. 
\v 13 That if al the cumpeny of the sones of Israel knowith not, and doith by vnkunnyng that that is ayens the comaundement of the Lord, 
\v 14 and aftirward vndirstondith his synne, it schal offre a calf for synne, and it schal brynge the calf to the dore of the tabernacle. 
\v 15 And the eldere men of the puple schulen sette hondis on the heed therof bifor the Lord; and whanne the calf is offrid in the siyt of the Lord, 
\v 16 the preest which is anoyntid schal bere ynne of his blood in to the tabernacle of witnessyng; 
\v 17 and whanne the fyngur `is dippid, he schal sprenge seuen sithis ayens the veil. 
\v 18 And he schal putte of the same blood in the hornes of the auter, which is bifor the Lord in the tabernacle of witnessyng; sotheli he schal schede the `residue blood bisidis the foundement of the auter of brent sacrifice, which is in the dore of tabernacle of witnessyng. 
\v 19 And he schal take al the fatnesse therof, and schal brenne it on the auter; 
\v 20 and so he schal do also of this calf, as he dide also bifor; and whanne the prest schal preye for hem, the Lord schal be merciful. 
\v 21 Forsothe he schal bere out thilke calf, and schal brenne it, as also the formere calf, for it is for the synne of the multitude. 
\v 22 If the prince synneth, and doith bi ignoraunce o thing of many, which is forbodun in the lawe of the Lord, 
\v 23 and aftirward vndirstondith his synne, he schal offre to the Lord a sacrifice, a `buk of geet, `that hath no wem; 
\v 24 and he schal sette his hond on the heed therof. And whanne he hath offrid it in the place, where brent sacrifice is wont to be slayn, bifor the Lord, for it is for synne; 
\v 25 the preest schal dippe the fyngur in the blood of sacrifice for synne, and he schal touche the corneris of the auter of brent sacrifice, and he schal schede the `residue blood at the foundement therof. 
\v 26 Sotheli the preest schal brenne the innere fatnesse aboue the auter, as it is wont to be doon in the sacrifice of pesible thingis, and the preest schal preye for hym, and for his synne, and it schal be foryouun to hym. 
\v 27 That if a soule of the puple of the lond synneth bi ignoraunce, that he do ony thing of these that ben forbodun in the lawe of the Lord, and trespassith, 
\v 28 and knowith his synne, he schal offre a geet without wem; 
\v 29 and he schal sette hond on the heed of the sacrifice which is for synne, and he schal offre it in the place of brent sacrifice. 
\v 30 And the preest schal take of the blood on his fyngur, and he schal touche the hornes of the auter of brent sacryfice, and he schal schede the residue at the foundement therof. 
\v 31 Sotheli he schal take a wei al the ynnere fatnesse, as it is wont to be don a wei of the sacrifices of pesible thingis, and he schal brenne it on the auter, in to odour of swetnesse to the Lord; and the preest schal preye for hym, and it schal be foryouun to hym. 
\v 32 Sotheli if he offrith of litle beestis a sacrifice for synne, that is, 
\v 33 a scheep without wem, he schal putte the hond on the heed therof, and he schal offre it in the place where the beest of brent sacrifices ben wont to be slayn. 
\v 34 And the preest schal take of the blood therof in his fyngur, and he schal touche the hornes of the autir of brent sacrifice, and he schal schede the residue at the foundement therof. 
\v 35 And he schal do awey al the ynnere fatnesse as the innere fatnesse of the ram which is offrid for pesible thingis, is wont to be don a wei, and he schal brenne it on the auter of encense of the Lord; and the preest schal preye for hym, and for his synne, and it schal be foryouun to hym.

\v 1 If a soule synneth, and \f + \fr 5:1  \ft  This word and is seet for that is. \f* hereth the vois of a swerere,\f + \fr 5:1  \ft  In Ebreu it is of an ooth, and this lettre is vndurstondun of him, that is requirid to bere witnessyng of a thing that he knowith, and wole not, but hidith the truth. \f* and is witnesse, `for ether he siy, ether `is witynge, if he schewith not, he schal bere his synne. 
\v 2 A persone that touchith ony vnclene thing, ether which is slayn of a beeste, ether is deed bi it silf, ether touchith ony other crepynge beeste, and foryetith his vnclennesse, he is gilti, and trespassith. 
\v 3 And if he touchith ony thing of the vnclennesse of man, bi al the vnclennesse bi which he is wont to be defoulid, and he foryetith, and knowith afterward, he schal be suget to trespas. 
\v 4 A soule that swerith, and bryngith forth with hise lippis, that it schulde do ether yuel, ether wel, and doith not, and confermeth the same thing with an ooth, ethir with a word, and foryetith, and aftirward vndirstondith his trespas, do it penaunce for synne, 
\v 5 and offre it of the flockis a femal lomb, ethir a goet; 
\v 6 and the preest schal preie for hym, and for his synne. 
\v 7 But if he may not offre a beeste, offre he twei turtlis, ethir `briddis of culuers to the Lord, oon for synne, and the tother in to brent sacrifice. 
\v 8 And he schal yyue tho to the preest, which schal offre the firste for synne, and schal folde ayen the heed therof to the wengis, so that it cleue to the necke, and be not `brokyn outirli. 
\v 9 And the preest schal sprynge the wal of the auter, of the blood therof; sotheli what euer `is residue, he schal make to droppe doun at the `foundement of the auter, for it is for synne. 
\v 10 Sotheli he schal brenne the tother brid in to brent sacrifice, as it is wont to be doon; and the preest schal preie for hym, and for his synne, and it schal be foryouun to hym. 
\v 11 That if his hond mai not offre twei turtlis, ethir twei `briddis of culueris, he schal offre for his synne the tenthe part of ephi \f + \fr 5:11  \ft  that is, the tenthe part of iij. buschelis. \f* of wheete flour; he schal not putte oile `in to it, nether he schal putte ony thing of encense, for it is for synne. 
\v 12 And he schal yyue it to the preest, which preest schal take vp an handful therof, and schal brenne on the auter, in to mynde of hym that offeride, 
\v 13 and the preest schal preie for hym, and schal clense; forsothe he schal have the tother part in yifte. 
\v 14 And the Lord spak to Moises, 
\v 15 and seide, If a soule brekith cerymonyes bi errour, and synneth in these thingis that ben halewid to the Lord, it schal offre for his trespas a ram without wem of the flockis, that may be bouyt for twey siclis, bi the weiyte of the seyntuarie. 
\v 16 And he schal restore that harm that he dide, and he schal putte the fyuethe part aboue, and schal yyue to the preest, which preest schal preye for hym, and offre the ram, and it schal be foryouun to hym. 
\v 17 A soule that synneth bi ignoraunce, and doith oon of these thingis that ben forbodun in the lawe of the Lord, and is gilti of synne, and vndirstondith his wickidnesse, 
\v 18 it schal offre to the preest a ram without wem of the flockis, bi the mesure of estymacioun of synne; and the preest schal preye for hym, for he dide vnwytynge, and it schal be foryouun to him, 
\v 19 for by errour he trespasside ayens the Lord. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spak to Moises, 
\v 2 and seide, A soule that synneth, and dispisith the Lord, and denyeth to his neiybore a thing bitakun to kepyng, that was bitakun to his feith, ethir takith maisterfuli a thing bi violence, ether makith fals chaleng, 
\v 3 ether fyndith a thing lost, and denyeth ferthermore and forswerith, and doth ony other thing of manye in whiche thingis men ben wont to do synne, 
\v 4 `if it is conuict of the gilt, 
\v 5 it schal yelde hool alle thingis whiche it wolde gete bi fraude, and ferthermore the fyuethe part to the lord, to whom it dide harm. 
\v 6 Sotheli for his synne it schal offre a ram vnwemmed of the floc, and it schal yyue that ram to the preest, bi the valu and mesure of the trespas; 
\v 7 and the preest schal preie for hym bifor the Lord, and it schal be foryouun to hym, for alle thingis whiche he synnede in doyng. 
\v 8 And the Lord spak to Moises, and seide, 
\v 9 Comaunde thou to Aaron, and to hise sones, This is the lawe of brent sacrifice; it schal be brent in the auter al nyyt til the morewe; fier that is youun fro heuene schal be of the same auter. 
\v 10 The preest schal be clothid with a coote, and `pryuy lynnun clothis; and he schal take awei the aischis, which the fier deuourynge brente, and he schal putte bisidis the auter; 
\v 11 and he schal be spuylid of the formere clothis, and he schal be clothid with other, and schal bere aischis out of the castels, and in a moost clene place he schal make tho to be wastid til to a deed sparcle. 
\v 12 Forsothe fier schal brenne euere in the auter, which fier the preest schal nurische, puttynge trees vndur, in the morewtid bi ech dai; and whanne brent sacrifice is put aboue, the preest schal brenne the ynnere fatnessis of pesible thingis. 
\v 13 This is euerlastynge fier, that schal neuer faile in the auter. 
\v 14 This is the lawe of sacrifice, and of fletynge offryngis, whiche `the sones of Aaron schulen offre bifore the Lord, and bifor the auter. 
\v 15 The preest schal take an handful of wheete flour, which is spreynd with oile, and al the encense which is put on the wheete flour, and he schal brenne it in the auter, in to mynde of swettist odour to the Lord. 
\v 16 Forsothe Aaron with hise sones schal ete the tother part of wheete flour, without sour dow; and he schal ete in the hooli place of the greet street of the tabernacle. 
\v 17 Sotheli herfor it schal not be `diyt with sour dow, for a part therof is offrid in to encense of the Lord; it schal be hooli `of the noumbre of holi thingis, as for synne and for trespas. 
\v 18 Malis oonli of the kynrede of Aaron schulen ete it; it is a lawful thing and euerlastynge in youre generaciouns, of the sacrifice of the Lord; ech man that touchith tho schal be halewyd. 
\v 19 And the Lord spak to Moises, 
\v 20 and seide, This is the offryng of Aaron, and of hise sones, which thei owen offre to the Lord in the day of her anoyntyng \f + \fr 6:20  \ft  In Ebru it is, in the day in whiche he anoyntide him. \f* ; thei schulen offre the tenthe part of ephi of wheete flour, in euerlastynge sacrifice, the myddis therof in the morewtid, and the myddis therof in the euentid; 
\v 21 which schal be spreynt with oile in the friyng panne, and schal be fried. 
\v 22 Sotheli the preest which is successour to the fadir `bi riyt, schal offre it hoot, in to sweteste odour to the Lord; and al it schal be brent in the auter. 
\v 23 For al the sacrifice of preestis schal be wastid with fier, nether ony man schal ete therof. 
\v 24 And the Lord spak to Moises, and seide, 
\v 25 Spek thou to Aaron and to hise sones, This is the lawe of sacrifice for synne; it schal be offrid bifor the Lord, in the place where brent sacrifice is offrid; it is hooli `of the noumbre of hooli thingis. 
\v 26 The preest that offrith it, schal ete it in the hooli place, in the greet street of the tabernacle. 
\v 27 What euer thing schal touche the fleischis therof, it schal be halewid; if a cloth is bispreynt of the blood therof, it schal be waischun in the hooli place. 
\v 28 Sotheli the erthun vessel, in which it is sodun, schal be brokun; that if the vessel is of bras, it schal be scourid, and `schal be waischun with watir. 
\v 29 Ech male of preestis kyn schal ete of the fleischis therof; for it is hooli `of the noumbre of hooli thingis. 
\v 30 Sotheli the sacrifice which is slayn for synne, whos blood is borun in to the tabernacle of witnessyng to clense in the seyntuarie, schal not be etun, but it schal be brent in fier. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1 And this is the lawe of sacrifice for trespas; it is hooli `of the noumbre of hooli thingis. 
\v 2 Therfor where brent sacrifice is offrid, also the sacrifice for trespas schal be slayn; the blood therof schal be sched bi the cumpas of the auter. 
\v 3 Thei schulen offre the tail therof, and the fatnesse that hilith the entrailis, 
\v 4 the twei litle reynes, and the fatnesse which is bisidis ilioun, and the calle of the mawe, with the litle reynes. 
\v 5 And the preest schal brenne tho on the auter; it is encense of the Lord, for trespas. 
\v 6 Ech male of the preestis kyn schal ete these fleischis in the hooli place, for it is hooli `of the noumbre of hooli thingis. 
\v 7 As a sacrifice is offrid for synne, so and for trespas, o lawe schal be of euer eithir sacrifice; it schal perteyne to the preest, that offrith it. 
\v 8 The preest that offrith the beeste of brent sacrifice, schal haue the skyn therof. 
\v 9 And ech sacrifice of wheete flour, which is bakun in an ouene, and what euer is maad redi in a gridile, ethir in a friyng panne, it schal be that preestis, of whom it is offrid, 
\v 10 whether it is spreynt with oile, ethir is drye. To alle the sones of Aaron euene mesure schal be departyd, `to ech `bi hem silf. 
\v 11 This is the lawe of `the sacrifice of pesible thingis, which is offrid to the Lord. 
\v 12 If the offryng is for doyng of thankyngis, thei schulen offre looues without sour dow spreynt with oile, and `therf looues sodun in watir, that ben anoyntid with oile; and thei schulen offre wheete flour bakun, and thinne looues spreynt to gidere with the medlyng of oile. 
\v 13 Also thei schulen offre `looues diyt with sour dow, with the sacrifice of thankyngis which is offrid for pesible thingis; 
\v 14 of whiche \f + \fr 7:14  \ft  In Ebru it is, of alle. \f* o loof schal be offrid to the Lord for the firste fruytis, and it schal be the preestis that schal schede the blood of the sacrifice, 
\v 15 whose fleischis schulen be etun in the same dai, nether ony thing of tho schal dwelle til the morewtid. 
\v 16 If a man offrith a sacrifice bi a vow, ethir bi fre wille, it schal be etun in lijk maner in the same dai; but also if ony thing dwellith `in to the morew, it is leueful to ete it; 
\v 17 sotheli fier schal waaste, whateuer thing the thridde day schal fynde. 
\v 18 If ony man etith in the thridde dai of the fleischis of sacrifice of pesible thingis, his offryng schal be maad voide, nethir it schal profite to the offerere; but rather whateuer soule defoulith hym silf with suche mete, he schal be gilti of `brekyng of the lawe. 
\v 19 Fleisch that touchith ony vnclene thing, schal not be etun, but it schal be brent bi fier; he that is clene, schal ete it. 
\v 20 A pollutid soule, that etith of the fleischis of the sacrifice of pesible thingis, which is offrid to the Lord, schal perische fro hise puplis. 
\v 21 And he that touchith vnclennesse of man, ether of beeste, ether of alle thing that may defoule, and etith of suche fleischis, schal perische fro hise puplis. 
\v 22 And the Lord spak to Moises, 
\v 23 and seide, Speke thou to the sones of Israel, Ye schulen not ete the ynnere fatnesse of a scheep, of an oxe, and of a geet; 
\v 24 ye schulen haue in to dyuerse vsis the ynnere fatnesse of a carkeis deed by it silf, and of that beeste which is takun of a rauenus beeste. 
\v 25 If ony man etith the ynnere fatnesse, that owith to be offrid in to encense of the Lord, he schal perische fro his puple. 
\v 26 Also ye schulen not take in mete the blood of ony beeste, as wel of briddis as of beestis; 
\v 27 ech man that etith blood schal perische fro his puplis. 
\v 28 And the Lord spak to Moises, 
\v 29 and seide, Speke thou to the sones of Israel, He that offrith a sacrifice of pesible thingis to the Lord, offre togidere also a sacrifice, that is, fletynge offryngis therof. 
\v 30 He schal holde in the hondis the ynnere fatnesse of the sacrifice, and the brest; and whanne he hath halewid bothe offrid to the Lord, he schal yyue to the preest, 
\v 31 which schal brenne the ynnere fatnesse on the auter; sotheli the brest schal be Aarons and hise sones; 
\v 32 and the riyt schuldur of the sacrifices of pesible thingis schal turne in to the firste fruytis of the preest. 
\v 33 He that of Aarons sones offrith the blood, and the ynnere fatnesse, schal haue also the riyt schuldur in his porcioun. 
\v 34 For Y haue take fro the sones of Israel the brest of reisyng, and the schuldur of departyng, of the pesible sacrifices `of hem, and Y haue youe to Aaron the preest and to hise sones, bi euerlastynge lawe, of al the puple of Israel.

\v 36 and whiche thingis the Lord comaundide to be youun to hem of the sones of Israel, bi euerlastynge religioun in her generaciouns. 
\v 37 This is the lawe of brent sacrifice, and of sacrifice for synne, and for trespas, and for halewyng, and for the sacrifices of pesible thingis; 
\v 38 which lawe the Lord ordeynede to Moises in the hil of Synay, whanne he comaundide to the sones of Israel that thei schulden offre her offryngis to the Lord, in the deseert of Synay.

\v 1 And the Lord spak to Moises, and seide, Take thou Aaron with hise sones,

\v 3 and thou schalt gedere al the cumpanye to the dore of the tabernacle. 
\v 4 Moises dide as the Lord comaundide; and whanne al the company was gaderid bifor the yatis of the tabernacle, he seide, 
\v 5 This is the word which the Lord comaundid to be don. 
\v 6 And anoon Moises offride Aaron and hise sones; and whanne he hadde waischun hem, 
\v 7 he clothide the bischop with a lynnun schirte, `and girdide `the bischop with a girdil, and clothide with a coote of iacynt, and `puttide the cloth on the schuldris aboue, 
\v 8 which cloth on the schuldris he boond with a girdil, and `dresside to the racional, wherynne doctryn and truthe was. 
\v 9 And Moises hilide the heed with a mytre, and `settide theronne, ayens the forhed, the goldun plate halewid in halewyng, as the Lord comaundide to hym. 
\v 10 He took also the oile of anoyntyng, with which he anoyntide the tabernacle with al his purtenaunce; 
\v 11 and whanne he hadde halewid and hadde spreynt the auter seuen sithes, he anoyntide it, and halewide with oile alle the vessels therof, and the `greet waischyng vessel with his foundement. 
\v 12 Which oile he schedde on `the heed of Aaron, and anoyntide hym, and halewide. 
\v 13 And he clothide with lynnun cootis, and girdide with girdils `his sones offrid, and settide on mytris, as the Lord comaundide. 
\v 14 He offeride also a calf for synne; and whanne Aaron and hise sones hadden put her hondis on `that calf, 
\v 15 he offride it, and drow up blood; and whanne the fyngur was dippid, he touchide the corneris of the auter bi cumpas; whanne the auter was clensid and halewid, he schedde the `residue blood at the `foundement therof. 
\v 16 Sotheli he brent on the auter the ynnere fatnesse that was on the entrails, and the calle of the mawe, and the twei litle reynes with her litle fatnessis; 
\v 17 and he brente without the castels the calf, with the skyn, fleischis, and dung, as the Lord comaundide. 
\v 18 He offride also a ram in to brent sacrifice; and whanne Aaron and hise sones hadden set her hondis on the heed therof, 
\v 19 he offride it, and schedde the blood therof bi the cumpas of the auter. 
\v 20 And he kittide thilke ram in to gobetis, and brente with fier the heed therof, and membris, 
\v 21 and ynnere fatnesse, whanne the entrails and feet weren waischun bifore; and he brente al the ram togidere on the auter, for it was the brent sacrifice of swettiste odour to the Lord, as the Lord comaundide to hym. 
\v 22 He offride also the secounde ram, in to the halewyng of preestis; and Aaron and hise sones puttiden her hondis on the heed therof. 
\v 23 And whanne Moises hadde offrid the ram, he took of the blood, and touchide the laste part of the riyt eere of Aaron, and the thombe of his riyt hond, in lijk maner and of the foot. 
\v 24 He offride also `the sones of Aaron. And whanne he hadde touchid of the blood of the ram offrid the laste part of `the riyt eeris of alle, and `the thombis of the riyt hond and foot, he schedde the `tothir blood on the auter bi cumpas. 
\v 25 Sotheli he departide the ynnere fatnesse, and the taile, and al the fatnesse that hilith the entrails, and the calle of the mawe, and the twey reynes with her fatnessis and with the riyt schuldur. 
\v 26 Forsothe he took of the panyere of therf looues, that was bifor the Lord, looues without sour dow, and a cake spreynt with oile, and he puttide looues first sodun in watir and aftirward fried in oile on the ynnere fatnesse, and the riyt schuldur; and bitook alle thingis togidere to Aaron, 
\v 27 and to hise sones. And aftir that thei `reisiden tho bifore the Lord, 
\v 28 eft `he brente tho takun of her hondis, on the auter of brent sacrifice, for it was the offryng of halewyng, in to the odour of swetnesse of sacrifice `into his part to the Lord. 
\v 29 He took also the brest of the ram of consecracioun in to his part, and reiside it bifor the Lord, as the Lord comaundide to hym. 
\v 30 And he took the oynement, and blood that was in the auter, and `spreynte on Aaron, and hise clothis, and on `the sones of hym, and on her clothis. 
\v 31 And whanne he hadde halewid hem in her clothing, he comaundide to hem, and seide, Sethe ye fleischis bifor the `yatis of the tabernacle, and there ete ye tho; also ete ye the looues of halewyng, that ben put in the panyere, as God comaundide to me, `and seide, Aaron and hise sones schulen ete tho looues; 
\v 32 sotheli whateuer thing is residue of the fleisch and looues, fier schal waste. 
\v 33 Also ye schulen not go out of the dore of the tabernacle in seuene daies, til to the day in which the tyme of youre halewyng schal be fillid; for the halewyng is endid in seuene dayes, 
\v 34 as it is doon in present tyme, that the riytfulnesse of sacrifice were fillid. 
\v 35 Ye schulen dwelle dai and nyyt in the tabernacle, and ye schulen kepe the kepyngis of the Lord, that ye die not; for so it is comaundid to me. 
\v 36 And Aaron and hise sones diden alle thingis, whiche the Lord spak bi the hond of Moises.

\v 5 Therfor thei token alle thingis, whiche Moises comaundide, to the dore of the tabernacle, where, whanne al the multitude stood, 
\v 6 Moises seide, This is the word, which the Lord comaundide, do ye, and his glorie schal appere to you. 
\v 7 And Moises seide to Aaron, Neiye thou to the auter, and offre thou for thi synne; offre thou brent sacrifice, and preye for thee, and for the puple; and whanne thou hast slayn the sacrifice of the puple, preye thou for hem, as the Lord comaundide. 
\v 8 And anoon Aaron neiyede to the auter, and offride a calf for his synne; 
\v 9 whos blood hise sones offriden to him, in which blood he dippide the fyngur, and touchide the hornes of the auter,\f + \fr 9:9  \ft  the auter, that is, of brent sacrifice. \f* and schedde the residue at the foundement therof; 
\v 10 and he brente on the auter the ynnere fatnesse, and litle reynes, and the calle of the mawe, as the Lord comaundide to Moises. 
\v 11 Forsothe he brente bi fier without the castels the fleischis and skyn therof. 
\v 12 And he offride the beeste of brent sacrifice, and hise sones offriden to hym the blood therof, which he schedde bi the cumpas of the auter; 
\v 13 thei offriden also thilke sacrifice kit in to gobetis, with the heed, and alle membris; and he brente bi fier alle these thingis on the auter, 
\v 14 whanne the entrailis and feet weren waischun bifor with watir. 
\v 15 And he offride and killide a buk of geet, for the synne of the puple; and whanne the auter was clensid, 
\v 16 he made brent sacrifice, 
\v 17 and addide in to the sacrifice fletynge offryngis that ben offrid togidere; and he brente tho on the auter, without cerymonyes of brent sacrifice of the morewtid. 
\v 18 He offride also an oxe, and a ram, pesible sacrifices of the puple; and hise sones offriden to hym the blood, which he schedde bi the cumpas of the auter. 
\v 19 Forsothe thei puttiden on the brestis the ynnere fatnesse of the oxe, and the tail of the ram, and the litle reynes with her fatnessis, and the calle of the mawe. 
\v 20 And whanne the ynnere fatnessis weren brent in the auter, 
\v 21 Aaron departide the brestis, and the riyt schuldris of tho, and reiside bifor the Lord, as Moises comaundide. 
\v 22 And he streiyte forth hondis to the puple, and blesside it; and so whanne the sacrifices for synne, and brent sacrifices, and pesible sacrifices, weren fillid, he cam doun. 
\v 23 Sotheli Moyses and Aaron entriden in to the tabernacle of witnessyng, and yeden out aftirward, and blessiden the puple; and the glorie of the Lord apperide to al the multitude. 
\v 24 And lo! fier yede out fro the Lord, and deuouride the brent sacrifice, and the ynnere fatnesses that weren on the auter; and whanne the cumpanyes hadden seyn this thing, thei preiseden the Lord, `and felden on her faces. 
\c 10

\v 3 And Moises seide to Aaron, This thing it is which the Lord spak, Y schal be halewid in hem that neiyen to me, and Y schal be glorified in the siyt of al the puple; which thing Aaron herde, and was stille. 
\v 4 Sotheli whanne Moises hadde clepid Mysael and Elisaphan, the sones of Oziel, brother of Aaron's fadir, he seide to hem, Go ye, and take awey youre britheren fro the siyt of seyntuarie, and bere ye out of the castels. 
\v 5 And anoon thei yeden, and token hem, as thei laien clothid with lynnun cootis, and castiden out, as it was comaundid to hem.

\v 7 But ye schulen not go out of the yatis of the tabernacle, ellis ye schulen perische; for the oile of hooli anoyntyng is on you. Whiche diden alle thingis bi the comaundement of Moises. 
\v 8 Also the Lord seide to Aaron, 
\v 9 Thou and thi sones schulen not drynke wyn, and al thing that may make drunkun, whanne ye schulen entre in to the tabernacle of witnessing, lest ye dien; for it is euerlastynge comaundement in to youre generaciouns,

\v 11 and that ye teche the sones of Israel alle my lawful thingis, whiche the Lord spak to hem bi the hond of Moyses. 
\v 12 And Moises spak to Aaron, and to Eliazar and Ythamar, hise sones, that weren residue, Take ye the sacrifice that lefte of the offryng of the Lord, and ete ye it with out sour dow, bisidis the auter, for it is hooli `of the noumbre of hooli thingis. 
\v 13 Sotheli ye schulen ete in the hooli place that that is youun to thee and to thi sones, of the offryngis of the Lord, as it is comaundid to me Also thou,

\v 16 Among these thingis whanne Moises souyte the `buk of geet that was offrid for synne, he foond it brent, and he was wrooth ayens Eliazar and Ythamar, `the sones of Aaron that weren left. 
\v 17 And he seide, Whi eten not ye the sacrifice for synne in the hooli place, which sacrifice is hooli `of the noumbre of hooli thingis, and is youun to you, that ye bere the wickydnesse of the multitude, and preye for it in the siyt of the Lord; 
\v 18 moost sithen of the blood therof is not borun yn with ynne hooli thingis, and ye ouyten ete it in the seyntuarie, as it is comaundid to me?

\v 4 Sotheli if schynyng whijtnesse is in the skyn, nethir is lower than the tother fleisch, and the heeris ben of the formere colour, the preest schal close hym seuene daies; 
\v 5 and schal biholde hym in the seuenthe dai, and sotheli if the lepre wexith not ferther, nethir passith the formere termes in the fleisch, eft the preest schal close hym ayen seuene other daies; 
\v 6 and schal biholde in the seuenthe day, if the lepre is derkere, and wexith not in the fleisch, the preest schal clense hym,\f + \fr 13:6  \ft  the prest schal clense him, that is, schal deme him [to be] cleene. \f* for it is a scabbe; and the man schal waische hise clothis, and he schal be clene. 
\v 7 That if the lepre wexith eft, aftir that he is seyn of the preest, and is yoldun to clennesse, he schal be brouyt to the preest, and schal be demed of vnclennesse. 
\v 8 If the wounde of lepre is in man, he schal be brouyt to the preest, and he schal se the man;

\v 11 and he schal not close eft, for it is of opyn vnclennesse. 
\v 12 But if lepre rennynge about in the skyn `flourith out, and hilith al the fleisch, fro the heed til to the feet, what euer thing fallith vndur the siyt of iyen; the preest schal biholde hym,

\v 14 Sotheli whanne quyk fleisch apperith in hym, 
\v 15 thanne he schal be defoulid bi the doom of the preest, and he schal be arettid among vncleene men; for quyk fleisch is vnclene, if it is spreynt with lepre. 
\v 16 That if the fleisch is turned eft in to whijtnesse, and hilith al the man, 
\v 17 the preest schal biholde hym, and schal deme, that he is cleene.

\v 21 That if the heer is of the former colour, and the signe of wounde is sumdeel derk, and is not lowere than the `nyy fleisch, the preest schal close the man seuene daies; 
\v 22 and sotheli, if it wexith, the preest schal deme the man of lepre;

\v 24 Fleisch and skyn, which the fier hath brent, and is heelid, and hath a whijt ethir reed `signe of wounde, 
\v 25 the preest schal biholde it, and lo! if it is turned in to whijtnesse, and the place therof is lowere than the tothir skyn, the preest schal defoule the man, for a wounde of lepre is bred in the `signe of wounde. 
\v 26 That if the colour of heeris is not chaungid, nether the wounde is lowere than the tother fleisch, and thilke spice of lepre is sumdeel derk, the preest schal close the man bi seuene daies; 
\v 27 and in the seuenthe dai he schal biholde; if the lepre wexith in the fleisch, the preest schal defoule the man; 
\v 28 ellis if the whijtnesse stondith in his place, and is not cleer ynow, it is a wounde of brennyng, and therfor the man schal be clensid, for it is a signe of brennyng. 
\v 29 A man ethir womman, in whos heed ether beerd lepre buriounneth, the preest schal se hem; 
\v 30 and if the place is lowere than the tothir fleisch, and the heer is whijt, `and is sotilere, `ether smallere, than it is wont, the preest schal defoule hem, for it is lepre of the heed, and of the beerd.

\v 33 the man schal be schauun, without the place of wem, and he schal be closid eft bi seuene othere daies. 
\v 34 If in the seuenthe day the wounde is seyn to haue stonde in his place, nether is lowere than the tother fleisch, the preest schal clense the man; and whanne his clothis ben waischun, he schal be cleene. 
\v 35 Ellis if aftir the clensyng a spotte wexith eft in the skyn, 
\v 36 the preest schal no more enquere, whether the heer is chaungid in to whijt colour, for apeertli he is vncleene. 
\v 37 Sotheli if the spotte stondith, and the heeris ben blake, knowe the preest that the man is heelid, and tristili `pronounce he the man cleene. 
\v 38 A man ethir a womman, in whos skyn whijtnesse apperith, the preest schal biholde hem; 
\v 39 if he perseyueth, that whijtnesse `sum deel derk schyneth in the skyn, wite he, that it is no lepre, but a spotte of whijt colour, and that the man is cleene. 
\v 40 A man of whos heed heeris fleten awei, is calu, and clene; 
\v 41 and if heeris fallen fro the forheed, he is ballid, 
\v 42 and is cleene; ellis if in the ballidnesse bifore, ether in the ballidnesse bihynde, whijt ether reed colour is bred, and the preest seeth this, 
\v 43 he schal condempne the man without doute of lepre, which is bred in the ballidnesse. 
\v 44 Therfor whoeuer is defoulid with lepre, and is departid at the doom of the preest, 
\v 45 he schal haue hise clothis vnsewid, bareheed, the mouth hilid with a cloth, he schal crye hym silf defoulid, and viyl; 
\v 46 in al tyme in which he is lepre and vnclene, he schal dwelle aloone without the castels. 
\v 47 A wollun cloth, ethir lynnun, that hath lepre in the warp,

\v 49 if it is corrupt with a whijt spotte, ethir reed, it schal be arettid lepre, and it schal be schewid to the preest; 
\v 50 which schal close it biholden bi seuene daies. 
\v 51 And eft he schal biholde in the seuenthe dai, and if he perseyueth, that it wexide, it schal be contynuel lepre; he schal deme the cloth defoulid, and al thing in which it is foundun; 
\v 52 and therfor the cloth schal be brent in flawmes. 
\v 53 That if he seeth that the spotte wexide not, he schal comaunde, 
\v 54 and thei schulen waische that thing wherynne the lepre is, and he schal close it ayen bi seuene othere daies; 
\v 55 and whanne he seeth the formere face not turned ayen, netheles that nether the lepre wexede, he schal deme that thing vnclene, and he schal brenne it in fier, for lepre is sched in the ouer part of the cloth, ether thorouy al. 
\v 56 Ellis if the `place of lepre is derkere, aftir that the cloth is waischun, he schal breke awey that place, and schal departe fro the hool.

\v 1 And the Lord spak to Moises, and seide, This is the custom of a leprouse man, 
\v 2 whanne he schal be clensid. He schal be brouyt to the preest, 
\v 3 which preest schal go out of the castels, and whanne he schal fynde that the lepre is clensid, 
\v 4 he schal comaunde to the man which is clensid, that he offre for hym silf twei quyke sparewis, whiche it is leueful to ete, and a `tree of cedre, and vermylyoun,\f + \fr 14:4  \ft  vermyloun, that is, a reed threed. \f* and isope. 
\v 5 And the preest schal comaunde that oon of the sparewes be offrid in `a vessel of erthe, 
\v 6 on quyke watris; sotheli he schal dippe the tother sparewe quyk with the `tre of cedre, and with a reed threed and ysope, in the blood of the sparewe offrid, 
\v 7 with which he schal sprenge seuensithis hym that schal be clensid, that he be purgid riytfuli; and he schal delyuere the quyk sparewe, that it fle in to the feeld. 
\v 8 And whanne the man hath waische hise clothis, he schal schaue alle the heeris of the bodi, and he schal be waischun in watir, and he schal be clensid, and he schal entre in to the castels; so oneli that he dwelle without his tabernacle bi seuene daies; 
\v 9 and that in the seuenthe dai he schaue the heeris of the heed, and the beerd, and brewis, and the heeris of al the bodi. And whanne the clothis and bodi ben waischun, 
\v 10 eft in the eiyetithe dai he schal take twei lambren without wem, and a scheep of o yeer without wem, and thre dymes of wheete flour, in to sacrifice, which be spreynte with oile, and bi it silf a sextarie of oyle. 
\v 11 And whanne the preest, that purgith the man, hath set hym and alle hise thingis bifor the Lord, in the dore of the tabernacle of witnessyng, he schal take a lomb, 
\v 12 and schal offre it for trespas, and schal offre the sextarie of oyle; and whanne alle thingis ben offrid bifor the Lord, 
\v 13 he schal offre the lomb, where the sacrifice for synne and the brent sacrifice is wont to be offrid, that is, in the hooli place; for as for synne so and for trespas the offryng perteyneth to the preest; it is hooli of the noumbre of hooli thingis. 
\v 14 And the preest schal take of the blood of sacrifice which is offrid for trespas, and schal putte on the laste part of the riyt eere `of hym which is clensid, and on the thumbis of the riyt hond and foot. 
\v 15 And he schal putte of the sextarie of oyle in to his left hond, 
\v 16 and he schal dippe the riyt fyngur therynne, and schal sprynge seuensithis bifor the Lord. 
\v 17 Sotheli he schal schede that that is residue of the oile in the left hond, on the laste part of the riyt eere `of hym which is clensid, and on the thombis of the riyt hond and foot, and on the blood which is sched for trespas, 
\v 18 and on the heed `of hym. 
\v 19 And the preest schal preye for hym bifor the Lord, and schal make sacrifice for synne; thanne he schal offre brent sacrifice, 
\v 20 and schal putte it in the auter with hise fletynge sacrifices, and the man schal be clensid riytfuli. 
\v 21 That if he is pore, and his hoond may not fynde tho thingis that ben seid, he schal take for trespas a lomb to offryng, that the preest preie for him, and the tenthe part of wheete flour spreynt togidire with oile in to sacrifice, and a sextarie of oile, 
\v 22 and twei turtlis, ethir twei `briddis of culueris, of whiche oon be for synne, and the tothir in to brent sacrifice; 
\v 23 and he schal offre tho in the eiytthe dai of his clensyng to the preest, at the dore of tabernacle of witnessyng bifor the Lord. 
\v 24 And the preest schal take the lomb for trespas, and the sextarie of oile, and schal reise togidere; 
\v 25 and whanne the lomb is offrid, he schal putte of the blood therof on the laste part of the riyt eere `of hym that is clensid, and on the thumbis of his riyt hond and foot. 
\v 26 Sotheli the preest putte the part of oile in to his left hond, 
\v 27 in which he schal dippe the fyngur of the riyt hond, and schal sprynge seuensithes ayens the Lord; 
\v 28 and the preest schal touche the laste part of the riyt eere `of hym that is clensid, and the thombe of the riyt hond and foot, in the place of blood which is sched out for trespas. 
\v 29 Sotheli he schal putte the tother part of oile, which is in the left hond, on the `heed of the man clensid, that he plese the Lord for hym. 
\v 30 And he schal offre a turtle, ethir a culuer brid, 
\v 31 oon for trespas, and the tothir in to brent sacrifice, with her fletynge offryngis. 
\v 32 This is the sacrifice of a leprouse man, that may not haue alle thingis in to the clensyng of hym silf. 
\v 33 And the Lord spak to Moises and Aaron, and seide, 
\v 34 Whanne ye han entrid in to the lond of Canaan, which lond Y schal yyue to you in to possessioun, if the wounde of lepre is in the housis, 
\v 35 he schal go, whos the hous is, `and schal telle to the preest, and schal seie, It semeth to me, that as a wound of lepre is in myn hous. 
\v 36 And the preest schal comaunde, `that thei bere out of the hous alle thingis bifore that he entre in to it, `and me se where it be lepre, lest alle thingis that ben in the hows, be maad vnclene; and the preest schal entre aftirward, that he se the lepre of the hows. 
\v 37 And whanne he seeth in the wallis therof as litle valeis `foule bi palenesse, ethir bi reednesse, and lowere than the tother hiyere part, 
\v 38 he schal go out at the dore of the hows, and anoon he schal close it bi seuene daies. 
\v 39 And he schal turne ayen in the seuenthe day, and schal se it; if he fyndith that the lepre encreesside, 
\v 40 he schal comaunde that the stoonys be cast out, in whyche the lepre is, and that tho stonys be cast out of the citee in an vncleene place.

\v 43 But if aftir that the stoonus ben takun awey, and the dust is borun out, 
\v 44 and othere erthe is daubid, the preest entrith, and seeth the lepre turned ayen, and the wallis spreynt with spottis, the lepre is stidfastly dwellynge, and the hows is vnclene; 
\v 45 which hows thei schulen destrye anoon, and thei schulen caste out of the citee, in an vnclene place, the stoonys therof, and the trees, and al the dust. 
\v 46 He that entrith in to the hous, whanne it is schit, schal be vnclene `til to euentid,

\v 49 And in the clensyng therof he schal take twey sparewis, and `a tre of cedre, and `a reed threed, and isope. 
\v 50 And whanne o sparewe is offrid in a vessel of erthe, on quyk watris, 
\v 51 he schal take the `tre of cedre, and ysope, and reed threed, and the quyk sparewe, and he schal dippe alle thingis in the blood of the sparewe offrid, and in lyuynge watris; 
\v 52 and he schal sprynge the hows seuen sithis; and he schal clense it as wel in the blood of the sparewe as in lyuynge watris, and in the quyk sparewe, and in the `tre of cedre, and in ysope, and `reed threed. 
\v 53 And whanne he hath left the sparewe to fle in to the feeld frely, he schal preye for the hows, and it schal be clensid riytfuli. 
\v 54 This is the lawe of al lepre,

\v 10 Lo! forsothe the sone of a womman of Israel, whom sche childide of a man Egipcian, yede out among the sones of Israel, and chidde in the castels with a man of Israel,

\v 15 And thou schalt speke to the sones of Israel, A man that cursith his God,

\v 10 And thou schalt halewe the fiftithe yeer, and thou schalt clepe remissioun to alle the dwellers of thi lond; for thilke yeer is iubilee; a man schal turne ayen to hys possessioun, and ech man schal go ayen to the firste meynee, 
\v 11 for it is iubilee, and the fiftithe yeer. Ye schulen not sowe, nether ye schulen repe thingis, that comen forth freli in the feeld, and ye schulen not gadere the firste fruytis of vyndage, for the halewyng of iubilee; 
\v 12 but anoon ye schulen ete thingis takun awey; 
\v 13 in the yeer of iubilee alle men go ayen to her possessiouns. 
\v 14 Whanne thou schalt sille ony thing to thi citeseyn, ether schalt bie of hym, make thou not sory thi brother, but bi the noumbre of `yeeris of iubile thou schalt bie of him, 
\v 15 and bi the rekenyng of fruytis he schal sille to thee. 
\v 16 Bi as myche as mo yeeris dwellen after the iubilee, by so myche also the prijs schal encreesse, and bi as myche as thou noumbrist lesse of tyme, bi so myche and the biyng schal cost lesse; for he schal sille to thee the time of fruytis. 
\v 17 Nyle ye turment men of youre lynagis, but ech man drede his God; for Y am youre Lord God. 
\v 18 Do ye my comaundementis, and kepe ye my domes, and fille ye tho, that ye moun dwelle in his lond without ony drede, 
\v 19 and that the erthe brynge forth hise fruytis to you, whiche ye schulen ete `til to fulnesse, and drede not the assailyng of ony man. 
\v 20 That if ye seien, what schulen we ete in the seuenthe yeer, if we sowen not, nether gaderen oure fruytis? 
\v 21 Y schal yyue my blessyng to you in the sixte yeer, and it schal make fruytis of three yeer; 
\v 22 and ye schulen sowe in the eiyte yeer, and ye schulen ete elde fruytis `til to the nynthe yeer; til newe thingis comen forth ye schulen ete the elde thingis. 
\v 23 Also the lond schal not be seeld `in to with outen ende, for it is myn, and ye ben my comelyngis and tenauntis; 
\v 24 wherfor al the cuntre of youre possessioun schal be seeld vndur the condicioun of ayenbiyng. 
\v 25 If thi brother is maad pore, and sillith his litil possessioun, and his nyy kynesman wole, he may ayenbie that that he seelde;

\v 28 That if his hond fynde not, that he yelde the prijs, the biere schal haue that that he bouyte, `til to the yeer of iubilee; for in that yeer ech sillyng schal go ayen to the lord, and to the firste weldere. 
\v 29 He that sillith his hows, with ynne the wallis of a citee, schal haue licence to ayenbie til o yeer be fillid; 
\v 30 if he ayenbieth not, and the sercle of the yeer is passid, the biere schal welde it, and his eiris `in to with outen ende, and it schal not mow be ayenbouyt, ye, in the iubilee. 
\v 31 Forsothe if the hows is in a town `that hath not wallis, it schal be seeld bi the lawe of feeldis; sotheli if it is not ayenbouyt in the iubilee, it schal turne ayen to `his lord. 
\v 32 The howsis of dekenes, that ben in citees, moun euer be ayenbouyt; if tho ben not ayenbouyt,

\v 35 If thi brother is maad pore, and feble in power, and thou resseyuest hym as a comelyng and pilgrym, and he lyueth with thee, 
\v 36 take thou not vsuris of hym, nether more than thou hast youe; drede thou thi God, that thi brothir mai lyue anentis thee. 
\v 37 Thou schalt not yyue to hym thi money to vsure, and thou schalt not axe ouer `aboundaunce, ether encrees ouer of fruytis; 
\v 38 Y am youre Lord God, that ladde you out of the lond of Egipt, that Y schulde yyue to you the lond of Canaan, and that Y schulde be youre God. 
\v 39 If thi brother compellid bi pouert sillith hym silf to thee, thou schalt not oppresse hym bi seruage of seruauntis, 
\v 40 but he schal be as an hirid man and tenaunt; `til to the yeer of iubilee he schal worche at thee, 
\v 41 and aftirward he schal go out with his fre children, and he schal turne ayen to the kynrede, and to `the possessioun of his fadris. 
\v 42 For thei ben my seruauntis, and Y ledde hem out of the lond of Egipt; thei schulen not be seeld bi the condicioun of seruauntis; 
\v 43 turmente thou not hem bi thi power, but drede thou thi Lord. 
\v 44 A seruaunt and handmaide be to you of naciouns that ben in youre cumpas, 
\v 45 and of comelyngis that ben pilgrimys at you, ether thei that ben borun of hem in youre lond; ye schulen haue these seruauntis, 
\v 46 and bi riyt of eritage ye schulen `sende ouer to aftir comeris, and ye schulen welde with outen ende; sothely oppresse ye not bi power youre britheren, the sones of Israel. 
\v 47 If the hond of a comelyng and of a pilgrim wexith strong at you, and thi brother is maad pore, and sillith hym silf to hym, 
\v 48 ether to ony of his kyn, he may be ayenbouyt aftir the sillyng; he that wole of hise britheren, ayenbie hym; bothe `the brother of fadir, 
\v 49 and the sone of `the fadris brother, and kynesman, and alye. Ellis if also he schal mow, he schal ayenbie hym silf, 
\v 50 while the yeeris ben rykenid oneli fro the tyme of his sillyng `til in to the yeer of iubylee; and while the money, for which he was seeld, is rikenyd bi the noumbre of yeeris, and while the hire of an hirid man is rikenyd. 
\v 51 If mo yeeris ben that dwellen `til to the iubilee, bi these yeeris he schal yelde also the prijs; if fewe yeeris ben, 
\v 52 he schal sette rikenyng with hym bi the noumbre of yeeris; 
\v 53 and he schal yeelde to the biere that that is residue of yeeris, while tho yeeris, bi whiche he seruyde bifore, ben rikenyd for hiris; he schal not turmente `that Ebreu violentli in thi siyt. 
\v 54 That if he may not be ayenbouyt bi this, he schal go out with his free children in the `yeer of iubilee; for the sones of Israel ben myn seruauntis,

\v 8 fyue of youre men schulen pursue an hundrid aliens, and an hundrid of you schulen pursue ten thousande; youre enemyes schulen falle bi swerd in youre siyt. 
\v 9 Y schal biholde you, and Y schal make you to encreesse; ye schulen be multiplied; and Y schal make stedfast my couenaunt with you; 
\v 10 ye schulen ete the eldest of elde thingis, and ye schulen caste forth elde thingis, whanne newe thingis schulen come aboue; 
\v 11 Y schal sette my tabernacle in the myddis of you, and my soule schal not caste you awey; 
\v 12 Y schal go among you, and Y schal be youre God, and ye schulen be a puple to me. 
\v 13 Y am youre Lord God, that ledde you out of the lond of Egipcians, that ye schulden not serue hem, and which haue broke the chaynes of youre nollis, that ye schulde go vpriyt. 
\v 14 That if ye heren not me, nether doon alle myn heestis, 
\v 15 and if ye forsaken my lawis, and despisen my domes, that ye doon not tho thingis that ben ordeyned of me, and that ye brengen my couenaunt to auoydyng, also Y schal do these thingis to you; 
\v 16 Y schal visyte you swiftly in nedynesse and brennyng, which schal turment youre iyen, and schal waste youre lyues; in veyn ye schulen sowe seed, that schal be deuourid of enemyes; 
\v 17 Y schal sette my face ayens you, and ye schulen falle bifor youre enemyes, and ye schulen be sugetis to hem that haten you; ye schulen fle, while no man pursueth. 
\v 18 But if nether so ye obeyen to me, Y schal adde youre chastisyngis seuenfold for youre synnes; 
\v 19 and Y schal al tobreke the pride of youre hardnesse, and Y schal yyue to you heuene aboue as of yrun, and the erthe as bras; 
\v 20 youre trauel schal be wastid in veyn, nether the erthe schal brynge forth fruyt, nethir trees schulen yyue applis. 
\v 21 If ye goon contrarie to me, nether wolen here me, Y schal adde youre woundis til in to seuenfold for youre synnes; 
\v 22 Y schal sende out in to you cruel beestis of the feeld, that schulen waste you and youre beestis, and schulen brynge alle thingis to fewnesse, and youre weies schulen be forsakun. 
\v 23 That if nether so ye wolen resseyue doctryn, but goon contrarie to me, 
\v 24 also Y schal go aduersarie ayens you, and Y schal smyte you seuen sithis for youre synnes; 
\v 25 and Y schal brynge yn on you the swerd, vengere of my boond of pees \f + \fr 26:25  \ft  that is, for the brekyng of my bond of pees. \f* ; and whanne ye fleen in to citees, Y schal sende pestilence in the myddis of you, and ye schulen be bitakun in the hondis of enemyes,

\v 27 But if nethir bi these thingis ye heren me, but goon ayens me, 
\v 28 and Y schal go ayens you in contrarie woodnesse, and Y schal chastise you bi seuene veniaunces for youre synnes,

\v 32 and Y schal destrye youre lond, and youre enemyes schulen be astonyed theronne, whanne thei schulen be enhabiters therof; 
\v 33 forsothe Y schal scatere you in to folkis, ether hethen men, and Y schal drawe out of the schethe the swerd aftir you, and youre lond schal be forsakun, and youre citees schulen be cast doun. 
\v 34 Thanne `hise sabatis schulen plese the erthe, in alle the daies of his wildirnesse; whanne ye ben in the lond of enemyes, 
\v 35 it schal `kepe sabat, and schal reste in the sabatis of his wildirnesse, for it restide not in youre sabatis, whanne ye dwelliden therynne. 
\v 36 And Y schal yyue drede in `the hertis of hem, whiche schulen abide of you, in the cuntreis of enemyes; the sown of a leef fleynge schal make hem aferd, and so thei schulen fle it as a swerd; thei schulen falle, while noon pursueth, 
\v 37 and alle schulen falle on her britheren, as fleynge bateils; no man of you schal be hardi to ayenstonde enemyes; 
\v 38 ye schulen perische among hethen men, and the lond of enemyes schal waaste you. 
\v 39 That if summe of these Jewes dwellen, thei schulen faile in her wickidnessis, in the lond of her enemyes, and thei schulen be turmentid for the synne of her fadris, 
\v 40 and for her owne synnes, til thei knoulechen her wickidnesses, and han mynde of her yuels, bi whiche thei trespassiden ayens me, and yeden contrarie to me. 
\v 41 Therfor and Y schal go ayens hem, and Y schal brynge hem in to the lond of enemyes, til the vncircumcidid soule of hem be aschamed; thanne thei schulen preie for her wickidnesses, 
\v 42 and Y schal haue mynde of my boond of pees, which Y couenauntide with Jacob, Ysaac, and Abraham; also Y schal be myndeful of the lond, 
\v 43 which, whanne it is left of hem, schal plese to it silf in `his sabatis, and schal suffre wildirnesse for hem; forsothe thei schulen preye for her synnes, for thei castiden awey my domes, and despyseden my lawis; 
\v 44 netheles, yhe, whanne thei weren in `the lond of enemyes, Y castide not hem awey outirli, nether Y dispiside hem, so that thei weren wastid, and that Y made voide my couenaunt with hem; for Y am the Lord God of hem. 
\v 45 And Y schal haue mynde of my formere boond of pees, whanne Y ledde hem out of the lond of Egipt, in the siyt of hethene men, that Y schulde be her God; Y am the Lord God. 
\v 46 These ben the comaundementis, and domes, and lawis, whiche the Lord yaf bitwixe hym silf and bitwixe the sones of Israel, in the hil of Synay, bi the hond of Moises. 
\c 27  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spak to Moises and seide, Speke thou to the sones of Israel, 
\v 2 and thou schalt seye to hem, A man that makith avow, and bihetith his soule to God, schal yyue the priys vndur valu, ether preisyng. 
\v 3 If it is a male, fro the twentithe yeer `til to the sixtithe yeer, he schal yyue fifti siclis of siluer, at the mesure of seyntuarie, if it is a womman, 
\v 4 sche schal yyue thretti siclis; 
\v 5 forsothe fro the fifthe yeer `til to the twentithe yeer, a male schal yyue twenti cyclis, a womman schal yyue ten ciclis; 
\v 6 fro o monethe `til to the fifthe yeer, fyue ciclis schulen be youun for a male, thre ciclis for a womman; 
\v 7 a male of sixti yeer and ouer schal yyue fiftene ciclis, a womman schal yyue ten cyclis. 
\v 8 If it is a pore man, and may not yelde the valu, he schal stonde bifor the preest, and as myche as the preest preisith, and seeth that the pore man may yelde, so myche he schal yyue. 
\v 9 Forsothe if ony man avowith a beeste, that may be offrid to the Lord, it schal be hooli, 
\v 10 and schal not mow be chaungid, that is, nethir a betere for `an yuel, nether `a worse for a good; and if he chaungith it, bothe that, that is chaungid, and that, for which it is chaungid, schal be halewid to the Lord. 
\v 11 Sotheli if ony man avowith an vncleene beeste, that may not be offrid to the Lord, it schal be brouyt bifor the preest, 
\v 12 and the preest schal deme whether it is good ether yuel, and schal sette the prijs; 
\v 13 which prijs if he that offrith wole yyue, he schal adde the fifthe part ouer the valu. 
\v 14 If a man avowith his hows, and halewith it to the Lord, the preest schal biholde, `whether it is good ether yuel, and bi the prijs, which is ordeyned of hym, it schal be seld; 
\v 15 sotheli if he that avowide wole ayen-bie it, he schal yyue the fifthe part of the valu aboue, and he schal haue the hows. 
\v 16 That if he avowith the feeld of his possessioun, and halewith to the Lord, the prijs schal be demed bi the mesure of seed; if the feeld is sowun with thritti buyschels of barli, it schal be seeld for fifti siclys of siluer. 
\v 17 If he auowith the feeld anoon for the yeer of the iubilee bigynnynge, as myche as it may be worth, bi so myche it schal be preisid; 
\v 18 but if it be after `sum part of tyme, the preest schal rykene the money bi the noumbre of yeeris that ben residue `til to the iubilee, and it schal be withdrawun of the prijs. 
\v 19 That if he that avowide wole ayenbie the feeld, he schal adde the fyuethe part of the money preisid, and he schal welde it; 
\v 20 but if he nyle ayenbie, but it is seeld to ony othir man, he that avowide schal `no more mowe ayenbie it; 
\v 21 for whanne the dai of iubilee cometh, it schal be halewid to the Lord, and the possessioun halewid perteyneth to the riyt of preestis. 
\v 22 If the feeld is bouyt, and is not of the possessioun of grettere men, 
\v 23 and is halewid to the Lord, the preest schal determyne the prijs bi the noumbre of yeeris `til to the iubilee, and he that avowide the feeld schal yyue the prijs to the Lord; 
\v 24 forsothe in the iubilee it schal turne ayen to the formere lord that seelde it, and `haue he in to the eritage of his possessioun. 
\v 25 `Ech preisyng schal be peisid bi the sicle of seyntuarie; a sicle hath twenti halpens. 
\v 26 No man may halewe and avowe the firste gendrid thingis that perteynen to the Lord, whether it is oxe, whether scheep, tho ben the Lordis part. 
\v 27 That if the beeste is vncleene, he that offride schal ayenbie by his valu, and he schal adde the fyuethe part of prijs; if he nyle ayenbie, it schal be seeld to another man, as myche euer as it is `set at valu. 
\v 28 Al thing which is halewid to the Lord, whether it is man, whether beeste, whether feeld,\f + \fr 27:28  \ft  In Ebreu it is, feeld of his eritage. \f* it schal not be seeld, nether it schal mow be ayenbouyt; whateuer thing is halewid onys, it schal be hooli of the noumbre of hooli thingis to the Lord, 
\v 29 and ech halewyng which is offrid of man, schal not be ayenbouyt, but it schal die bi deeth. 
\v 30 Alle the tithis of erthe, whether of fruytis, whether of applis of trees, ben the Lordis part, and ben halewid to hym; 
\v 31 sotheli if ony man wole ayenbie hise tithis, he schal adde the fyuethe part of tho; of alle tithis, 
\v 32 of scheep, and of oxen, and of geet, that passen vndur the `yerde of scheepherde, whateuer thing cometh to the tenthe part, it schal be halewid to the Lord; 
\v 33 it schal not be chosun, nether good, nether yuel; nethir it schal be chaungid for another; if ony man chaungith, bothe that, that is chaungid, and that, for which it is chaungid, schal be halewid to the Lord, and it schal not be ayenbouyt. 
\v 34 These ben the comaundementis whiche the Lord comaundide to Moises, and to the sones of Israel, in the hil of Synay.
