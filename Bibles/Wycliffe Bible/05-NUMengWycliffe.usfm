\v 1 And the Lord spak to Moises, and seide, Comaunde thou to the sones of Israel, 
\v 2 that thei caste out of the castels ech leprouse man, and that fletith out seed, and is defoulid on a deed bodi; caste ye out of the castels, 
\v 3 as wel a male as a female, lest thei defoulen tho, whanne thei dwellen with you. 
\v 4 And the sones of Israel diden so; and thei castiden hem out of the castels, as the Lord spak to Moises. 
\v 5 And the Lord spak to Moises, 
\v 6 and seide, Speke thou to the sones of Israel, Whanne a man ethir a womman han do of alle synnes that ben wont to falle to men, and han broke bi necgligence the `comaundement of the Lord, 
\v 7 and han trespassid, thei schulen knowleche her synne, and thei schulen yelde thilke heed, and the fyuethe part aboue, to hym ayens whom thei synneden. 
\v 8 But if noon is that schal resseyue thei schulen yyue to the Lord, and it schal be the preestis part, outakun the ram which is offrid for clensyng, that it be a quemeful sacrifice. 
\v 9 Also alle the firste fruytis, whiche the sones of Israel offren, perteynen to the preest; 
\v 10 and what euer thing \f + \fr 5:10  \ft  thing that is offrid, this is soth of the firste fruytis, not of othere sacrifices. \f* is offrid of ech man in the seyntuarie, and is youun to the `hondis of the preest,\f + \fr 5:10  \ft  and is youun to the hondis of the prest, in Ebreu it is, whiche a man halewid, and yaf to the hondis of the prest. \f* it schal be the preestis part. 
\v 11 And the Lord spak to Moises, 
\v 12 and seide, Speke thou to the sones of Israel, and thou schalt seie to hem, If `the wijf of a man hath errid, and hath dispisid the hosebonde, 
\v 13 and hath slept with another man, and the hosebonde may not take ether preue this, but the auowtrye is hid, and may not be preuyd bi witnessis, for sche is not foundun in leccherie; 
\v 14 if the spirit of gelousie stirith the housebonde ayens his wijf, which is ether defoulid, ethir is apechid bi fals suspecioun, 
\v 15 the man schal brynge hir to the preest, and he schal offre an offryng for hir `the tenthe part of a mesure clepid satum of barli meele; he schal not schede oyle ther onne, nethir he schal putte encense, for it is the sacrifice of gelousie, and an offryng enquerynge auowtrye. 
\v 16 Therfor the preest schal offre hir, and schal sette bifore the Lord; 
\v 17 and he schal take holi watir in `a vessel of erthe, and he schal putte in to it a litil of the erthe of the pawment of the tabernacle. 
\v 18 And whanne the womman stondith in the siyt of the Lord, he schal diskyuere hir heed, and he schal putte `on the hondis of hir the sacrifice of remembryng, and the offryng of gelousie. Sotheli he schal holde moost bittir watris, in whiche he gaderide togidere cursis with cursyng. 
\v 19 And he schal conioure hir, and schal seie, If an alien man slepte not with thee, and if thou art not defoulid in the forsakyng the bed of the hosebonde, these bittereste watris schulen not anoye thee, in to whiche Y haue gaderid togidere cursis; 
\v 20 ellis if thou bowidst awei fro thin hosebonde, and art defoulid, and hast leyn with another man, 
\v 21 thou schalt be suget to these cursyngys; the Lord yyue thee in to cursyng, and in to ensaumple of alle men in his puple; `the Lord make thin hipe to wexe rotun, and thi wombe swelle, and be brokun; 
\v 22 cursid watris entre in to thi wombe, and while the wombe swellith, thin hipe wexe rotun. And the womman schal answere, Amen! amen! 
\v 23 And the preest schal write thes cursis in a litil book, and he schal do awey tho cursis with bittereste watris, in to whiche he gaderide cursis, 
\v 24 and he schal yyue to hir to drynke. And whanne sche hath drunke tho watris, 
\v 25 the preest schal take of hir hond the sacrifice of gelousie, and he schal reise it bifor the Lord, and he schal putte on the auter; 
\v 26 so oneli that he take bifore an handful of sacrifice `of that that is offrid, and brenne on the auter, and so yyue drynke to the womman the moost bittere watris. 
\v 27 And whanne sche hath drunke tho watris, if sche is defoulid, and is gilti of auowtrie, for the hosebonde is dispisid, the watris of cursyng schulen passe thorouy hir, and while the wombe is bolnyd, the hipe schal wexe rotun, and the womman schal be in to cursyng and in to ensaumple to al the puple. 
\v 28 That if sche is not pollutid, sche schal be harmeles, and schal brynge forth fre children. 
\v 29 This is the lawe of gelousie, if a womman bowith awei fro hir hosebonde, and is defoulid, 
\v 30 and the hosebonde is stirid with the spirit of gelousye, and bryngith hir in to the `siyt of the Lord, and the preest doith to hir bi alle thingis that ben writun, the hosebonde schal be with out synne, 
\v 31 and sche schal resseyue hir wickidnesse.

\p
\v 1 And the Lord spak to Moises and seide, Speke thou to the sones of Israel, 
\v 2 and thou schalt seie to hem, Whanne a man ether a womman makith auow, that thei be halewid, and thei wolen halewe hem silf to the Lord, 
\v 3 thei schulen absteyne fro wyn and fro al thing that may make drunkun; thei schulen not drynke vynegre of wyn, and of ony other drynkyng,\f + \fr 6:3  \ft  In Ebreu it is, of ony thing able to make drunkun. \f* and what euer thing is pressid out of the grape; thei schulen not ete freisch grapis and drie,

\v 5 In al tyme of his departyng a rasour schal not passe on his heed, `til to the day fillid in which he is halewid to the Lord; he schal be hooli while the heer of his heed `schal wexe. 
\v 6 In al the tyme of his halewing he schal not entre on a deed bodi,\f + \fr 6:6  \ft  that is, he shal not consente to hem that ben deed by sinne. \f* 
\v 7 and sotheli he schal not be defoulid on the deed bodi of fadir and of moder, of brothir and of sistir, for the halewyng of his God is on his heed; 
\v 8 ech dai of his departyng schal be hooli to the Lord. 
\v 9 But if ony man is deed sudeynly bifore hym, the heed of his halewyng schal be defoulid, which he schal schaue anoon in the same dai of his clensyng, and eft in the seuenthe dai; 
\v 10 forsothe in the eiyte dai he schal offre twei turtlis, ether twei `briddis of a culuer, to the preest, in the entryng of the boond of pees of witnessyng. 
\v 11 And the preest schal make oon for synne, and the tothir in to brent sacrifice; and the preest schal preie for hym, for he synnede on a deed bodi, and he schal halewe his heed in that dai. 
\v 12 And he schal halewe to the Lord the daies of his departyng, and he schal offre a lomb of o yeer for synne, so netheles that the formere daies be maad voide, for his halewyng is defoulid. 
\v 13 This is the lawe of consecracioun. Whanne the daies schulen be fillid, whiche he determynede by a vow, the preest schal brynge hym to the dore of the tabernacle of boond of pees, and schal offre his offryng to the Lord, 
\v 14 a lomb of o yeer with out wem, in to brent sacrifice, and a scheep of o yeer with outen wem, for synne, and a ram with out wem, a pesible sacrifice; 
\v 15 also a panyere of theerf looues, that ben spreynt togidere with oile, and cakis sodun in watir, and aftir anoyntid with oile, with out sourdow, and fletyng sacrifices of alle bi hem silf; 
\v 16 whiche the preest schal offre bifor the Lord, and schal make as wel for synne as in to brent sacrifice. 
\v 17 Sotheli he schal offre the ram a pesible sacrifice to the Lord, and he schal offre togidere a panyere of therf looues and fletyng sacryfices, that ben due bi custom. 
\v 18 Thanne the Nazarei schal be schauun fro the heer of his consecracioun, bifor the doore of the tabernacle of boond of pees; and the preest schal take hise heeris, and schal putte on the fier, which is put vndur the sacrifice of pesible thingis. 
\v 19 And he schal take the schuldur sodun of the ram, and o `cake of breed with out sourdow fro the panyere, and o theerf caak first sodun in watir and aftirward fried in oile, and he schal bitake in the hondis of the Nazarei, aftir that his heed is schauun. 
\v 20 And the preest schal reise in the `siyt of the Lord the thingis takun eft of hym. And the thingis halewid schulen be the preestis part, as the brest which is comaundid to be departid, and the hipe. Aftir these thingis the Nasarey may drynke wyn. 
\v 21 This is the lawe of the Nasarei, whanne he hath avowyd his offryng to the Lord in the tyme of his consecracioun, outakun these thingis whiche his hond fyndith.\f + \fr 6:21  \ft  or his power mai strecche to. \f* By this that he avowide in soule, so he schal do, to the perfeccioun of his halewyng. 
\v 22 And the Lord spak to Moyses and seide,

\v 24 The Lord blesse thee, and kepe thee; 
\v 25 the Lord schewe his face to thee, and haue mercy on thee;

\v 7 and thou schalt clense hem bi this custom. Be thei spreynt with watir of clensyng, and schaue thei alle the heeris of her fleisch. And whanne thei han waische her clothis and ben clensid, take thei an oxe of drooues, 
\v 8 and the fletyng sacrifice therof, flour spreynt to gidere with oile; forsothe thou schalt take another oxe of the drooue for synne; 
\v 9 and thou schalt present the Leuytis bifor the tabernacle of boond of pees, whanne al the multitude of the sones of Israel is clepid togidere. 
\v 10 And whanne the Leuytis ben bifor the Lord, the sones of Israel schulen sette her hondis on hem; 
\v 11 and Aaron schal offre the Leuytis in the siyt of the Lord, a yifte of the sones of Israel, that thei serue in the seruice `of hym. 
\v 12 Also the Leuytis schulen sette her hondis on the heedis of the oxun, of whiche oxun thou schalt make oon for synne, and the tother in to brent sacrifice of the Lord, that thou preye for hem. 
\v 13 And thou schalt ordeyne the Leuytis in the siyt of Aaron, and of hise sones, and thou schalt sacre hem offrid to the Lord; 
\v 14 and thou schalt departe hem fro the myddis of the sones of Israel, that thei be myne. 
\v 15 And aftirward entre thei in to the tabernacle of boond of pees, that thei serue me; and so thou schalt clense and schalt halewe hem, in to an offryng of the Lord, for bi fre yifte thei ben youun to me of the sones of Israel. 
\v 16 Y haue take hem for the firste gendrid thingis that openen ech wombe in Israel; 
\v 17 for alle the firste gendrid thingis of the sones of Israel ben myne, as wel of men as of beestis, fro the dai in which Y smoot ech firste gendrid thing in the loond of Egipt, Y halewide hem to me. 
\v 18 And Y took the Leuytis for alle the firste gendrid children of the sones of Israel; 
\v 19 and Y yaf hem bi fre yifte to Aaron and hise sones, fro the myddis of the puple, that thei serue me for Israel, in the tabernacle of boond of pees, and that thei preie for hem, lest veniaunce be in the puple, if thei ben hardi to neiye to the seyntuarye. 
\v 20 And Moises and Aaron, and al the multitude of the sones of Israel, diden on the Leuitis tho thingis that the Lord comaundide to Moyses. 
\v 21 And thei weren clensid, and thei waischiden her clothis; and Aaron reiside hem in the siyt of the Lord, and preiede for hem, 
\v 22 that thei schulen be clensid, and schulden entre to her offices in to the tabernacle of boond of pees, bifor Aaron and hise sones; as the Lord comaundide to Moises of the Leuytis, so it was don. 
\v 23 And the Lord spak to Moises, and seide, This is lawe of Leuytis; 
\v 24 fro fyue and twentithe yeer \f + \fr 8:24  \ft  fro xxv. yeer, for thanne thei entriden to lerne the offices, but in the xxx. yeer, they weren ordeyned mynystris, if they weren able. \f* and aboue thei schulen entre, for to mynystre in the tabernacle of boond of pees;

\v 1 And the Lord spak to Moises, in the deseert of Synay, in the secounde yeer aftir that thei yeden out of the lond of Egipt, in the firste moneth, 
\v 2 and seide, The sones of Israel make pask in his tyme, 
\v 3 in the fourtenthe day of this monethe, at the euentid, bi alle the cerymonyes and iustifiyngis therof. 
\v 4 And Moises comaundide to the sones of Israel, that thei schulden make pask; 
\v 5 whiche maden in his tyme, in the fourtenthe dai of the monethe, at euentid, in the hil of Synai; bi alle thingis whiche the Lord comaundide to Moises, the sones of Israel diden. 
\v 6 Lo! forsothe summen vncleene on the soule of man, that myyten not make pask in that dai, neiyiden to Moises and Aaron, 
\v 7 and seiden to hem, We ben vncleene `on the soule of man; whi ben we defraudid, that we moun not offre an offryng to the Lord in his tyme, among the sones of Israel? 
\v 8 To whiche Moises answeride, Stonde ye, that Y take counseil, what the Lord comaundith of you. 
\v 9 And the Lord spak to Moises, and seide, 
\v 10 Speke thou to the sones of Israel, A man of youre folk which is vncleene `on the soule, ether in the weie fer,\f + \fr 9:10  \ft  fer, in Latyn bokis it is addid, in youre folk, but this is not in Ebreu. \f* make he pask to the Lord in the secounde monethe, 
\v 11 in the fourtenthe dai of the monethe, at euentid; with therf looues and letusis of the feeld he schal ete it. 
\v 12 Thei schulen not leeue ony thing therof til the morewtid, and thei schulen not breke a boon therof; thei schulen kepe al the custom of pask. 
\v 13 Forsothe if ony man is bothe cleene, and is not in the weie, and netheles made not pask, thilke man schal be distried fro hise puplis, for he offeride not sacrifice to the Lord in his tyme; he schal bere his synne. 
\v 14 Also if a pilgrym and comelyng \f + \fr 9:14  \ft  that is, a man conuertid to the lawe of Jewis. \f* is anentis you, make he pask to the Lord, bi the cerymonyes and iustifiyngis therof; the same comaundement schal be anentis you, as wel to a comelyng as to a man borun in the loond. 
\v 15 Therfore in the dai in which the tabernacle was reisid, a cloude hilide it; sotheli as the licnesse of fier was on the tente fro euentid til the morewtid. 
\v 16 Thus it was don continueli, a cloude hilide it bi dai, and as the licnesse of fier bi nyyt. 
\v 17 And whanne the cloude that hilide the tabernacle was takun awei, thanne the sones of Israel yeden forth, and in the place where the cloude stood, there thei settiden tentis. 
\v 18 At the comaundement of the Lord thei yeden forth, and at his comaundement thei settiden the tabernacle. In alle daies in whiche the cloude stood on the tabernacle, thei dwelliden in the same place. 
\v 19 And if it bifelde that it dwellide in myche tyme on the tabernacle, the sones of Israel weren in the watchis of the Lord, and thei yeden not forth, 
\v 20 in hou many euer daies the cloude was on the tabernacle. At the comaundement of the Lord thei reisiden tentis, and at his comaundement thei diden doun. 
\v 21 If the cloude was fro euentid `til to the morewtid, and anoon in the morewtid hadde left, thei yeden forth; and if aftir a dai and nyyt it hadde go awei, thei scateriden, `ether diden doun, tentis. 
\v 22 Whether in two monethis, ether in o monethe, ether in lengere tyme, `the cloude hadde be on the tabernacle, the sones of Israel dwelliden in the same place, and yeden not forth; but anoon as it hadde go awey, thei moueden tentis. 
\v 23 Bi the word of the Lord thei settiden tentis, and bi his word thei wenten forth; and thei weren in the watchis of the Lord, bi his comaundement, bi the hond of Moyses.

\v 1 And the Lord spak to Moises, and seide,

\v 3 And whanne thou schalt sowne with trumpis, al the cumpeny schal be gaderid to thee at the dore of the tabernacle of the boond of pees. 
\v 4 If thou schalt sowne onys,\f + \fr 10:4  \ft  In Ebreu it is, in oon, that is, trumpe. \f* the princes and the heedis of the multitude of Israel schulen come to thee; 
\v 5 but if a lengere and departid trumpyng schal sowne, thei that ben at the eest coost schulen moue tentis first. 
\v 6 Forsothe in the secounde sown and lijk noise of the trumpe thei that dwellen at the south schulen reise tentis; and bi this maner othere men schulen do, whanne the trumpis schulen sowne in to goyng forth. 
\v 7 Forsothe whanne the puple schal be gederid to gidere, symple cry of trumpis schal be, and tho schulen not sowne departyngli. 
\v 8 The sones of Aaron preest schulen sowne with trumpis, and this schal be a lawful thing euerlastynge in youre generaciouns. 
\v 9 If ye schulen go out of youre lond to batel ayens enemyes that fiyten ayens you, ye schulen crye with trumpis sownynge, and the bithenkyng of you schal be bifor youre Lord God, that ye be delyuered fro the hondis of youre enemyes. 
\v 10 If ony tyme ye schulen haue a feeste, and halidaies, and calendis,\f + \fr 10:10  \ft  that is, the firste day of the monethe. \f* ye schulen synge in trumpis on brent sacrifices and pesible sacrifices, that tho be to you in to remembryng of youre God; Y am youre Lord God. 
\v 11 In the secounde yeer, in the secounde monethe, in the twentithe dai of the monethe, the cloude was reisid fro the tabernacle of boond of pees. 
\v 12 And the sones of Israel yeden forth bi her cumpenyes fro deseert of Synay; and the cloude restide in the wildirnesse of Faran.

\v 23 Forsothe in the lynage of the sones of Manasses the prince was Gamaliel, the sone of Phadussur.

\v 26 Sotheli in the lynage of the sones of Aser the prince was Phegiel, the sone of Ochran. 
\v 27 And in the lynage of the sones of Neptalym the prince was Haira, the sone of Henan. 
\v 28 These ben the castels and the goinges forth of the sones of Israel, bi her cumpenyes, whanne thei yeden out. 
\v 29 And Moises seide to Heliab, the sone of Raguel, of Madian, his alie `ethir fadir of his wijf, We goon forth to the place which the Lord schal yyue to vs; come thou with vs, that we do wel to thee, for the Lord bihiyte goode thingis to Israel. 
\v 30 To whom he answeride, Y schal not go with thee, but Y schal turne ayen in to my lond, in which Y was borun.

\v 34 And the cloude of the Lord was on hem bi day, whanne thei yeden.

\v 1 Yn the meene tyme the grutchyng of the puple, as of men sorewynge for trauel, roos ayens the Lord. And whanne Moises hadde herd this thing, he was wrooth; and the fier of the Lord was kyndelid on hem, and deuouride the laste part of the tentis. 
\v 2 And whanne the puple hadde cried to Moises, Moises preiede the Lord, and the fier was quenchid. 
\v 3 And he clepid the name of that place Brennyng, for the fier of the Lord was kyndlid ayens hem. 
\v 4 And the comyn puple of `malis and femalis, that hadde stied with hem, brent with desire \f + \fr 11:4  \ft  or coueitide lusty metis. marg. \f* of fleischis,\f + \fr 11:4  \ft  This word of fleischis is not in Ebreu, nether in bokis amendid, for thei desiriden fleischis and fischis and othere thingis; as it is seid with ynne. \f* and sat, and wepte with the sones of Israel ioyned togidere to hem, and seide, Who schal yyue to vs fleischis to ete? 
\v 5 We thenken on the fischis whiche we eten in Egipt freli; gourdis, and melouns, and lekis, and oyniouns, and garlekis comen in to mynde `to vs; 
\v 6 oure soule is drie \f + \fr 11:6  \ft  or oure mynde is wery. \f* ; oure iyen byholden noon other thing `no but manna. 
\v 7 Forsothe manna was as the seed of coriaundre, of the colour of bdellyum, which is whijt and briyt as cristal. 
\v 8 And the puple yede aboute, and gaderide it, and brak with a queerne stoon, ether pownede in a morter, and sethide in a pot; and made therof litle cakis of the sauour, as of breed maad with oile. 
\v 9 And whanne dew cam doun in the niyt on the tentis, also manna cam doun togidere. 
\v 10 Therfor Moises herde the puple wepynge bi meynees, and `alle bi hem silf bi the doris of her tentis; and the woodnesse of the Lord was wrooth greetli, but also the thing was seyn vnsuffrable to Moises. 
\v 11 And he seide to the Lord, Whi hast thou turmentid thi seruaunt? whi fynde Y not grace bifor thee? and whi hast thou put on me the burthun of al this puple? 
\v 12 whethir Y conseyuede al this multitude, ethir gendride it, that thou seie to me, Bere thou hem in thi bosum as a nurise is wont to bere a litil yong child, and bere thou in to the lond for which thou hast swore to the fadris `of hem. 
\v 13 wherof ben fleischis to me, that Y `yyue to so greet multitude? Thei wepen bifore me, and seyn, `Yyue thou fleischis to vs that we ete;

\v 15 If in other maner it semeth to thee, Y biseche that thou sle me, and that Y fynde grace in thin iyen, that Y be not punyschid bi so grete yuelis. 
\v 16 And the Lord seide to Moises, Gadere thou to me seuenti men of the eldre men of Israel, whiche thou knowist, `that thei ben the elde men and maistris of the puple; and thou schalt lede hem to the dore of the tabernacle of boond of pees, and thou schalt make to stonde there with thee,

As yif many candlis weren liytid by o candil and yit that candil hath neuer the lesse liyt. \f* and Y schal yyue to hem, that thei susteyne with thee the birthun of the puple, and not thou aloone be greuyd. 
\v 18 And thou schalt seie to the puple, Be ye halewid; to morew ye schulen ete fleischis; for Y herde you seie, Who schal yyue to vs the metis of fleischis? it was wel to vs in Egipt; that the Lord yyue `fleischis to you,

\v 23 To whom the Lord answeride, Whether the `hond of the Lord is vnmyyti? riyt now thou schalt se, wher my word schal be fillid in werk. 
\v 24 Therfor Moises cam, and telde to the puple the wordis of the Lord; and he gaderide seuenti men of the eldere of Israel, whiche he made stonde aboute the tabernacle. 
\v 25 And the Lord cam doun bi a cloude, and spak to Moises, and took a weye of the spirit that was in Moises, and yaf to the seuenti men; and whanne the spirit hadde restid in hem, thei profesieden, and ceessiden not `aftirward.

\v 28 Anoon Josue, the sone of Nun, the `mynystre of Moises, and chosun of manye, seide, My lord Moises, forbede thou hem. 
\v 29 And he seide, What hast thou enuye for me? who yyueth that al the puple profesie, and that God yyue his spirit to hem? 
\v 30 And Moises turnede ayen, and the eldre men in birthe of Israel in to the tentis. 
\v 31 Forsothe a wynde yede forth fro the Lord, and took curlewis, and bar ouer the see, and lefte in to the tentis, in the iurney, as myche as mai be parformed in o day, bi ech part of the tentis bi cumpas; and tho flowen in the eir bi twei cubitis in `hiynesse ouer the erthe.

\v 6 And whanne thei hadden go, he seide to hem, Here ye my wordis; if ony among you is a profete of the Lord, Y schal appere to hym in reuelacioun, ethir Y schal speke to hym bi `a dreem.

\v 4 And thei seiden oon to another, Ordeyne we a duyk to vs, and turne we ayen in to Egipt. 
\v 5 And whanne this was herd, Moises and Aaron felden lowe to erthe, bifor al the multitude of the sones of Israel. 
\v 6 And sotheli Josue, the sone of Nun, and Caleph, the sone of Jephone, whiche also cumpassiden the lond, to renten her clothis,

\v 11 And the Lord seide to Moises, Hou long schal this puple bacbite me? Hou longe schulen thei not bileue to me in alle `signes, whiche Y haue do bifor hem?

\v 28 Therfor seie thou to hem, Y lyue, seith the Lord; as ye spaken while Y herde, so Y schal do to you;

\v 6 Bi ech loomb and ram schal be the sacrifice of flour, of twey tenthe partis, which schal be spreynt togidere with oile, of the thridde part of hyn;

\v 25 And the preest schal preie for al the multitude of the sones of Israel, and it schal be foryouun to hem, for thei synneden not wilfuli. And neuerthelesse thei schulen offre encense to the Lord for hemsilf, and for her synne and errour; 
\v 26 and it schal be foryouun to al the puple of the sones of Israel, and to comelyngis that ben pilgryms among hem, for it is the synne of al the multitude bi ignoraunce. 
\v 27 That if a soule synneth vnwityngli, it schal offre a geet of o yeer for his synne; and the preest schal preye for that soule, for it synnede vnwityngli bifor the Lord;

\v 29 As wel to men borun in the lond as to comelyngis, o lawe schal be of alle that synnen vnwityngli. 
\v 30 Forsothe a man that doith ony synne bi pride, schal perische fro his puple, whether he be a citeseyn, ethir a pilgrym, for he was rebel ayens the Lord; 
\v 31 for he dispiside the word of the Lord, and made voide his comaundement; therfor he schal be doon awei, and schal bere his owne wickidnes. 
\v 32 Forsothe it was doon, whanne the sones of Israel weren in wildirnesse, and hadde founde a man gaderynge woode in the `day of sabat,

\v 1 Lo! forsothe Chore, the sone of Isuar, sone of Caath, sone of Leuy, and Dathan and Abiron, the sones of Heliab, and Hon, the sone of Pheleph, of the sones of Ruben, rysen ayens Moises, 
\v 2 and othere of the sones of Israel, two hundryd men and fifti, prynces of the synagoge, and whiche weren clepid bi names in the tyme of counsel. 
\v 3 And whanne `thei hadden stonde ayens Moises and Aaron, thei seiden, Suffice it to you, for al the multitude is of hooly men, and the Lord is in hem; whi ben ye reisid on the puple of the Lord?

\v 5 And he spak to Chore, and to al the multitude; he seide, Eerli the Lord schal make knowun whiche perteynen to hym, and he schal applie to hym hooli men; and thei whiche he hath chose, schulen neiye to hym. 
\v 6 Therfor do ye this thing; ech man take his cencere, thou Chore, and al thi counsel;

\v 9 Whether it is litil to you, that God of Israel departide you fro al the puple, and ioynede you to hym silf, that ye schulden serue hym in the seruyce of tabernacle, and that ye schulden stonde bifor the multitude of puple, and schulden serue hym? 
\v 10 Made he therfor thee and alle thi bretheren the sones of Leuy to neiy to hym silf, that ye chalenge to you also preesthod, 
\v 11 and al thi gaderyng togidere stonde ayens the Lord? For whi what is Aaron, that ye grutchen ayens hym? 
\v 12 Therfor Moises sente to clepe Dathan and Abiron, the sones of Heliab; whiche answeriden, We comen not. 
\v 13 Whethir is it litil to thee, that thou leddist vs out of the lond that flowide with mylk and hony, to sle vs in the deseert, no but also thou be lord of vs? 
\v 14 Verili \f + \fr 16:14  \ft  Thei seiden this in scorn, to signefie that Moises disseyuede the puple bi false bihestis.

\v 15 We comen not. And Moises was wrooth greetli, and seide to the Lord, Biholde thou not the sacrifices of hem; thou wost that Y took neuere of hem, yhe, a litil asse, nethir Y turmentide ony of hem. 
\v 16 And Moises seide to Chore, Thou and al thi congregacioun stonde asidis half bifor the Lord, and Aaron to morewe bi hym silf. 
\v 17 Take ye alle bi you silf youre censeris, and putte ye encense in tho, and offre ye to the Lord, tweyn hundrid and fifti censeris; and Aaron holde his censer. 
\v 18 And whanne thei hadden do this, while Moises and Aaron stoden, 
\v 19 and thei hadden gaderid al the multitude to the `dore of the tabernacle ayens hem, the glorie of the Lord apperide to alle. 
\v 20 And the Lord spak to Moises and Aaron, 
\v 21 and seide, Be ye departid fro the myddis of this congregacioun, that Y leese hem sodeynli. 
\v 22 Whiche felden lowe on the face, and seiden, Strongeste God of the spiritis of al fleisch, whethir `thin yre schal be fers ayens alle men, for o man synneth? 
\v 23 And the Lord seide to Moises, 
\v 24 Comaunde thou to al the puple, that it be departid fro the tabernaclis of Chore, and of Dathan, and of Abiron. 
\v 25 And Moises roos, and yede to Dathan and Abiron; and while the eldre men of Israel sueden hym, 
\v 26 he seide to the cumpeny, Go ye awey fro the tabernaclis of wickid men, and nyle ye touche tho thingis that parteynen to hem, lest ye ben wlappid in the synnes of hem. 
\v 27 And whanne thei hadden gon awei fro the tentis `of hem bi the cumpas, Dathan and Abiron yeden out, and stoden in the entryng of her tentis, with wyues, and fre children, and al the multitude. 
\v 28 And Moises seide, In this ye schulen wite that the Lord sente me, that Y schulde do alle thingis whiche ye seen, and Y brouyte not forth tho of myn owne herte. 
\v 29 If thei perischen bi customable deeth of men, and wounde visite hem, bi which also othere men ben wont to be visitid, 
\v 30 the Lord sente not me; but if the Lord doith a newe thing, that the erthe opene his mouth, and swolewe hem, and alle thingis that perteynen to hem, and thei goen doun quyke in to helle, ye schulen wite that thei blasfemeden the Lord. 
\v 31 Therfor anoon as he cesside to speke, the erthe was brokun vndur her feet, 
\v 32 and the erthe openyde his mouth, and deuowride hem, with her tabernaclis, and al the catel `of hem; 
\v 33 and thei yeden doun quike in to helle, and weren hilid with erthe, and perischiden fro the myddis of the multitude. 
\v 34 And sotheli al Israel that stood bi the cumpas, fledde fro the cry of men perischinge, and seide, Lest perauenture the erthe swolewe also vs. 
\v 35 But also fier yede out fro the Lord, and killide tweyn hundrid and fifti men that offriden encense. 
\v 36 And the Lord spak to Moises, and seide, 
\v 37 Comaunde thou to Eleasar, sone of Aaron, preest, that he take the censeris that liggen in the brennyng, and that he schatere the fier hidur and thidur; for tho ben halewid in the dethis of synneris; 
\v 38 and that he bringe forth tho in to platis, and naile to the auter, for encense is offrid in tho to the Lord, and tho ben halewid, that the sonis of Israel se tho for a signe and memorial. 
\v 39 Therfor Eleazar, preest, took the brasun senseris, in whiche censeris thei whiche the brennyng deuouride hadden offrid, and he `brouyt forth tho in to platis, and nailide to the auter; 
\v 40 that the sones of Israel schulden haue thingis aftirward, bi whiche thei schulden remembre, lest ony alien, and which is not of the seed of Aaron, neiy to offre encense to the Lord, lest he suffre, as Chore sufferide, and al his multitude, while the Lord spak to Moises. 
\v 41 Forsothe al the multitude of the sones of Israel grutchide in the dai suynge ayens Moises and Aaron, and seide, Ye han slayn the puple of the Lord. 
\v 42 And whanne discensioun roos, 
\v 43 and noise encresside, Moises and Aaron fledden to the tabernacle of the boond of pees; and aftir that thei entriden in to it, a cloude hilide the tabernacle, and the glorie of the Lord apperide. 
\v 44 And the Lord seide to Moises and to Aaron, 
\v 45 Go ye awey fro the myddis of this multitude, also now Y schal do awey hem. And whanne thei laien in the erthe, Moises seide to Aaron, 
\v 46 Take the censer, and whanne fyer is takun vp of the auter, caste encense aboue, and go soone to the puple, that thou preye for hem; for now ire is gon out fro the Lord, and the wounde is feers. 
\v 47 And whanne Aaron hadde do this, and hadde runne to the myddis of the multitude, which the brennynge wastid thanne, he offeride encense; 
\v 48 and he stood bytwixe the deed men and lyuynge, and bisouyte for the puple, and the wounde ceesside. 
\v 49 Sotheli thei that weren smytun weren fourtene thousynde of men and seuene hundrid, with outen hem that perischiden in the discencioun of Chore.

\v 6 And Moyses spak to the sones of Israel; and alle princes yauen to hym yerdis, bi alle lynagis; and the yerdis weren twelue, without the yerde of Aaron. 
\v 7 And whanne Moises hadde put tho yerdis bifor the Lord, in the tabernacle of witnessyng, he yede ayen in the day suynge, 
\v 8 and founde that the yerde of Aaron, `in the hows of Leuy, buriounnede; and whanne knoppis weren greet, the blossoms `hadden broke out, whiche weren alargid in leeuys, and weren fourmed in to alemaundis.

\v 13 Ech that touchith the deed bodi bi it silf of mannus soule, and is not spreynt with this medlyng, defoulith the `tabernacle of the Lord, and he schal perische fro Israel; for he is not spreynt with the wateris of clensyng, he schal be vncleene, and his filthe schal dwelle on hym. 
\v 14 This is the lawe of a man that dieth in the tabernacle; alle that entren in to his tente, and alle vessels that ben there, schulen be defoulid bi seuene daies.

\v 5 Whi han ye maad vs to stie from Egipt, and han brouyt vs in to this werste place, which may not be sowun, which nether bryngith forth fige tre, nether vineris, nether pumgranatis, ferthermore and hath not watir to drynke? 
\v 6 And whanne the multitude was left, Moises and Aaron entriden in to the tabernacle of boond of pees, and felden lowe to erthe, and crieden to God, and seiden, Lord God, here the cry of this puple, and opene to hem thi tresour, a welle of quyk watir, that whanne thei ben fillid, the grutchyng of hem ceesse. And the glorie of the Lord apperide on hem;

\v 9 Therfor Moises took the yerde that was in the `siyt of the Lord, as the Lord comaundide to hym, 
\v 10 whanne the multitude was gaderid bifor the stoon; and he seide to hem, Here ye, rebel and vnbileueful; whether we moun brynge out of this stoon watir to you? 
\v 11 And whanne Moises hadde reisid the hond, and hadde smyte the flynt twies with the yerde, largeste watris yeden out, so that the puple drank, and the beestis drunken.

\v 13 This is the watir of ayenseiyng; there the sones of Israel stryueden ayens the Lord, and he was halewid in hem. 
\v 14 In the meene tyme Moises sente messangeres fro Cades to the kyng of Edom, whiche seiden, Israel thi brother sendith these thinges. Thou knowist al the trauel that took vs,

\v 16 and he herde vs, and sente an aungel that ledde vs out of Egipt. And lo! we ben set in the citee of Cades, which is in thi laste coostis, 
\v 17 and we bisechen that it be leueful to vs to passe thorou thi lond; we schulen not go bi feeldis, nether bi vyneris, nether we schulen drynke watris of thi pittis; but we schulen go in the comyn weie, and we schulen not bowe to the riyt side, nether to the left side, til we passen thi termes. 
\v 18 To whom Edom answeride, Ye schulen not passe bi me, ellis Y schal be armed, and come ayens thee. 
\v 19 And the sones of Israel seiden, We schulen go bi the weie comynli vsid, and if we and oure beestis drynken thi watris, we schulen yyue that that is iust; noon hardnesse schal be in prijs, onely passe we swiftli. 
\v 20 And he answeride, Ye schulen not passe. And anoon he yede out ayens Israel, with a multitude without noumbre, and `strong hond,

\v 23 where the Lord spak to Moyses and seide, Aaron go to his puples; 
\v 24 for he schal not entre in to the lond which Y yaf to the sones of Israel, for he was vnbileueful to my mouth, at the watris of ayenseiyng.

\v 2 And Israel bounde hym sylf bi avow to the Lord, and seide, If thou schalt bitake this puple in myn hond, Y schal do awei `the citees therof.

\v 26 The citee of Esebon was Seons, kyng of Ammorei, which Seon fauyt ayens the kyng of Moab, and took al the lond that was of his lordschip, `til to Arnon.

\v 12 And God seide to Balaam, Nyle thou go with hem, nether curse thou the puple, for it is blessid. 
\v 13 Which Balaam roos eerli, and seide to the princes, Go ye in to youre lond, for God forbeed me to come with you. 
\v 14 The princes turneden ayen, and seiden to Balaach, Balaam nolde come with vs. 
\v 15 Eft Balaach sente many mo and noblere men, than he hadde sent bifore;

\v 19 Y biseche, that ye dwelle here also in this nyyt, that Y may wite what the Lord schal answere eft to me. 
\v 20 Therfor the Lord cam to Balaam in the nyyt, and seide to hym, If these men comen to clepe thee, rise thou, and go with hem, so oneli that thou do that that Y schal comaunde to thee. 
\v 21 Balaam roos eerli, and whanne his femal asse was sadelid, he yede forth with hem. 
\v 22 And God was wrooth. And the `aungel of the Lord stood in the weie ayens Balam, that sat on the femal asse, and hadde twei children with hym. 
\v 23 The femal asse siy the aungel stondynge in the weie, with swerd drawun, and `turnede a wei hir silf fro the weie, and yede bi the feeld. And whanne Balaam beet hir, and wolde lede ayen to the path, 
\v 24 the aungel stood in the streitnessis of twei wallis, with whiche the vyneris weren cumpassid. 
\v 25 And the femal asse siy the aungel, and ioynede hir silf to the wal, and hurtlide the foot of the sittere; and he beet eft `the asse. 
\v 26 And neuer the lesse the aungel yede to the streit place, where me `myyte not go out of the weie, nether to the riyt side nether to the left side, and stood ayens hym. 
\v 27 And whanne the femal asse siy the aungel stondynge, sche felde doun vndir the feet of the sittere, which was wrooth ful greetli, and beet hir sidis with a staaf. 
\v 28 And the Lord openyde the `mouth of the femal asse, and sche spak, What have Y doon to thee? whi smytist thou me, lo! now the thridde tyme? 
\v 29 Balaam answeride, For thou hast disserued, and hast scornyd me; Y wolde that Y hadde a swerd to sle thee. 
\v 30 And the femal asse seide, Whether Y am not thi beeste on which thou were wont to sitte euere til in to this present dai? seie thou, what lijk thing Y dide euere to thee? And he seide, Neuere. 
\v 31 Anoon the Lord openyde `the iyen of Balaam, and he siy the aungel stondynge in the weie, holdynge a drawun swerd in the hoond; and Balaam worschipide hym lowli in to erthe. 
\v 32 To whom the aungel seide, Whi `betist thou thi femal asse `the thridde tyme? Y cam to be aduersarie to thee, for thi weie is weiward, and contrarye to me; 
\v 33 and if the femal asse hadde not bowid a wey fro the weie, and youe place to ayenstondere, Y hadde slayn thee, and sche schulde lyue. 
\v 34 Balaam seide, Y synnede, not witynge that thou stodist ayens me; and now, if it displesith thee that Y go, Y schal turne ayen. 
\v 35 The aungel seide, Go thou with these men, but be war that thou speke not other thing than Y schal comaunde to thee. Therfor Balaam yede with the princes. 
\v 36 And whanne Balaach hadde herde this, he yede out in to the comyng of hym, in the citee of Moabitis, whiche is set in the laste coostis of Arnon. 
\v 37 And he seide to Balaam, Y sente messangeris to clepe thee; whi camest thou not anoon to me? whethir for Y may not yelde meede to thi comyng? 
\v 38 To whom Balaam answeride, Lo! Y am present, whethir Y schal mow speke other thing than that, that God schal putte in my mouth? 
\v 39 Therfor thei yeden forth to gidere, and camen in to a citee, which was in the laste coost of `his rewme. 
\v 40 And whanne Balaach hadde slayn scheep and oxun, he sente yiftis to Balaam and the princes that weren with hym. 
\v 41 Forsothe whanne the morewtid was maad, Balaach ledde Balaam to the hiye placis of Baal, and he bihelde the laste part of the puple, `that is, al the oost til to the laste part. 
\c 23  
\p
\v 1 And Balaam seide to Balaach, Bilde thou here to me seuene auteris, and make redi so many caluys, and rammes of the same noumbre. 
\v 2 And whanne he hadde do bi the word of Balaam, thei puttiden a calf and a ram to gidere on the auter. 
\v 3 And Balaam seide to Balaach, Stond thou a litil while bisidis thi brent sacrifice, while Y go, if in hap the Lord meete me; and Y schal `speke to thee what euer thing he schal comaunde. 
\v 4 And whanne he hadde go swiftli, God cam to hym; and Balaam spak to hym, and seide, Y reiside seuene auteris, and Y puttide a calf and a ram aboue. 
\v 5 Forsothe the Lord `puttide a word in his mouth, and seide, Turne ayen to Balaach, and thou schalt speke these thingis. 
\v 6 He turnede ayen, and fond Balach stondynge bisidis his brent sacrifice, and alle the princes of Moabitis. 
\v 7 And whanne his parable `was takun, he seide, Balaach, the kyng of Moabitis, brouyte me fro Aran, fro the `hillis of the eest; and he seide, Come thou and curse Jacob; haaste thou, and greetli curse thou Israel. 
\v 8 How schal Y curse whom God cursid not? bi what resoun schal Y `haue abhomynable whom God `hath not abhomynable? 
\v 9 Fro the hiyeste flyntis Y schal se hym, and fro litle hillis Y schal biholde hym; the puple schal dwelle aloone, and it schal not be arettid among hethene men. 
\v 10 Who may noumbre the dust, that is, kynrede, of Jacob, and knowe the noumbre of the generacioun of Israel? My lijf die in the deeth of iust men, and my laste thingis be maad lijk hem! 
\v 11 And Balaach seide to Balaam, What is this that thou doist? Y clepide thee, that thou schuldist curse myn enemyes, and ayenward thou blessist hem. 
\v 12 To whom Balaam answeride, Whether Y may speke othir thing no but that that the Lord comaundith? 
\v 13 Therfor Balaach seide to Balaam, Come with me in to anothir place, fro whennus thou se a part of Israel, and mayst not se al; fro thennus curse thou hym. 
\v 14 And whanne he hadde led Balaam in to an hiy place, on the cop of the hil of Phasga, he bildide seuene auteris to Balaam, and whanne calues and rammes weren put aboue, 
\v 15 he seide to Balaach, Stonde here bisidis thi brent sacrifice, while Y go. 
\v 16 And whanne the Lord hadde `come to him, and hadde put `a word in his mouth, he seide, Turne ayen to Balach, and thou schalt seie these thingis to hym. 
\v 17 He turnyde ayen, and foond Balach stondynge bisidis his brent sacrifice, and the princis of Moabitis with hym. To whom Balach seide, What spak the Lord? 
\v 18 And whanne his parable `was takun, he seide, Stonde, Balach, and herkene; here, thou sone of Sephor. God is not `as a man, 
\v 19 that he lye, nethir he is as the sone of a man, that he be chaungid; therfor he seide, and schal he not do? he spak, and schal he not fulfille? 
\v 20 Y am brouyt to blesse, Y may not forbede blessyng. 
\v 21 Noon idol is in Jacob, nethir symylacre is seyn in Israel; his Lord God is with hym, and the sown of victorie of kyng is in hym. 
\v 22 The Lord God ledde hym out of Egipt, whos strengthe is lijk an vnicorn; 
\v 23 fals tellyng bi chiteryng of bryddis, `ethir idolatrie, is not in Jacob, nethir fals dyuynyng is in Israel. In his tymes it schal be seide to Jacob and Israel, What the Lord hath wrought! 
\v 24 Lo! the puple schal rise to gidere as a lionesse, and schal be reisid as a lioun; the lioun schal not reste, til he deuoure prey, and drynke the blood of hem that ben slayn. 
\v 25 And Balach seide to Balaam, Nether curse thou, nether blesse thou hym. 
\v 26 And he seide, Whether Y seide not to thee, that what euer thing that God comaundide to me, Y wolde do this? 
\v 27 And Balach seide to hym, Come, and Y schal lede thee to an other place, if in hap it plesith God that fro thennus thou curse hym. 
\v 28 And whanne Balaach hadde led hym out on the `cop of the hil of Phegor, that biholdith the wildirnesse, 
\v 29 Balaam seide to hym, Bilde here seuene auteris to me, and make redi so many caluys, and rammes of the same noumbre. 
\v 30 Balaach dide as Balaam seide, and he puttide caluys and rammes, bi alle auteris. 
\c 24  
\p
\v 1 And whanne Balaam siy that it pleside the Lord that he schulde blesse Israel, he yede not as he `hadde go bifore, `that he schulde seke fals dyuynyng `bi chiteryng of briddis, but he dresside his face ayens the desert, 
\v 2 and reiside iyen, and siy Israel dwellynge in tentis bi hise lynagis. And whanne the Spirit of God felde on hym, and whanne a parable was takun, 
\v 3 he seide, Balaam, the sone of Beor, seide, a man whois iye is stoppid seide, 
\v 4 the herere of Goddis wordis seide, which bihelde the reuelacioun of almyyti God, which fallith doun, and hise iyen ben openyd so, Hou faire ben thi tabernaclis, 
\v 5 Jacob, and thi tentis, Israel! 
\v 6 as valeys ful of woodis, and moiste gardyns bisidis floodis, as tabernaclis whiche the Lord hath set, as cedris bisidis watris; 
\v 7 watir schal flowe of his bokat, and his seed schal be in to many watris, `that is, puplis. The kyng of hym schal be takun a wei for Agag, and the rewme of hym schal be doon awai. 
\v 8 God ledde hym out of Egipt, whos strengthe is lijk an vnicorn; thei schulen deuoure \f + \fr 24:8  \ft  thei schulen deuoure etc. In Ebreu it is thus, Israel schal deuoure hethen men hise enemyes, and schal gnawe the bonys of hem, that is, schal distrie the strengthe of hem. \f* hethene men, enemyes `of hym, that is, of Israel; and thei schulen breke the boonus of hem, and schulen perse with arowis. 
\v 9 He restide and slepte as a lyoun, and as a lionesse, whom no man schal dore reise. He that blessith thee, schal be blessid; he that cursith, schal 
\v 10 be arettid in to cursyng And Balaach was wrooth ayens Balaam, and seide, whanne the hondis weren wrungun to gidere, I clepide thee to curse myn enemyes, whiche ayenward thou hast blessid thries. 
\v 11 Turne ayen to thi place; forsothe Y demede to onoure thee greetli, but the Lord priuyde thee fro onour disposid. 
\v 12 Balaam answeride to Balaach, Whethir Y seide not to thi messangeris, whiche thou sentist to me, 
\v 13 Thouy Balaach schal yyue to me his hows ful of siluer and of gold, Y schal not mow passe the word of my Lord God, that Y brynge forth of myn herte ony thing, ethir of good ethir of yuel, but what euer thing the Lord schal seie, Y schal speke this? 
\v 14 Netheles Y schal go to my puple, and Y schal yyue counsel to thee, what thi puple schal do in the laste tyme to this puple. 
\v 15 Therfor whanne a parable was takun, he seide eft, Balaam, the sone of Beor seide, a man whos iye is stoppid, 
\v 16 seide, the herere of Goddis wordis seide, which knowith the doctrine of the hiyeste, and seeth the reuelacioun of almiyti God, which fallith doun and hath opyn iyen, 
\v 17 Y schal se hym, but not now; Y schal biholde hym, but not nyy; a sterre schal be borun of Jacob, and a yerde schal rise of Israel; and he schal smyte the duykis of Moab, and he schal waste alle the sones of Seth; and Ydumye schal be hys possessioun, 
\v 18 the eritage of Seir schal bifalle to his enemyes; forsothe Israel schal do strongli, of Jacob schal be he that schal be lord, 
\v 19 and schal leese the relikis of the citee. 
\v 20 And whanne he hadde seyn Amalech, he took a parable, and seide, Amalech is the bigynning \f + \fr 24:20  \ft  Amalech is the bigynnyng, that is, he roos first ayenus Israel aftir the goyng out of Egipt. \f* of hethene men, whos laste thingis schulen be lost. 
\v 21 Also `he siy Cyney, and whanne a parable was takun, he seide, Forsothe thi dwellyng place is strong, but if thou schalt sette thi nest in a stoon, 
\v 22 and schalt be chosun of the generacioun of Cyn, hou longe schalt thou mow dwelle? forsothe Assur schal take thee. 
\v 23 And whanne a parable was takun, he spak eft, Alas! who schal lyue, whanne the Lord schal make thes thingis? 
\v 24 Thei schulen come in grete schippis fro Ytalie, thei schulen ouercome Assiries, and thei schulen distrie Ebrews, and at the last also thei hem silf schulen perische. 
\v 25 And Balaam roos, and turnide ayen in to his place; and Balaach yede ayen bi the weye in which he cam. 
\c 25  
\p
\v 1 Forsothe in that tyme Israel dwellide in Sechym; and the puple dide fornycacioun with the douytris of Moab; 
\v 2 whiche douytris clepiden hem to her sacrifices, and thei eten, and worschipiden the goddis of tho douytris; 
\v 3 and Israel made sacrifice to Belphegor. And the Lord was wrooth, 
\v 4 and seide to Moises, Take thou alle the princes of the puple, and hange hem ayens the sunne in iebatis, that my wodnesse, `that is stronge veniaunce, be turned awai fro Israel. 
\v 5 And Moises seide to the iugis of Israel, Ech man sle his neiyboris, that maden sacrifice to Belphagor. 
\v 6 And, lo! oon of the sones of Israel entride bifor his britheren to `an hoore of Madian, in the siyt of Moises, and al the cumpeny of the sones of Israel, whiche wepten bifor the yatis of the tabernacle. 
\v 7 And whanne Phynees, the sone of Eleazar, sone of Aaron, preest, hadde seyn this, he roos fro the myddis of the multitude; and whanne he hadde take a swerd, 
\v 8 he entride aftir the man of Israel in to the `hoore hows, and stikide thorou both togidere, that is, the man and the womman, in the places of gendryng. And the veniaunce ceesside fro the sones of Israel, 
\v 9 and foure and twenti thousand of men weren slayn. 
\v 10 And the Lord seide to Moises, 
\v 11 Fynees, the sone of Eleazar, sone of Aaron, preest, turnede away myn yre fro the sones of Israel; for he was stirid ayens hem bi my feruent loue, that Y my silf schulde not do awai the sones of Israel in my greet hete, `ether strong veniaunce. 
\v 12 Therfor speke thou to hym, Lo! Y yyue to hym the pees of my couenaunt,\f + \fr 25:12  \ft  couenaunt, that is, the dignete of presthod aftir his fadir. \f* 
\v 13 and it schal be an euerlastynge couenaunt of preesthod, as wel to hym silf as to his seed; for he louyde feruentli for his God, and he clenside the greet trespas of the sones of Israel. 
\v 14 Forsothe the name of the man of Israel, that was slayn with the womman of Madian, was Zambri, the sone of Salu, duyk of the kynrede and lynage of Symeon. 
\v 15 Forsothe the womman of Madian that was slayn togidere, was clepid Cobri, the douyter of Sur, the nobleste prince of Madianytis. 
\v 16 And the Lord spak to Moises and seide, 
\v 17 `Madianytis feele you enemyes, and smyte ye hem; 
\v 18 for also thei diden enemyliche ayens you, and disseyueden thorow tresouns, bi the idol of Phegor, and bi `the douyter of Corbri, duyk of Madian, her sister, which douyter was sleyn in the dai of veniaunce, for the sacrilege of Phegor.

\v 1 Aftir that the blood of gilti men was sched out, the Lord seide to Moises and to Eleasar,

\v 3 And so Moises and Eleasar, preest, spaken in the feeldi places of Moab, ouer Jordan, ayens Jerico, to hem that weren of twenti yeer and aboue,

\v 3 ethir byndith hym silf bi an ooth, he schal not make voide his word, but he schal fille al thing which he bihiyte. 
\v 4 If a womman which is in the hows of hir fadir, and is yit in the age of a damysel, `that is, not yit weddid, avowith ony thing, ethir byndith hir silf bi an ooth, `if the fadir knowith the avow, which sche bihiyte, and the ooth bi which sche boond hir soule, and he is stille, sche schal be gilti of the ooth, that is, boundun bi the ooth;

\v 16 whether it be not these that disseyueden the sones of Israel, at the suggestioun of Balaam, and maden you to do trespas ayens the Lord, on the synne of Phegor, wherfor also the puple was slayn?

\v 22 and al the lond be maad suget to hym; thanne ye schulen be giltles anentis God, and anentis Israel, and ye schulen holde the cuntreys, whiche ye wolen, bifor the Lord. 
\v 23 But if ye doon not that, that ye seien, it is not doute to ony man, that ne ye synnen ayens God; and wite ye, that youre synne schal take you. 
\v 24 Therfor bilde ye citees to youre litle children, and foldis and stablis to scheep, and to beestis; and fille ye that, that ye bihiyten.

\v 6 Forsothe the west coost schal bigynne at the greet see, and schal be closid bi that ende. 
\v 7 Sotheli at the north coost, the termes schulen bigynne at the greet see, and schulen come `til to the hiyeste hil,\f + \fr 34:7  \ft  the hiyeste hil. In Ebreu it is, til to the hil of hil. \f*

\v 3 citees to dwelle,\f + \fr 35:3  \ft  citees to dwelle, he seith not to be lord, ether to resseyue rentis there, for the citees in whiche the dekenes dwelliden, weren so the kyngis, ether of othere lordis; wherfor and Ebron was oon of tho citees, as it is ha in xx. co. of Josue; and ne theles Caleph was lord therof for it was youun to him in to possessioun, as it is had in xv. co. of Josue. \f* and the suburbabis of tho bi cumpas, that thei dwelle in `the citees, and the suburbabis be to beestis, and `werk beestis; 
\v 4 whiche suburbabis schulen be strecchid forth fro the wallis of citees with outforth `bi cumpas, in the space of a thousynde paacis;

And the citees schulen be in the myddis, and the suburbabis with outforth. 
\v 6 Forsothe of tho citees whiche ye schulen yyue to dekenes, sixe schulen be departid in to helpis of fugityues, `ether of fleynge men, that he that schedde blood, fle to tho; and outakun these sixe, ye schulen yyue to dekenes othere two and fourti citees, 
\v 7 that is, togidere eiyte and fourti, with her surburbabis. 
\v 8 And tho citees that schulen be youun of the possessiouns of sones of Israel, schulen be takun awey, mo fro hem that han more, and fewere `schulen be takun awey fro hem that han lesse, alle bi hem silf schulen yyue bi the mesure of her eritage, citees to dekenes. 
\v 9 The Lord seide to Moises, 
\v 10 Spek thou to the sones of Israel, and thou schalt seie to hem, Whanne ye han passid Jordan, in the lond of Canaan, 
\v 11 deme ye whiche citees owen to be in to the helpis of fugityues, whiche not wilfuli han sched blood. 
\v 12 In whiche whanne the fleere hath fled, the kynesman of hym that is slayn, schal not mow sle hym, til he stonde in the siyt of the multitude, and the cause of hym be demed. 
\v 13 Forsothe of tho citees that ben departid to the helpis of fugityues, 
\v 14 thre schulen be ouer Jordan, and thre in the lond of Canaan; 
\v 15 as wel to the sones of Israel as to comelyngis and pilgryms; that he fle to tho citees, that schedde blood not wilfuli. 
\v 16 If ony man smytith a man with yrun, and he that is smytun is deed, `the smyter schal be gilti of mansleyng, and he schal die. 
\v 17 If he castith a stoon, and a man is deed bi the strook, he schal be punyschid in lijk maner. 
\v 18 If a man smytun with a staf dieth, he schal be vengid bi `the blood of the smytere. 
\v 19 The niy kynesman of hym that is slayn schal sle the mansleere; anoon as he takith hym, `that is, the manquellere, he schal sle hym. 
\v 20 If bi haterede a man hurtlith, `ethir schoufith, `a man, ethir castith ony thing in to hym bi aspiyngis, 
\v 21 ether whanne he was enemy, smoot with hond, and he is deed, the smytere schal be gilti of mansleyng. The kynesman `of him that is slayn, anoon as he findith him, `that is, the sleere, schal sle hym. 
\v 22 That if bi sudeyn caas, and without hatrede and enemytees, 
\v 23 he doith ony thing of these; 
\v 24 and this is preued in heryng `of the puple, and the questioun of blood is discussid bitwixe the smytere and the kynesman, 
\v 25 the innocent schal be delyuered fro the hond of the vengere, and bi sentence of iugis he schal be led ayen in to the citee, to which he fledde, and he schal dwelle there, til the grete preest die, which is anoyntid with oile. 
\v 26 If the sleere is foundun with out the coostis `of the citees that ben asigned to exilid men, 
\v 27 and is slayn of him that is vengere, he that sleeth him, `that is, the exilid man, schal be with out gilt; 
\v 28 for the exilid man ouyte sitte in the citee `til to the `deth of the bischop; forsothe aftir that thilke bischop is deed, the mansleere schal turne ayen in to his lond. 
\v 29 These schulen be euerlastynge and lawful thingis in alle youre dwellyngis. 
\v 30 A mansleere schal be punyschid vndur witnessis; no man schal `be dampned at the witnessyng of o man. 
\v 31 Ye schulen not take prijs of him which is gilti of blood, anoon and he schal die. 
\v 32 Men exilid, and fugityues, schulen not mow turne ayen in ony maner in to her citees, bifore the deeth of the bischop, lest ye defoulen the lond of youre abitacioun, 
\v 33 which is defoulid bi the blood of innocent men; and it may not be clensid in other maner, no but bi the blood of hym, that schedde the blood of anothir man. 
\v 34 And so youre possessioun schal be clensid, for Y schal dwelle with you; for Y am the Lord, that dwelle among the sones of Israel. 
\c 36  
\p
\v 1 Forsothe and the princes of the meynees of Galaad sone of Machir, sone of Manasses, of the generacioun of the sones of Joseph, neiyiden, and spaken to Moises bifor the princes of Israel, 
\v 2 and seiden, The Lord comaundide to thee oure lord, that thou schuldist departe the lond bi lot to the sones of Israel, and that thou schuldist yyue to the douytris of Salphaat, oure brothir, possessioun due to the fadir. 
\v 3 And if men of anothir lynage schulen take to wyues these douytris, her possessioun schal sue, and it schal be translatid to anothir lynage, and schal be decreessid fro oure eritage; 
\v 4 and so it schal be doon, that whanne the iubilee, that is, the fiftithe yeer of remyssioun, cometh, the departyng of lottis be schent, and that the possessioun of othere men passe to othere men. 
\v 5 Moises answeride to the sones of Israel, and seide, for the Lord comaundide, The lynage of the sones of Joseph spak riytfuli, 
\v 6 and this lawe is denounsid of the Lord on the douytris of Salphaat; be thei weddid to whiche men thei wolen, oneli to the men of her lynage; 
\v 7 lest the possessioun of the sones of Joseph be meddlid fro lynage in to lynage. For alle men schulen wedde wyues of her lynage and kynrede; 
\v 8 and alle wymmen \f + \fr 36:8  \ft  and alle wymmen, etc. In Ebreu it is thus, each douyter that schal haue the eritage, schal be wiyf to o man of the kynrede of hir fadir. \f* schulen take hosebondis of the same lynage, that the erytage dwelle in meynees, 
\v 9 and lynagis be not meddlid to hem silf, but dwelle so, 
\v 10 as tho ben departid of the Lord. And the douytris of Salphaat diden, as it was comaundid to hem. 
\v 11 And Maala, and Thersa, and Egla, and Melcha, and Noha, weren weddid to the sones of her fadris brother, 
\v 12 of the meynee of Manaasses, that was `the sone of Joseph, and the possessioun that was youun to hem, dwellide in the lynage and meynee of her fadir. 
\v 13 These ben the comaundementis and domes, whiche the Lord comaundide, bi the hond of Moyses, to the sones of Israel, in the feeldi places of Moab, aboue Jordan, ayens Jericho.
