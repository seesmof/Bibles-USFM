\v 1 These ben the wordis whiche Moyses spak to al Israel ouer Jordan, in the wildirnesse of the feeld, ayens the reed see, bitwix Pharan and Tophel and Laban and Asseroth, where is ful myche gold, 
\v 2 by enleuene daies fro Oreb bi the weie of the hil of Seir, til to Cades Barne. 
\v 3 In the fortithe yeer, in the enleuenth monethe, in the firste dai of the monethe, Moises spak to the sones of Israel alle thingis whiche the Lord commandide to hym that he schulde seie to hem, 
\v 4 after that he smoot Seon, kyng of Ammorreis, that dwellide in Esebon, and Og, the kyng of Basan, that dwelide in Asseroth and in Edray, ouer Jordan, in the lond of Moab. 
\v 5 And Moyses bigan to declare the lawe, and to seie, 
\v 6 Oure Lord God spak to vs in Oreb, and seide, It suffisith to you that ye han dwellid in this hil; 
\v 7 turne ye ayen, and come ye to the hil of Amorreis, and to othere placis that ben next it; to places of feeldis, and of hillis, and to lowere places ayens the south, and bisidis the brenke of the see, to the lond of Cananeys, and of Liban, `til to the greet flood Eufrates. 
\v 8 Lo, `he seith, Y haue youe to you; entre ye, and `welde ye `that lond on which the Lord swoor to youre fadrys, Abraham, Ysaac, and Jacob, that he schulde yyue it to hem, and to her seed after hem. \f + \fr 1:8  \ft  that is, he bihiyt stidefastli \f* 
\v 9 And Y seide to you in that time, Y may not aloone susteyne you, for youre Lord God hath multiplied you, 
\v 10 and ye ben ful many to dai, as the sterris of heuene; 
\v 11 the Lord God of youre fadris adde to this noumbre many thousyndis, and blesse you, as he spak. 
\v 12 Y may not aloone susteyne youre causis, and birthun, and stryues; yyue ye of you men wise `in dyuyn thingis, 
\v 13 and witti `in mennus thingis worthi to be don, whose conuersacioun is preued in youre lynagis, that Y sette hem princes to you. 
\v 14 Thanne ye answeriden to me, The thing is good which thou wolt do. 
\v 15 And Y took of youre lynagis men wise and noble, `in vertues and kyn; and Y ordeynede hem princis, tribunes, and centuryouns, and quynquagenaries, and denys, whiche schulden teche you all thingis. 
\v 16 And Y comaundide to hem, and seide, Here ye hem, and deme ye that that is iust, whether he be a citeseyn, whether a pilgrym. 
\v 17 No difference schal be of persones; ye schulen here so a litil man, `that is, pore, as a greet man, nether ye schulen take the persoone of ony man, for it is the doom of God. That if ony thing semeth hard to you, telle ye to me, and Y schal here. 
\v 18 And Y comaundide alle thingis whiche ye ouyten to do. 
\v 19 Forsothe we yeden forth fro Oreb, and passiden bi a feerdful deseert, and grettiste wildirnesse, which ye sien, bi the weye of the hil of Ammorrey, as oure Lord God comaundide to vs. And whanne we hadden come in to Cades Barne, 
\v 20 Y seide to you, Ye ben comen to the hil of Ammorrey, which youre Lord God schal yyue to you; 
\v 21 se thou the lond which thi Lord God schal yyue to thee; `stie thou, and welde it, as oure Lord God spak to thi fadris; `nyle thou drede, nether `drede thou in herte ony thing. 
\v 22 And alle ye neiyiden to me, and ye seiden, Sende we men, that schulen biholde the lond, and telle to vs bi what weye we owen stie, and to whiche citees we owen to go. 
\v 23 And whanne the word pleside to me,\f + \fr 1:23  \ft  pleside to me, that is, Y consentide for youre vnrestefulnesse. \f* Y sente of you twelue men, of ech lynage oon. 
\v 24 And whanne thei hadden go, and hadden stied in to the hilli places, thei camen `til to the valei of Clustre; and whanne thei hadden biholde the lond, 
\v 25 thei token of the fruytis therof, to schewe the plentee, and brouyten `to vs, and seiden, The lond is good which oure Lord God schal yyue to vs. 
\v 26 And ye `nolden stie, but ye weren vnbileueful to the word of oure Lord God. 
\v 27 And ye grutchiden in youre tabernaclis, and ye seiden, The Lord hatith vs, and herfor he ledde vs out of the lond of Egipt, that he schulde bitake vs in the hond of Ammorey, and schulde do awei vs. 
\v 28 Whidur schulen we stie? the messangeris maden aferd oure herte, and seiden, A grettiste multitude is, and largere in stature than we; the citees ben greete, and wallid `til to the heuene; we sien there the sones of Enachym, that is, giauntis. 
\v 29 And Y seide to you, `Nyle ye drede `with ynne, nether `drede withoutforth; the Lord God hym silf, 
\v 30 which is youre ledere, schal fiyte for you, as he dide in Egipt, while alle men sien. 
\v 31 And ye sien in the wildirnesse, thi Lord God bar thee, as a man is wont to bere his litil sone, in al the weie bi which ye yeden til ye camen to this place. 
\v 32 And sotheli nether so ye bileueden to youre Lord God, that yede bifor you in the weie, 
\v 33 and mesuride the place in which ye ouyten to sette tentis, and schewide in nyyt the weie to you bi fier, and in dai bi a piler of cloude. 
\v 34 And whanne the Lord hadde herd the vois of youre wordis, he was wrooth, 
\v 35 and swoor, and seide, Noon of the men of this werste generacioun schal se the good lond, which Y bihiyte vndur an ooth to youre fadris, 
\v 36 outakun Caleph,\f + \fr 1:36  \ft  outakun Caleph and outakun Josue and Leuytis and children not of xx. yeer. \f* the sone of Jephone; for he schal se it, and Y schal yyue to hym the lond on which he trad, and to hise sones, for he suede the Lord. 
\v 37 Nether the indignacioun ayens the puple is wondirful, sithen the Lord was wrooth also to me for you, and seide, 
\v 38 Nether thou schalt entre thidur, but Josue, the sone of Nun, thi mynystre, he schal entre for thee; excyte and strengthe thou him, and he schal departe the lond bi lot to Israel. 
\v 39 Youre litle children, of whiche ye seiden, that thei schulden be led prisoneris, and the sones that kunnen not to dai the diuersite of good and of yuel, thei schulen entre; and Y schal yyue to hem the lond, and thei schulen welde it. 
\v 40 Sotheli turne ye ayen, and go ye in to the wildirnesse, bi the weie of the Reed See. 
\v 41 And ye answeriden to me, We synneden to the Lord; we schulen stie, and we schulen fiyte, as oure Lord God comaundide. And whanne ye weren arayed with armeris, and yeden `into the hil, the Lord seide to me, 
\v 42 Seie thou to hem, `Nyle ye stye, nether fiyte ye, for Y am not with you, lest ye fallen bifor youre enemyes. 
\v 43 Y spak, and ye herden not; but ye `weren aduersaries to the comaundement of the Lord, and bolnden with prijde, and stieden in to the hil. 
\v 44 Therfor Ammorrey yede out, that dwellide in the hillis, and he cam ayens you, and pursuede you, as bees ben wont to pursue, and killide fro Seir til Horma. And whanne ye turneden ayen, 
\v 45 and wepten bifor the Lord, he herde not you, nether wolde asente to youre vois; 
\v 46 therfor ye saten \f + \fr 1:46  \ft  In Ebreu it is thus, and ye saten in Cades bi many daies, bi the daies in whiche ye saten in othere dwellingis. \f* in Cades Barne bi myche tyme. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 And we yeden forth fro thennus, and camen in to the wildirnesse that ledith to the Reed See, as the Lord seide to me; and we cumpassiden the hil of Seir in long tyme. 
\v 2 And the Lord seide to me, It sufficith to you to cumpasse this hil; 
\v 3 go ye ayens the north. 
\v 4 And comaunde thou to the puple, and seie, Ye schulen passe bi the termes \f + \fr 2:4  \ft  bi the termes, that is, nyy the termes. \f* of youre britheren, the sones of Esau, that dwellen in Seir, and thei schulen drede you. 
\v 5 Therfor se ye diligentli, that ye be not moued ayens hem; for Y schal not yyue to you of the land `of hem as myche as the steppe of o foot may trede, for Y yaf the hil of Seir in to the possessioun of Esau. 
\v 6 Ye schulden bie of hem metis for money, and ye schulen ete; ye schulden drawe, and drynke watir bouyt. 
\v 7 Thi Lord God blesside thee in al the werk of thin hondis; he knewe thi weye, hou thou passidist this moste wildirnesse, bi fourti yeer; and thi Lord God dwellide with thee, and no thing failide to thee. 
\v 8 And whanne we hadden passid bi oure britheren, the sones of Esau, that dwelliden in Seir, bi the weie of the feeld of Elath, and of Asiongaber, we camen to the weie that ledith in to deseert of Moab. 
\v 9 And the Lord seide to me, Fiyte thou not ayens Moabitis, nether bigyn thou batel ayens hem, for Y schal not yyue to thee ony thing of the lond `of hem, for Y yaf Ar in to possessioun to `the sones of Loth. 
\v 10 Emyn, `that is, griseful men, weren first dwelleris therof, a greet puple, and strong, and so hiy, that thei weren bileued as giantis, 
\v 11 of the generacioun of Enachym, and thei weren lijk the sones of Enachym; forsothe Moabitis clepen hem Emyn. 
\v 12 Forsothe Horreis dwelliden bifore in Seir, and whanne thei weren put out, and weren doon awey, `the sones of Esau dwelliden there, as Israel dide in the lond of his possessioun, which the Lord yaf to hym. 
\v 13 Therfor we riseden, that we schulden passe the stronde of Zared, and camen to it. 
\v 14 Sotheli the tyme in whiche we yeden fro Cades Barne `til to the passynge of the stronde of Zared, was of eiyte and thretti yeer, til al the generacioun of `men fiyteris was wastid fro `the castels, as the Lord hadde swore; whos hond was ayens hem, 
\v 15 that thei schulden perische fro the myddis of `the castels. 
\v 16 Forsothe after that alle the fiyteris felden doun, 
\v 17 the Lord spak to me, and seide, 
\v 18 Thou schalt passe to dai the termes of Moab, 
\v 19 the cytee, Ar bi name, and thou schalt neiy in the nyy coost of the sones of Amon; be thou war that thou fiyte not ayens hem, nether be moued to batel; for Y schal not yyue to thee of the lond of the sones of Amon, for Y yaf it to the `sones of Loth in to possessioun. 
\v 20 It is arettid the lond of giauntis, and giauntis enhabitiden therynne sumtyme, whiche giauntis Amonytis clepen Zonym; 
\v 21 a myche puple and greet, and of noble lengthe, as Enachym, whiche the Lord dide awey fro the face of hem, 
\v 22 and made hem to dwelle for `tho giauntis, as he dide to the sones of Esau, that dwellen in Seire, `and dide awai Horreis, and yaf to hem the lond `of Horreis, which `the sones of Esau welden `til in to present tyme. 
\v 23 Also men of Capadocie puttiden out Eueys, that dwelliden in Asseryn, `til to Gaza; which yeden out fro Capadocie, and diden awey Eueis, and dwelliden for hem. 
\v 24 Rise ye, and `passe ye the stronde of Arnon; lo! Y haue bitake in `thin hond Seon, king of Esebon, of Amorreis; and his lond bigynne thou `to welde, and smyte thou batel ayens him. 
\v 25 To dai Y schal bigynne to sende thi drede and strengthe in to puplis that dwellen vndir al heuene, that whanne thi name is herd, thei drede, and tremble bi the maner of wymmen trauelynge of child, and `be holdun with sorewe. 
\v 26 Therfor Y sente messangeris fro the wildirnesse of Cademoch to Seon, kyng of Esebon; and Y seide with pesible wordis, 
\v 27 We schulen passe thorou thi lond, we schulen go in the comyn weie; we schulen not bowe nether to the riyt side, nether to the left side. 
\v 28 Sille thow metis `to vs for prijs, that we ete; yif thow watir for money, and so we schulen drynke. Oneli it is that thou graunte passage to vs, 
\v 29 as the sones of Esau diden, that dwellen in Seir, and as Moabitis diden, that dwellen in Ar, til we comen to Jordan, and passen to the lond which oure Lord God schal yyue to vs. 
\v 30 And Seon, kyng of Esebon, nolde yyue passage `to vs; for thi Lord God made hard his spirit, and made sad in yuel `the herte of hym, that he schulde be bitakun in to thin hondis, as thou seest now. 
\v 31 And the Lord seide to me, Lo, Y bigan to bitake to thee Seon, and his lond; bigynne thou to welde it. 
\v 32 And Seon yede out ayens vs with al his puple to batel in Jasa. 
\v 33 And oure Lord God bitook hym to vs, and we han smyte hym with hise sones, and al his puple. 
\v 34 And we token in that tyme alle the citees, whanne the dwelleris of tho citees, men, and wymmen, and children weren slayn; we leften not in hem ony thing, 
\v 35 outakun beestis that camen in to the part of men takynge prey, and outakun spuylis of the cytees whiche we tokun. 
\v 36 Fro Aroer, which is on the brenke of the stronde of Arnon, fro the toun which is set in the valey, `til to Galaad, no town was ether citee, that ascapide oure hondis. 
\v 37 Oure Lord God bitook alle to vs; outakun the lond of the sones of Amon, to which lond we neiyiden not, and outakun alle thingis that liggen to the stronde of Jeboth, and outakun the citees of the munteyns, and alle places fro whiche oure Lord God forbeed vs. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 And so we turneden, and stieden bi the weie of Basan; and Og, the kyng of Basan, yede out ayens vs with his puple, to fiyte in Edrai. 
\v 2 And the Lord seide to me, Drede thou not hym, for he is bitakun in thin hond, with al his puple, and his lond; and thou schalt do to hym, as thou didist to Seon, kyng of Ammoreis, that dwellide in Esebon. 
\v 3 Therfor oure Lord God bitook in oure hondis also Og, kyng of Basan, and al his puple; and we han smyte hym `til to deeth, 
\v 4 and wastiden alle the citees `of him in o tyme; no town was that ascapide vs; `we destrieden sixti citees, al the cuntrei of Argob, of the rewme of Og in Basan. 
\v 5 Alle the citees weren strengthid with hiyest wallis, and with yatis and barris; with out townes vnnoumbrable, that hadden not wallis. 
\v 6 And we diden awey thilke men, as we diden to Seon, kyng of Esebon; and we losten ech citee, and men, and wymmen, and litle children; 
\v 7 forsothe we token bi prey beestis, and the spuylis of citees. 
\v 8 And we token in that tyme the lond fro the hond of twey kyngis of Ammorreis, that weren biyonde Jordan, fro the stronde of Arnon `til to the hil of Hermon, 
\v 9 `which hil Sidonyes clepen Sarion, and Ammorreis clepen Sanyr. 
\v 10 We tooken alle the citees that weren set in the pleyn, and al the lond of Galaad, and of Basan, `til to Selcha and Edray, citees of the rewme of Og, in Basan. 
\v 11 For Og aloone, kyng of Basan, was left of the generacioun of giauntis; and his yrun bed is schewid, which is in Rabath, of the sones of Amon, and hath nyne cubitis of lengthe, and foure cubitis of breede, at the mesure of a cubit of mannus hond. 
\v 12 And we weldiden in that tyme the lond, fro Aroer, which is on the `brynke of the stronde of Arnon, `til to the myddil paart of the hil of Galaad; and Y yaf the citees `of hym to Ruben and Gad. 
\v 13 Forsothe Y yaf the tother part of Galaad, and al Basan, of the rewme of Og, to the half lynage of Manasses, and al the cuntrei of Argob. Al Basan was clepid the lond of giauntis. 
\v 14 Jair, `sone of Manasses, weldide al the cuntrey of Argob, `til to the lond of Gesuri and of Machati; and he clepide bi his name Basan Anothiair, that is, the townes of Jair, til in to present dai. 
\v 15 Also Y yaf Galaad to Machir; and to the lynagis of Ruben and of Gad Y yaf the lond of Galaad, `til to the strond of Arnon, the myddil of the stronde, 
\v 16 and of the endis `til to the stronde of Jeboth, which is the terme of `the sones of Amon. 
\v 17 And Y yaf the pleyn of the wildernesse `til to Jordan, and the termes of Cenereth `til to the see of deseert, which see is moost salt, at the rotis of the hil of Phasga, ayens the eest. 
\v 18 And Y comaundide to you in that tyme, and seide, Youre Lord God yyueth to you this lond in to erytage; 
\v 19 alle ye stronge men, without wyues and litle children and beestis, be maad redi, and `go ye bifor youre brithren, the sones of Israel. For Y knowe that ye han many beestis, and tho schulen dwelle in citees whiche Y yaf to you, 
\v 20 til the Lord yyue reste to youre brithren, as he yaf to you, and til thei also welden the lond `which the Lord schal yyue to hem biyonde Jordan; thanne ech man schal turne ayen in to his possessioun which Y yaf to you. 
\v 21 Also Y comaundid to Josue in that tyme, and seide, Thin iyen sien what thingis youre Lord God dide to these twei kyngis; so he schal do to alle rewmes, to whiche thou schalt go; drede thou not hem. 
\v 22 And Y preiede the Lord in that tyme, 
\v 23 and seide, Lord God, thou hast bigunne to schewe to thi seruaunt thi greetnesse, and strongeste hond, 
\v 24 for noon other God is ether in heuene, ether in erthe, that mai do thi werkis, and may be comparisound to thi strengthe. 
\v 25 Therfor Y schal passe, and schal se this beeste lond biyende Jordan, and this noble hil and Liban. 
\v 26 And the Lord was wrooth to me for you, nethir he herde me, but seide to me, It suffisith to thee; speke thou no more of this thing to me. 
\v 27 `Stye thou in to the hiynesse of Phasga, and caste aboute thin iyen to the west, and north, and south, and eest, and biholde, for thou schalt not passe this Jordan. 
\v 28 Comaunde thou to Josue, and strengthe thou and coumforte hym; for he schal go bifore this puple, and he schal departe to hem the lond, which thou schalt se. 
\v 29 And we dwelliden in the valey ayens the temple of Phegor. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 And now, thou Israel, here the comaundementis and domes whiche Y teche thee, that thou do tho, and lyue, and that thow entre and welde the lond which the Lord God of youre fadris schal yyue to you. 
\v 2 Ye schulen not adde to the word which Y speke to you,\f + \fr 4:2  \ft  ye schulen not adde to the word etc. Here that adding is forbedun, that depraueth, ether peruertith the vndurstonding of the lawe; that adding, that declarith, ether makith cleer, is not forbedun, bi this that is writun in xxiiij. co. of Ecci. in the name of wisdom, ether of hooly scripture; Thei that declaren me, schulen haue euerlastynge liyf. \f* nether ye schulen take awei `fro it; kepe ye the comaundementis of youre Lord God, which Y comaunde to you. 
\v 3 Youre iyen sien alle thingis whiche the Lord dide ayens Belphegor; how he alto brak alle the worschiperis `of hym fro the myddis of you. 
\v 4 Forsothe ye that cleuen to youre Lord God lyuen alle `til in to present day. 
\v 5 Ye witen that Y tauyte you the comaundementis and riytfulnessis, as my Lord God comaundide to me; so ye schulen do tho in the lond whiche ye schulen welde, 
\v 6 and ye schulen kepe, and schulen fille in werk. For this is youre wisdom \f + \fr 4:6  \ft  wisdom, that is, saueri kunnyng, that bringith in to the loue of God. Sothely the wisdom of filosoforis brouyten more to hiynesse and pride. \f* and vndurstondyng bifor puplis, that alle men here these comaundementis, and seie, Lo! a wise puple and vnderstondynge! a greet folk! 
\v 7 Noon other nacioun is so greet, `not in noumbre ether in bodili quantite, but in dignite, that hath Goddis neiyynge to it silf, as oure God is redi to alle oure bisechyngis. 
\v 8 For whi what other folk is so noble, that it hath cerymonyes and iust domes, and al the lawe which Y schal `sette forth to dai bifor youre iyen? 
\v 9 Therfor kepe thi silf, and thi soule bisili; foryete thou not the wordis whiche thin iyen sien, and falle tho not doun fro thin herte, in alle the daies of thi lijf. Thou schalt teche tho thi sones and thi sones sones. 
\v 10 Telle thou the day in which thou stodist bifor thi Lord God in Oreb, whanne the Lord spak to me, and seide, Gadere thou the puple to me, that it here my wordis, and lerne for to drede me in al tyme in which it lyueth in erthe, and teche hise sones. 
\v 11 And ye neiyiden to the `roote of the hille, that brente `til to heuene; and derknessis, and cloude, and myist weren therynne. 
\v 12 And the Lord spak to you fro the myddis of fier; ye herden the vois of hise wordis, and outirli ye sien no fourme. 
\v 13 And he schewide to you his couenaunt, which he comaundide, that ye schulden do, and `he schewide ten wordis, whiche he wroot in two tablis of stoon. 
\v 14 And he comaundide to me in that tyme, that Y schulde teche you cerymonyes and domes, whiche ye owen to do in the lond whiche ye schulen welde. 
\v 15 Therfor kepe ye bisili youre soulis; ye sien not ony licnesse in the dai in which the Lord spak to you in Oreb, fro the myddis of the fier; 
\v 16 lest perauenture ye be disseyued and make to you a grauun licnesse, ether an ymage of male, ether of female; 
\v 17 a licnesse of alle beestis that ben on erthe, ether of bridis fleynge vndur heuene, 
\v 18 and of crepynge beestis that ben moued in erthe, ether of fischis that dwellen vndur the erthe in watris; lest perauenture, 
\v 19 whanne thin iyen ben reisid to heuene, thou se the sonne, and moone, and alle the sterris of heuene, and be disseyued bi errour, and worschipe tho, `bi outermer reuerence, and onour, `bi ynner reuerence, `tho thingis whiche thi Lord God made of nouyt, in to seruyce to alle folkis that ben vndur heuene. 
\v 20 Forsothe the Lord took you, and ledde out of the yrun furneys of Egipt, that he schulde haue a puple of eritage,\f + \fr 4:20  \ft  a puple of eritage, that is, cleuynge to him vnmouably; as eritage is possessioun vnmouable. \f* as it is in `present dai. 
\v 21 And the Lord was wrooth ayens me for youre wordis, and swoor that Y schulde not passe Jordan, and schulde not entre in to the beeste lond, which he schal yyue to you. 
\v 22 Lo! Y die in this erthe; Y schal not passe Jordan; ye schulen passe, and schulen welde the noble lond. 
\v 23 Be thou war, lest ony tyme thou foryete the couenaunt of thi Lord God, which he made with thee, and lest thou make to thee a grauun licness of tho thingis whiche the Lord forbeed to make. 
\v 24 For thi Lord God is fier wastynge \f + \fr 4:24  \ft  fier wastinge, that is, punyschinge scharply, as fier among othere elementis worchith more. \f* ; `God, a feruent louyere. 
\v 25 If ye gendren sones, and sones of sones, and ye dwellen in the lond, and ye be disceyued, and make to you ony licnesse, and doen yuel bifor youre Lord God, that ye terren hym to greet wrathe, 
\v 26 Y clepe witnesses to dai heuene and erthe, `that is, ech resonable creature beynge in heuene and in erthe, that ye schulen perische soone fro the lond, which ye schulen welde, whanne ye han passid Jordan; ye schulen not dwelle long tyme therynne, but the Lord schal do awey you, 
\v 27 and schal scatere `in to alle hethen men, and ye schulen leeue fewe among naciouns, to whiche the Lord schal lede you. 
\v 28 And there ye schulen serue to goddis, that ben maad bi `the hond of men, to a tre and a stoon, that `seen not, nether heren, nether eten, nether smellen. 
\v 29 And whanne thou hast souyt there \f + \fr 4:29  \ft  in the heestis, domes, and in cerymonies, paciently abidinge the Lord. \f* thi Lord God, thou schalt fynde hym; if netheles thou sekist with al the herte, and with al the tribulacioun of thi soule. 
\v 30 Aftir that alle thingis han founde thee, that ben biforseid,\f + \fr 4:30  \ft  that is, after alle these forseid thinges ben bifallen to thee. \f* forsothe in the laste tyme, thou schalt turne ayen to thi Lord God, and thou schalt here his vois. 
\v 31 For thi Lord God is merciful God; he schal not forsake thee, nethir he schal do awey outirli, nethir he schal foryete the couenaunt, in which he swoor to thi fadris. 
\v 32 Axe thou of elde daies that weren bifor thee, fro the day in which thi Lord God made of nouyt man on erthe, axe thou fro that oon ende of heuene `til to the tother ende therof,\f + \fr 4:32  \ft  that is, take hede to alle thinges that euer weren do. \f* if sich a thing was doon ony tyme, ether if it was euere knowun, 
\v 33 that a puple herde the vois of God spekynge fro the myddis of the fier, as thou herdist, and siest;

\v 2 and seide to hem, Y am to dai of an hundrid and twenti yeer, Y may no ferthere go out and go yn, moost sithen also the Lord seide to me, Thou schalt not passe this Jordan. 
\v 3 Therfor thi Lord God schal passe bifore thee; he schal do awei these folkis in thi siyt, and thou schalt welde hem; and this Josue schal go bifor thee, as the Lord spak. 
\v 4 And the Lord schal do to hem as he dide to Seon, and Og kyng of Ammorreis, and to `the lond of hem; and he schal do hem awey. 
\v 5 Therfor whanne the Lord hath bitake to you also hem, ye schulen do in lijk maner to hem, as Y comaundide to you. 
\v 6 Do ye manli, and be ye coumfortid; nyle ye drede in herte, nethir drede ye at the siyt of hem, for thi Lord God hym silf is thi ledere, and he schal not leeue, nether schal forsake thee. 
\v 7 And Moyses clepid Josue, and seide to hym bifor al the multitude of the sones of Israel, Be thou coumfortid, and be thou strong; for thou schalt lede this puple in to the lond which the Lord swoor that he schal yyue to `the fadris of hem; and thou schalt departe it bi lot. 
\v 8 And the Lord hym silf whiche is youre ledere, schal be with thee, he schal not leeue, nether schal forsake thee; nyle thou drede, nether drede thou in herte. 
\v 9 Therfor Moyses wroot this lawe, and bitook it to the preestis, sones of Leuy, that baren the arke of the bond of pees of the Lord, and to alle the eldere men of Israel. 
\v 10 And Moyses comaundide to hem, and seide, Aftir seuen yeer, in the yeer of remyssioun, in the solempnete of tabernaclis, 
\v 11 whanne alle men of Israel schulen come togidere, that thei appere in the siyt of her Lord God, in the place `which the Lord chees, thou schalt rede the wordis of this lawe bifor al Israel, 
\v 12 while thei heren, and while al the puple is gaderid to gidere, as wel to men, as to wymmen, to litle children, and comelyngis that ben with ynne thi yatis; that thei here, and lerne, and drede youre Lord God, and kepe and fille alle the wordis of this lawe; 
\v 13 also that the sones of hem, that now knowen not, moun here, and that thei drede her Lord God in alle daies in whiche thei lyuen in the lond to whiche ye schulen go to gete, whanne Jordan is passid. 
\v 14 And the Lord seide to Moises, Lo! the daies of thi deeth ben nyy; clepe thou Josue, and stonde ye in the tabernacle of witnessyng, that Y comaunde to hym. Therfor Moises and Josue yeden, and stooden in the tabernacle of witnessyng; 
\v 15 and the Lord apperide there in a pilere of cloude, that stood in the entryng of the tabernacle. 
\v 16 And the Lord seide to Moises, Lo! thou schalt slepe with thi fadris, and this puple schal rise, and schal do fornycacioun aftir alien goddis in the lond, to which lond it schal entre, that it dwelle ther ynne; there it schal forsake me, and schal make void the boond of pees, which Y couenauntide with it. 
\v 17 And my strong veniaunce schal be wrooth ayens that puple in that dai, and Y schal forsake it, and Y schal hide my face fro it, and it schal be in to deuouryng; alle yuels and turmentyngis schulen fynde it, so that it seie in that dai, Verili for the Lord is not with me, these yuelis han founde me. 
\v 18 Forsothe Y schal hide, and schal hile `my face in that dai, for alle the yuels `whiche it dide, for it suede alien goddis. 
\v 19 Now therfor write ye to you this song, and `teche ye the sones of Israel, that thei holde it in mynde, and synge bi mouth; and that this song be to me for a witnessyng among the sones of Israel. 
\v 20 For Y schal lede hym in to the lond, for which Y swoor to hise fadris, flowynge with mylk and hony; and whanne thei han ete, and ben fillid, and ben maad fat, thei schulen turne to alien goddis, and thei schulen serue hem; and thei schulen bacbite me, and schulen make voide my couenaunt. 
\v 21 Aftir that many yuels and turmentyngis han founde hym, this song schal answere hym for witnessing, which song no foryetyng schal do awey fro the mouth of thi seed. For Y knowe the thouytis therof to day, what thingis it schal do, bifore that Y bringe it in to the lond which Y bihiyte to it. 
\v 22 Therfor Moises wroot the song, and tauyte the sones of Israel. 
\v 23 And the Lord comaundide to Josue, the sone of Nun, and seide, Be thou coumfortid, and be thou strong; for thou schalt lede the sones of Israel in to the lond which Y bihiyte, and Y schal be with thee. 
\v 24 Therfor aftir that Moises wroot the wordis of this lawe in a book, and fillide, 
\v 25 he comaundide to Leuytis \f + \fr 31:25  \ft  to Leuylis, that is, to prestis of the lynage of Leuy. \f* that baren the ark of boond of pees of the Lord, 
\v 26 and seide, Take ye this book, and putte ye it in the side of the arke of boond of pees of youre Lord God, that it be there ayens thee in to witnessyng. 
\v 27 For Y knowe thi stryuyng, and thin hardest nol; yit while Y lyuede and entride with you, ye diden euere stryuyngli ayens the Lord; hou myche more whanne Y schal be deed. 
\v 28 Gadere ye to me all the grettere men in birthe, and techeris, bi youre lynagis, and Y schal speke to hem, herynge these wordis, and Y schal clepe ayens hem heuene and erthe. 
\v 29 For Y knowe, that aftir my deeth ye schulen do wickidli, and schulen bowe awei soone fro the weie which Y comaundide to you; and yuels schulen come to you in the laste tyme, whanne ye `han do yuel in the siyt of the Lord, that ye terre hym to ire bi the werkis of youre hondis. 
\v 30 Therfor while al the cumpeny of the sones of Israel herde, Moises spak the wordis of this song, and fillide `til to the ende. 
\c 32  
\p
\v 1 Ye heuenes, here what thingis Y schal speke; the erthe here the wordis of my mouth. 
\v 2 My techyng wexe togidere as reyn; my speche flete out as dew, as lytil reyn on eerbe, and as dropis on gras. 
\v 3 For Y schal inwardli clepe the name of the Lord; yyue ye glorie to oure God. 
\v 4 The werkis of God ben perfit, and alle hise weies ben domes; God is feithful, and without ony wickidnesse; God is iust and riytful. 
\v 5 Thei synneden ayens hym, and not hise sones in filthis, `that is, of idolatrie; schrewid and waiward generacioun. 
\v 6 Whether thou yeldist these thingis to the Lord, thou fonned puple and vnwijs? Whether he is not thi fadir, that weldide thee, and made, `and made thee of nouyt? 
\v 7 Haue thou minde of elde daies, thenke thou alle generaciouns; axe thi fadir, and he schal telle to thee, axe thi grettere men, and thei schulen seie to thee. 
\v 8 Whanne the hiyeste departide folkis, whanne he departide the sones of Adam, he ordeynede the termes of puplis bi the noumbre of the sones of Israel.\f + \fr 32:8  \ft  of the sones of Israel, the translacioun of lxx. hath, of the sones of God. \f* 
\v 9 Forsothe the part of the Lord is his puple; Jacob is the litil part of his eritage. 
\v 10 The Lord foond hym in a deseert lond, `that is, priued of Goddis religioun, in the place of orrour `ethir hidousnesse, and of wast wildirnesse; the Lord ledde hym aboute, and tauyte hym, and kepte as the apple of his iye. 
\v 11 As an egle stirynge his briddis to fle, and fleynge on hem, he spredde forth his wyngis, and took hem, and bar in hise schuldris. 
\v 12 The Lord aloone was his ledere, and noon alien god was with hym. 
\v 13 The Lord ordeynede hym on an hiy lond, that he schulde ete the fruytis of feeldis, that he schulde souke hony of a stoon, and oile of the hardeste roche; 
\v 14 botere \f + \fr 32:14  \ft  butre geten bi traueil is pacience in aduersite, sweet milk is loue that nurschith vertu, fatnesse is good ensaumple flowinge charitabli to other. \f* of the droue, and mylke of scheep, with the fatnesse of lambren and of rammes, of the sones of Basan; and that he schulde ete kydis with the merowe of wheete, and schulde drynke the cleereste blood of grape. 
\v 15 The louede puple was `maad fat, and kikide ayen \f + \fr 32:15  \ft  it wynside, it was maad fatt, ful gretid and out largid fat, and it wynsede ayen God bi grucchinge and vnfeithfulnesse; it was maad fat with oute forth, it was maad fat with inne forth, and alargid bi good fame. \f* ; maad fat withoutforth, maad fat with ynne, and alargid; he forsook God his makere, and yede awei fro `God his helthe. 
\v 16 Thei terriden hym to ire in alien goddis, and thei excitiden to wrathfulnesse in abhomynaciouns. 
\v 17 Thei offriden to feendis, and not to God, to goddis whiche thei knewen not, newe goddis, and freische camen, whiche `the fadris of hem worschipiden not. 
\v 18 Thou hast forsake God that gendride thee, and thou hast foryete `thi Lord creatour. 
\v 19 The Lord siy, and was stirid to wrathfulnesse; for hise sones and douytris terriden hym. 
\v 20 And the Lord seide, Y schal hyde my face fro hem, and Y schal biholde `the laste thingis of hem; for it is a waiward generacioun, and vnfeithful sones. 
\v 21 Thei terriden me in hym that was not God, and thei `terriden to ire in her vanytees; and Y schal terre hem in hym, that is not a puple, and Y schal terre hem `to yre in a fonned folk. 
\v 22 Fier, that is, peyne maad redi to hem, is kyndlid in my stronge veniaunce, and it schal brenne `til to the laste thingis of helle; and it schal deuoure the lond with his fruyt, and it schal brenne the foundementis of hillis. 
\v 23 Y schal gadere `yuels on hem, and Y schal fille myn arewis in hem. 
\v 24 Thei schulen be waastid with hungur, and briddis schulen deuoure hem with bitteriste bityng; Y schal sende in to hem the teeth of beestis, with the woodnesse of wormes drawynge on erthe, and of serpentis. 
\v 25 Swerd with outforth and drede with ynne schal waaste hem; a yong man and a virgyn togidre, a soukynge child with an elde man. 
\v 26 And Y seide, Where ben thei? Y schal make the mynde of hem to ceesse of men. 
\v 27 But Y delayede for the yre of enemyes, lest perauenture `the enemyes of hem shulden be proude, and seie, Oure hiy hond, and not the Lord, dide alle these thingis. 
\v 28 It is a folk with out counsel, and with out prudence; 
\v 29 Y wolde that thei saueriden, and `vnderstoden, and purueiden the laste thingis. 
\v 30 How pursuede oon of enemyes a thousynde of Jewis, and tweyne dryuen awey ten thousynde? Whether not therfore for her God selde hem, and the Lord closide hem togidere? 
\v 31 For oure God is not as the goddis of hem, and oure enemyes ben iugis. 
\v 32 The vyner of hem is of the vyner of Sodom, and of the subarbis of Gomorre; the grape of hem is the grape of galle, and the clustre is most bittir. 
\v 33 The galle of dragouns is the wyn of hem, and the venym of eddris, that may not be heelid. 
\v 34 Whether these thingis ben not hid at me, and ben seelid in myn tresouris? 
\v 35 Veniaunce is myn, and Y schal yelde to hem in tyme, that the foot of hem slide; the dai of perdicioun is nyy, and tymes hasten to be present. 
\v 36 The Lord schal deme his puple, and he schal do merci in hise seruauntis; the puple schal se that the hond of fiyteres is sijk, and also men closid failiden, and the residues ben waastid. 
\v 37 And thei \f + \fr 32:37  \ft  and they, that is, good men among the Jewis. \f* schulen seie, Where ben `the goddis of hem, in whiche thei hadden trust? 
\v 38 Of whos sacrifices thei eeten fatnessis, and drunkun the wyn of fletynge sacrifices, rise thei and helpe you, and defende thei you in nede. 
\v 39 Se ye that Y am aloone, and noon other God is outakun me; Y schal sle, and Y schal make to lyue; Y schal smyte, and Y schal make hool; and noon is that may delyuere fro myn hond. 
\v 40 And Y schal reise myn hond to heuene, and Y schal seie, Y lyue with outen ende. 
\v 41 If Y schal whette my swerd as leit, and myn hond schal take doom, Y schal yelde veniaunce to myn enemyes, and Y schal quyte to hem that haten me. 
\v 42 Y schal fille myn arewis with blood, and my swerd schal deuoure fleischis \f + \fr 32:42  \ft  that is, hem that lyuen after the fleshe. \f* of the blood of hem that ben slayn, and of the caitifte of the heed of enemyes maad nakid.\f + \fr 32:42  \ft  of the blood of hem that ben slain here thury deedly synne, and of the caitiftee of auntecrist her heed, maad nakid of Goddis help, Crist shal take veniaunce, and distric hem alle with his word. \f* 
\v 43 Folkis, preise ye the puplis of hym, for he schal venie the blood of hise seruauntis, and he schal yelde veniaunce in to the enemyes of hem; and he schal be merciful to the lond of his puple. 
\v 44 Therfor Moises cam, and spak alle the wordis of this song in the eeris of the puple; bothe he and Josue, the sone of Nun. 
\v 45 And `he fillide alle these wordis, and spak to alle Israel, and seide to hem, 
\v 46 Putte ye youre hertis in to alle the wordis whiche Y witnesse to you to day, that ye comaunde to youre sones, to kepe, and do tho, and to fulfille alle thingis that ben writun in the book of this lawe; 
\v 47 for not in veyn tho ben comaundid to you, but that alle men schulden lyue in tho; whiche wordis ye schulen do, and schulen contynue in long tyme in the lond, to which ye schulen entre to welde, whanne Jordan is passid. 
\v 48 And the Lord spak to Moises in the same day, 
\v 49 and seide, Stie thou in to this hil Abirym, that is, passyng, in to the hil of Nebo, which is in the lond of Moab, ayens Jerico; and se thou the lond of Canaan, which Y schal yyue to the sones of Israel to holde, and die thou in the hil. 
\v 50 In to which hil thou schalt stie, and schalt be ioyned to thi puplis, as Aaron, thi brother, was deed in the hil of Hor, and was put to his puplis. 
\v 51 For ye trespassiden ayens me, in the myddis of the sones of Israel, at the Watris of Ayenseiyng, in Cades of deseert of Syn; and ye halewiden not me among the sones of Israel. 
\v 52 Ayenward thou schalt se the lond, and schalt not entre in to it, which Y schal yyue to the sones of Israel. 
\c 33  
\p
\v 1 This is the blessing, bi which Moises, the man of God, blesside the sones of Israel bifor his deeth; 
\v 2 and seide, The Lord cam fro Syna, and he roos to us fro Seir; he apperide fro the hil of Pharan, and thousandis of seyntis with hym; a lawe of fier in his riythond. 
\v 3 He louede puplis; alle seyntis ben in his hond, and thei that neiyen to hise feet schulen take of his doctryn. 
\v 4 Moisis comaundide lawe `to vs, eritage \f + \fr 33:4  \ft  eritage, for eritage is a thing vnmoutable. So the lawe was youun to Jewis, that it schulde be kept of hem vnmouably. \f* of the multitude of Jacob. 
\v 5 And the king schal be at the moost riytful, whanne princes of the puple schulen be gaderid togidere with the lynagis of Israel. 
\v 6 Ruben lyue, and die not, and be he litil in noumbre. 
\v 7 This is the blessyng of Juda; Lord, here thou the vois of Juda, and brynge in hym to his puple; hise hondis schulen fiyte for hym, and the helpere of hym schal be ayens hise aduersaries. 
\v 8 Also he seide to Leuy, Thi perfeccioun and thi techyng is of an hooly man, whom thou preuedist in temptacioun, and demedist at the Watris of Ayenseiynge; 
\v 9 which Leuy seide to his fadir and to his modir, Y knowe not you, and to hise britheren, Y knowe not hem; and knewen not her sones. These kepten thi speche, and these kepten thi couenaunt; A! 
\v 10 Jacob, thei kepten thi domes, and `thou, Israel, thei kepten thi lawe; thei schulen putte encense in thi strong veniaunce,\f + \fr 33:10  \ft  putte encense in thi strong veniaunce, that is, to turn awey thi strong veniaunce fro thi peple. \f* and brent sacrifice on thin auter. 
\v 11 Lord, blesse thou the strengthe of hym, and resseyue thou the werkis of his hondis; smyte thou the backis of hise enemyes, and thei that haten hym, rise not. 
\v 12 And he seide to Benjamyn, The moost loued of the Lord schal dwelle tristili in hym, `that is, in the Lord; he schal dwelle al day as in a chaumbur, and he schal reste bitwixe the schuldris of hym. 
\v 13 Also he seide to Joseph, `His lond is of the Lordis blessyng; of the applis of heuene, and of the dewe, and of watir liggynge bynethe; 
\v 14 of the applis of fruytis of the sunne and moone; of the coppe of elde munteyns, 
\v 15 and of the applis of euerlastynge litle hillis; 
\v 16 and of the fruytis of the lond, and of the fulnesse therof. The blessyng of hym that apperide in the busch come on the heed of Joseph, and on the cop of Nazarey, `that is, hooli, among hise britheren. 
\v 17 As the first gendrid of a bole is the feirnesse of hym; the hornes of an vnicorn ben the hornes of hym; in tho he schal wyndewe folkis, `til to the termes of erthe. These ben the multitudis of Effraym, and these ben the thousyndis of Manasses. 
\v 18 And he seide to Zabulon, Zabulon, be thou glad in thi goyng out, and, Ysacar, in thi tabernaclis. 
\v 19 Thei schulen clepe puplis to the hil, there thei schulen offre sacrifices of riytfulnesse; whiche schulen souke the flowing of the see as mylk, and hid tresours of grauel. 
\v 20 And he seide to Gad, Gad is blessid in broodnesse; he restide as a lioun, and he took the arm and the nol. 
\v 21 And he siy his prinshed, that `the techere was kept in his part; which Gad was with the princes of the puple, and dide the riytfulnesses of the Lord, and his doom with Israel. 
\v 22 Also he seide to Dan, Dan, a whelp of a lioun, schal flowe largeli fro Basan. 
\v 23 And he seide to Neptalym, Neptalym schal vse abundaunce, and he schal be ful with blessyngis of the Lord; and he schal welde the see \f + \fr 33:23  \ft  he schal welde the see, etc.; for the see of Galilee, as to the south part therof, felde in the lot of Neptalym. \f* and the south. 
\v 24 Also he seide to Aser, Aser, be blessid in sones, and plese he hise britheren; dippe he his foot in oile. 
\v 25 Yrun and bras the scho of hym; as the dai of thi youthe so and thin eelde. 
\v 26 Noon other god is as the God of the moost riytful, that is, `as the God `of the puple of Israel, gouerned bi moost riytful lawe; the stiere of heuene is thin helpere; cloudis \f + \fr 33:26  \ft  cloudis. In Ebrew it is, heuenes and armes of the world. \f* rennen aboute bi the glorie of hym.

\v 28 Israel schal dwelle trustili and aloone; the iye of Jacob in the lond of whete, and of wyn; and heuenes schulen be derk with dew. 
\v 29 Blessed art thou, Israel; thou puple that art saued in the Lord, who is lijk thee? The scheld of thin help and the swerd of thi glorie is thi God; thin enemyes schulen denye thee, and thou schalt trede her neckis.
