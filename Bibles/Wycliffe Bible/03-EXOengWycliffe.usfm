\v 1 These ben the names of the sones of Israel, that entriden into Egipt with Jacob; alle entriden with her housis; 
\v 2 Ruben, Symeon, 
\v 3 Leuy, Judas, Isachar, Zabulon, and Benjamin, 
\v 4 Dan, and Neptalim, Gad, and Aser. 
\v 5 Therfor alle the soules of hem that yeden out of `the hipe of Jacob weren seuenti and fyue. 
\v 6 Forsothe Joseph was in Egipt; and whanne he was deed, and alle hise brithren, and al his kynrede, 
\v 7 the sones of Israel encreessiden, and weren multiplied as buriounnyng, and thei weren maad strong greetli, and filliden the lond. 
\v 8 A newe kyng, that knewe not Joseph, roos in the meene tyme on Egipt, and seide to his puple, Lo! 
\v 9 the puple of the sones of Israel is myche, and strongere than we; 
\v 10 come ye, wiseli oppresse we it, lest perauenture it be multiplied; and lest, if batel risith ayens vs, it be addid to oure enemyes, and go out of the lond, whanne we ben ouercomun. 
\v 11 And so he made maistris of werkis souereyns to hem, that thei schulden turmente hem with chargis. And thei maden citees of tabernaclis to Farao, Fiton, and Ramesses. 
\v 12 And bi hou myche thei oppressiden hem, bi so myche thei weren multiplied, and encreessiden more. 
\v 13 And Egipcians hatiden the sones of Israel, and turmentiden, and scorneden hem; 
\v 14 and brouyten her lijf to bitternesse bi hard werkis of cley and to tijl stoon, and bi al seruage, bi which thei weren oppressid in the werkis of erthe. 
\v 15 Forsothe the kyng of Egipt seide to the mydwyues of Ebrews, of whiche oon was clepid Sefora, the tother Fua; 
\v 16 and he commaundide to hem, Whanne ye schulen do the office of medewyues to Ebrew wymmen, and the tyme of childberyng schal come, if it is a knaue child, sle ye him; if it is a womman, kepe ye. 
\v 17 Forsothe the medewyues dredden God, and diden not bi the comaundement of the kyng of Egipt, but kepten knaue children. 
\v 18 To whiche clepid to hym the kyng seide, What is this thing which ye wolden do, that ye wolden kepe the children? 
\v 19 Whiche answeriden, Ebrew wymmen ben not as the wymmen of Egipt, for thei han kunnyng of the craft of medewijf, and childen bifore that we comen to hem. 
\v 20 Therfor God dide wel to medewyues; and the puple encreesside, and was coumfortid greetli. 
\v 21 And for the mydewyues dredden God, he bildide `housis to hem. 
\v 22 Therfor Farao comaundide al his puple, and seide, What euer thing of male kynde is borun to Ebrewis, `caste ye into the flood; what euer thing of wymmen kynde, kepe ye. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 Aftir these thingis a man of `the hows of Leuy yede out, and took a wijf \f + \fr 2:1  \ft  took a wiyf into fleisly coupling: for sche was his wiyf bifore, and hadde childid Aaron and Marie his sister. \f* of his kyn, 
\v 2 which conseyuede, and childide a sone. And sche seiy hym wel farynge, and hidde him bi thre monethis. 
\v 3 And whanne sche myyte not hele, thanne sche took a `leep of segge, and bawmede it with tar and pitch, and puttide the yong child with ynne, and puttide hym forth in a `place of spier of the brenke of the flood, 
\v 4 the while his sistir stood afer, and bihelde the bifalling of the thing. 
\v 5 Lo! forsothe the douytir of Farao cam doun to be waischun in the flood, and hir damysels walkiden bi the brenke of the flood. And whanne sche hadde seyn a leep in the `place of spier, sche sente oon of hir seruauntessis, 
\v 6 and sche openyde the leep brouyt to hir, and seiy a litil child wepynge ther ynne. And sche hadde mercy on the child, and seide, It is of the yonge children of Ebrews. 
\v 7 To whom the `sister of the child seide, Wolt thou that Y go, and clepe to thee an Ebrew womman, that may nurische the yong child? 
\v 8 She answeride, Go thou. The damysel yede, and clepide the `modir of the child. 
\v 9 To whom `the douytir of Farao spak, and seide, Take thou this child, and nurische to me; Y schal yyue to thee thi mede. The womman took, and nurischide the child, and bitook hym woxun to `the douytir of Farao, 
\v 10 whom sche purchaside `in to the place of sone; and sche clepide his name Moises, and seide, For Y took hym fro the watir. 
\v 11 In tho daies, aftir that Moises encreesside, he yede out to hise britheren, and seiy the turment of hem, and a man Egipcian smytynge `oon of Ebrews, hise britheren. 
\v 12 And whanne he hadde biholdun hidur and thidir, and hadde seyn, that no man was present, he killide the Egipcian, and hidde in soond. 
\v 13 And he yede out in another dai, and seiy tweyne Ebrews chidynge, and he seide to hym that dide wrong, Whi smytist thou thi brother? 
\v 14 Which answeride, Who ordeynede thee prince, ether iuge on vs? Whether thou wolt sle me, as thou killidist yisterdai the Egipcian? Moises dredde, and seide, Hou is this word maad opun? 
\v 15 And Farao herde this word, and souyte to sle Moyses, which fledde fro his siyt, and dwellide in the lond of Madian, and sat bisidis a pit. 
\v 16 Forsothe seuene douytris weren to the preest of Madian, that camen to drawe watir; and whanne the trouyis weren fillid, thei coueitiden to watere `the flockis of her fadir. 
\v 17 Scheepherdis camen aboue, and dreuen hem awei; and Moises roos, and defendide the dameselis; and he watride `the scheep of hem. 
\v 18 And whanne thei hadden turned ayen to Jetro, her fadir, he seide to hem, Whi camen ye swiftliere than ye weren wont? 
\v 19 Thei answeriden, A man of Egipt delyuerede vs fro the hond of scheepherdis; ferthermore and he drow watir with vs, and yaf drynk to the scheep. 
\v 20 And he seide, Where is that man? whi leften ye the man? clepe ye hym, that he ete breed. 
\v 21 Therfor Moises swoor, that he wolde dwelle with Jetro; and he took a wijf, Sefora, `the douyter of Jetro. 
\v 22 And sche childide a sone to hym, whom he clepide Gersan, and seide, Y was a comelyng in an alyen lond. Forsothe sche childide an othir sone, whom he clepide Eliezer, and seide, For God of my fadir is myn helpere, and delyuerede me fro the hond of Farao. 
\v 23 Forsothe aftir myche tyme the kyng of Egipt diede, and the sones of Israel inwardli weiliden for werkis, and crieden, and the cry of hem for werkis stiede to God. 
\v 24 And he herde the weilyng of hem, and he hadde mynde of the boond of pees, which he hadde maad with Abraham, Ysaac, and Jacob; and he bihelde the sones of Israel, 
\v 25 and knewe hem. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 Forsothe Moises kepte the scheep of Jetro, `his wyues fadir, preest of Madian; and whanne he hadde dryue the floc to the ynnere partis of deseert, he cam to Oreb, the hil of God. 
\v 2 Forsothe the Lord apperide to hym in the flawme of fier fro the myddis of the buysch, and he seiy that the buysch brente, and was not forbrent. 
\v 3 Therfor Moyses seide, Y schal go and schal se this greet siyt, whi the buysch is not forbrent. 
\v 4 Sotheli the Lord seiy that Moises yede to se, and he clepide Moises fro the myddis of the buysch, and seide, Moyses! Moises! Which answeride, Y am present. 
\v 5 And the Lord seide, Neiye thou not hidur, but vnbynde thou the scho of thi feet, for the place in which thou stondist is hooli lond. 
\v 6 And the Lord seide, Y am God of thi fadir, God of Abraham, and God of Isaac, and God of Jacob. Moises hidde his face, for he durste not biholde ayens God. 
\v 7 To whom the Lord seide, Y seiy the affliccion of my puple in Egipt, and Y herde the cry therof, for the hardnesse of hem that ben souereyns of werkis. 
\v 8 And Y knew the sorewe of the puple, and Y cam down to delyuere it fro the hondis of Egipcians, and lede out of that lond in to a good lond and brood, into a lond that flowith with milk and hony, to the places of Cananey, and of Ethei, of Amorrey, and of Feresei, of Euey, and of Jebusei. 
\v 9 Therfor the cry of the sones of Israel cam to me, and Y seiy the turment of hem, bi which thei ben oppressid of Egipcians. 
\v 10 But come thou, I schal sende thee to Farao, that thou lede out my puple, the sones of Israel, fro Egipt. 
\v 11 And Moises seide to hym, Who am Y, that Y go to Farao, and lede out the sones of Israel fro Egipt? 
\v 12 And the Lord seide to Moises, Y schal be with thee, and thou schalt haue this signe, that Y haue sent thee, whanne thou hast led out my puple fro Egipt, thou schalt offre to God on this hil. 
\v 13 Moises seide to God, Lo! Y schal go to the sones of Israel, and Y schal seie to hem, God of youre fadris sente me to you; if thei schulen seie to me, what is his name, what schal Y seie to hem? 
\v 14 The Lord seide to Moises, Y am that am. The Lord seide, Thus thou schalt seie to the sones of Israel, He that is sente me to you. 
\v 15 And eft God seide to Moises, Thou schalt seie these thingis to the sones of Israel, The Lord God of youre fadris, God of Abraham, and God of Isaac, and God of Jacob, sente me to you; this name is to me with outen ende, \f + \fr 3:15  \ft  for thes thre witnessis lyuen withouten eende. \f* and this is my memorial in generacioun and in to generacioun. 
\v 16 Go thou, gadere thou the eldere men, that is, iugis, of Israel, and thou schalt seie to hem, The Lord God of youre fadris apperide to me, God of Abraham, and God of Ysaac, and God of Jacob, and seide, Y visitynge haue visitid you, and Y seiy alle thingis that bifelden to you in Egipt; 
\v 17 and Y seide, that Y lede out you fro the affliccioun of Egipt in to the lond of Cananey, and of Ethei, and of Amorrei, and of Ferezei and of Euei, and of Jebusei, to the lond flowynge with mylk and hony. 
\v 18 And thei schulen here thi vois; and thou schalt entre, and the eldere men of Israel to the kyng of Egipt, and thou schalt seie to hym, The Lord God of Ebrews clepide vs; we schulen go the weie of thre daies in to wildirnesse, that we offre to oure Lord God. 
\v 19 But Y woot, that the kyng of Egipt schal not delyuere you that ye go, but bi strong hond; 
\v 20 for Y schal holde forthe myn hond, and I schal smyte Egipt in alle my marueils, whiche Y schal do in the myddis of hem; aftir these thingis he schal delyuere you. 
\v 21 And Y schal yyue grace to this puple bifore Egipcians, and whanne ye schulen go out, ye schulen not go out voide; 
\v 22 but a womman schal axe of hir neiyboresse and of her hoosteesse siluerne vesselis, and goldun, and clothis, and ye schulen putte tho on youre sones and douytris, and ye schulen make nakid Egipt.

\v 1 Moyses answeride, and seide, The comyns schulen not bileue to me, nether thei schulen here my vois; but thei schulen seie, The Lord apperide not to thee. 
\v 2 Therfor the Lord seide to hym, What is this that thou holdist in thin hond? Moises answeride, A yerde. 
\v 3 And the Lord seide, Caste it forth into erthe; and he castide forth, and it was turned in to a serpent, so that Moises fledde. 
\v 4 And the Lord seide, Holde forth thin hond, and take the tail therof; he stretchide forth, and helde, and it was turned in to a yerde. 
\v 5 And the Lord seide, That thei bileue, that the Lord God of thi fadris apperide to thee, God of Abraham, and God of Isaac, and God of Jacob. 
\v 6 And the Lord seide eft, Putte thin hond in to thi bosum; and whanne he hadde put it in to the bosum, he brouyte forth it leprouse, at the licnesse of snow. 
\v 7 The Lord seide, Withdrawe thin hond in to thi bosum; he withdrow, and brouyte forth eft, and it was lijc the tother fleisch. 
\v 8 The Lord seide, If thei schulen not bileue to thee, nether schulen here the word of the formere signe, thei schulen bileue to the word of the signe suynge; 
\v 9 that if thei bileuen not sotheli to these twei signes, nether heren thi vois, take thou watir of the flood, and schedde out it on the drie lond, and what euer thing thou schalt drawe vp of the flood, it schal be turned in to blood. 
\v 10 Moises seide, Lord, Y biseche, Y am `not eloquent fro yistirdai and the thridde dai ago; and sithen thou hast spokun to thi seruaunt, Y am of more lettid and slowere tunge. 
\v 11 The Lord seide to hym, Who made the mouth of man, ether who made a doumb man and `deef, seynge and blynd? whether not Y? 
\v 12 Therfor go thou, and Y schal be in thi mouth, and Y schal teche thee what thou schalt speke. 
\v 13 And he seide, Lord, Y biseche, sende thou whom thou schalt sende. 
\v 14 And the Lord was wrooth ayens Moises, and seide, Y woot, that Aaron, thi brother, of the lynage of Leuy, is eloquent; lo! he schal go out in to thi comyng, and he schal se thee, and schal be glad in herte. 
\v 15 Speke thou to hym, and putte thou my wordis in his mouth, and Y schal be in thi mouth, and in the mouth of hym; and Y schal schewe to you what ye owen to do. 
\v 16 He schal speke for thee to the puple, and he schal be thi mouth; forsothe thou schalt be to him in these thingis, that perteynen to God. 
\v 17 Also take thou this yerde in thin hond, in which thou schalt do myraclis. 
\v 18 Moises yede, and turnede ayen to Jetro, his wyues fadir, and seide to hym, Y schal go, and turne ayen to my britheren in to Egipt, that Y se, whether thei lyuen yit. To whom Jetro seide, Go thou in pees. 
\v 19 Therfor the Lord seide to Moyses in Madian, Go thou, and turne ayen into Egipt; for alle thei ben deed that souyten thi lijf. 
\v 20 Moises took his wijf, and hise sones, and puttide hem on an asse, and he turnede ayen in to Egipt, and bar the yerde of God in his hond. 
\v 21 And the Lord seide to hym turnynge ayen in to Egipt, Se, that thou do alle wondris, whiche Y haue put in thin hond, bifore Farao; Y schal make hard \f + \fr 4:21  \ft  I shal make harde, that is, I shal suffre that his herte be maad hard. The glose here. God is not cause of the hardynge of herte in as miche as it is synne, for so it is of fre wille; but God is cause of hardynge of the herte in as miche as it is peyne, for in peyne of synne don bifore he withdrawith grace, to whiche grace it perteyneth to maken neisshe the herte; and therefor whan grace is withdrawe, mannis herte is maad hard in his euyl. \f* his herte, and he schal not delyuere the puple; and thou schalt seie to hym, 
\v 22 The Lord seith these thingis, My firste gendrid sone is Israel; 
\v 23 Y seide to thee, delyuere thou my sone, that he serue me, and thou noldist delyuere hym; lo! Y schal sle thi firste gendrid sone. 
\v 24 And whanne Moises was in the weie, in an yn, the Lord cam to him, and wolde sle hym. 
\v 25 Sefora took anoon a moost scharp stoon, and circumcidide the yerde of hir sone; and sche towchide `the feet of Moises, and seide, Thou art an hosebonde of bloodis to me. 
\v 26 And he lefte hym, aftir that sche hadde seid, Thou art an hosebonde of bloodis to me for circumcisioun. 
\v 27 Forsothe the Lord seide to Aaron, Go thou in to the comyng of Moises in to deseert; which yede ayens Moises in to the hil of God, and kisside him. 
\v 28 And Moises telde to Aaron alle the wordis of the Lord, for whiche he hadde sent Moises; and `he telde the myraclis, whiche the Lord hadde comaundid. 
\v 29 And thei camen togidere, and gaderiden alle the eldere men of the sones of Israel. 
\v 30 And Aaron spak alle the wordis, whiche the Lord hadde seid to Moises, and he dide the signes bifore the puple; 
\v 31 and the puple bileuede; and thei herden, that the Lord hadde visitid the sones of Israel, and that he hadde biholde the turment of hem; and thei worschipiden lowe. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 Aftir these thingis Moises and Aaron entriden, and seiden to Farao, The Lord God of Israel seith these thingis, Delyuere thou my puple, that it make sacrifice to me in deseert. 
\v 2 And he answeride, Who is the Lord, that Y here his vois, and delyuere Israel? I knowe not the Lord, and Y schal not delyuere Israel. 
\v 3 Thei seiden, God of Ebrews clepide vs, that we go the weie of thre daies in to wildirnesse, and that we make sacrifice to oure Lord God, lest perauenture pestilence, ether swerd, bifalle to vs. 
\v 4 The kyng of Egipt seide to hem, Moises and Aaron, whi stiren ye the puple fro her werkis? Go ye to youre chargis. 
\v 5 And Farao seide, The puple of the loond is myche; ye seen that the cumpany hath encreessid; hou myche more schal it encreesse, if ye schulen yyue to hem reste fro werkis. 
\v 6 Therfor Farao comaundide in that dai to the maistris of werkis, and to rente gadereris of the puple, 
\v 7 and seide, Ye schulen no more yyue stre to the puple, to make tijl stoonys as bifore; but go thei, and gedere stobil; 
\v 8 and ye schulen sette on hem the mesure of tijl stoonys, which thei maden bifore, nether ye schulen abate ony thing; for thei ben idil, and therfor thei crien, and seien, Go we, and make we sacrifice to oure God; 
\v 9 be thei oppressid bi werkis, and fille thei tho, that thei assente not to the false wordis. 
\v 10 Therfor the maistris of the workis and the rente gadereris yeden out to the puple, and seiden, Thus seith Farao, Y yyue not to you stre; 
\v 11 go ye, and gadere, if ye moun fynde ony where; nether ony thing schal be decreessid of youre werk. 
\v 12 And the puple was scaterid bi al the lond of Egipt to gadre stre. 
\v 13 And the maystris of werkis weren bisi, and seiden, Fille ye youre werk ech dai, as ye weren wont to do, whanne the stre was youun to you. 
\v 14 And thei, that weren maistris of the werkis of the sones of Israel, weren betun of the rent gadereris of Farao, that seiden, Whi filliden ye not the mesure of tijl stoonus, as bifore, nether yistirdai nethir to dai? 
\v 15 And the souereyns of the sonys of Israel camen, and crieden to Farao, and seiden, Whi doist thou so ayens thi seruauntis? 
\v 16 Stre is not youun to vs, and tijl stoonus ben comaundid in lijk manere. Lo! we thi seruauntis ben betun with scourgis, and it is doon vniustli ayens thi puple. 
\v 17 Farao seide, Ye yyuen tent to idilnesse, and therfor ye seien, Go we, and make we sacrifice to the Lord; 
\v 18 therfor go ye, and worche; stre schal not be youun to you, and ye schulen yelde the customable noumbre of tijl stoonus. 
\v 19 And the souereyns of the children of Israel sien hem silf in yuel, for it was seid to hem, No thing schal be decreessid of tijl stoonus bi alle daies. 
\v 20 And thei `camen to Moises and Aaron, that stoden euene ayens, and thei `yeden out fro Farao, 
\v 21 and seiden to `Moises and Aaron, The Lord se, and deme, for ye han maad oure odour to stynke bifore Farao and hise seruauntis; and ye han youe to hym a swerd, that he schulde sle vs. 
\v 22 And Moises turnede ayen to the Lord, and seide, Lord, whi hast thou turmentid this puple? why sentist thou me? 
\v 23 For sithen Y entride to Farao, that Y schulde speke in thi name, thou hast turmentid thi puple, and hast not delyuered hem. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord seide to Moises, Now thou schalt se, what thingis Y schal do to Farao; for bi strong hond he schal delyuere hem, and in myyti hond he schal caste hem out of his lond. 
\v 2 And the Lord spak to Moises, 
\v 3 and seide, Y am the Lord, that apperide to Abraham, and to Isaac, and to Jacob in Almyyti God; and Y schewide not to hem my greet name Adonai \f + \fr 6:3  \ft  Adonay, that is, tetragramaton, that signefieth Goddis beyng nakidly, without consideracioun to creature. \f* ; 
\v 4 and Y made couenaunt with hem, that Y schulde yyue to hem the lond of Canaan, the lond of her pilgrymage, in which thei weren comelyngis. 
\v 5 Y herde the weilyng of the sones of Israel, in which the Egipcians oppresseden hem, and Y hadde mynde of my couenaunt. 
\v 6 Therfor seie thou to the sones of Israel, Y am the Lord, that schal lede out you of the prisoun of Egipcians; and Y schal delyuere fro seruage; and Y schal ayen bie in `an hiy arm, and in grete domes; 
\v 7 and Y schal take you to me in to a puple, and Y schal be youre God; and ye schulen wite, for Y am youre Lord God, `which haue led you out of the prisoun of Egipcians, 
\v 8 and haue led you in to the lond, on which Y reiside myn hond, that Y schulde yyue it to Abraham, and to Ysaac, and to Jacob; and Y schal yyue to you that lond to be weldid; I the Lord. 
\v 9 Therfor Moises telde alle thingis to the sones of Irael, whiche assentide not to hym for the angwisch of spirit, and for the hardest werk. 
\v 10 And the Lord spak to Moises, 
\v 11 and seide, Entre thou, and speke to Farao, kyng of Egipt, that he delyuere the children of Israel fro his lond. 
\v 12 Moises answeride bifore the Lord, Lo! the children of Israel here not me, and hou schal Farao here, moost sithen Y am vncircumcidid in lippis? 
\v 13 And the Lord spak to Moises and to Aaron, and yaf comaundementis to the sones of Israel, and to Farao, kyng of Egipt, that thei schulden lede out the sones of Israel fro the lond of Egipt. 
\v 14 These ben the princis of housis bi her meynees. The sones of Ruben, the firste gendrid of Israel, Enoch, and Fallu, Esrom, and Charmy; these ben the kynredis of Ruben. 
\v 15 The sones of Symeon, Jamuel, and Jamyn, and Aod, and Jachym, and Soer, and Saul, the sone of a womman of Canaan; these ben the kynretis of Symeon. 
\v 16 And these ben the names of the sones of Leuy by her kynredis, Gerson, and Caath, and Merary. Forsothe the yeeris of lijf of Leuy weren an hundrid and seuene and thretti. 
\v 17 The sones of Gerson, Lobny and Semei, bi her kynredis. 
\v 18 The sones of Caath, Amram, and Isuar, and Hebron, and Oziel; and the yeeris of lijf of Caath weren an hundrid and thre and thretti. 
\v 19 The sones of Merari weren Mooli and Musi. These weren the kynredis of Leuy bi her meynees. 
\v 20 Forsothe Amram took a wijf, Jocabed, douytir of his fadris brother, and sche childide to hym Aaron, and Moises, and Marie; and the yeeris of lijf of Amram weren an hundred and seuene and thretti. 
\v 21 Also the sones of Isuar weren Chore, and Nafeg, and Zechry. 
\v 22 Also the sones of Oziel weren Misael, and Elisaphan, and Sechery. 
\v 23 Sotheli Aaron took a wijf, Elizabeth, the douytir of Amynadab, the sistir of Naason, and sche childide to hym Nadab, and Abyu, and Eleazar, and Ythamar. 
\v 24 Also the sones of Chore weren Aser, and Elcana, and Abiasab; thes weren the kinredis of Chore. 
\v 25 And sotheli Eleazar, sone of Aaron, took a wijf of the douytris of Phatiel, and sche childide Fynees to hym. These ben the princis of the meynees of Leuy bi her kynredis. 
\v 26 This is Aaron and Moises, to whiche the Lord comaundide, that thei schulden lede out of the lond of Egipt the sones of Israel by her cumpanyes; 
\v 27 these it ben, that speken to Pharao king of Egipt, that thei lede the sones of Israel out of Egipt; 
\v 28 this is Moises and Aaron, in the dai in which the Lord spak to Moises in the lond of Egipt. 
\v 29 And the Lord spak to Moises, and seide, Y am the Lord; spek thou to Farao, kyng of Egipt, alle thingis whiche Y speke to thee. 
\v 30 And Moises seide bifore the Lord, Lo! Y am vncircumcidid in lippis; hou schal Farao here me? 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord seide to Moises, Lo! Y haue maad thee the god of Farao; and Aaron, thi brother, schal be thi prophete. 
\v 2 Thou schalt speke to Aaron alle thingis whiche Y comaunde to thee, and he schal speke to Farao, that he delyuere the sones of Israel fro his hond. 
\v 3 But Y schal make hard his herte, and Y schal multiplie my signes and merueils in the lond of Egipt, and he schal not here you; 
\v 4 and Y schal sende myn hond on Egipt, and Y schal lede out myn oost, and my puple, the sones of Israel, fro the lond of Egipt bi mooste domes; 
\v 5 and Egipcians schulen wite, that Y am the Lord, which haue holde forth myn hond on Egipt, and haue led out of the myddis of hem the sones of Israel. 
\v 6 And so Moises dide and Aaron; as the Lord comaundide, so thei diden. 
\v 7 Forsothe Moyses was of fourescoor yeer, and Aaron was of fourescoor yeer and thre, whanne thei spaken to Farao. 
\v 8 And the Lord seide to Moises and to Aaron, 
\v 9 Whanne Farao schal seie to you, Schewe ye signes to vs, thou schalt seie to Aaron, Take thi yerde, and caste forth it before Farao, and be it turned into a serpent. 
\v 10 And so Moises and Aaron entriden to Farao, and diden as the Lord comaundide; and Aaron took the yeerde, and castide forth bifore Farao and hise seruauntis, which yerde was turned in to a serpent. 
\v 11 Forsothe Farao clepide wise men, and witchis, and thei also diden bi enchauntementis of Egipt, and bi summe priuy thingis in lijk maner; 
\v 12 and alle castiden forth her yerdis, whiche weren turned in to dragouns; but the yerde of Aaron deuouride `the yerdis of hem. 
\v 13 And the herte of Farao was maad hard, and he herde not hem, as the Lord comaundide. 
\v 14 Forsothe the Lord seide to Moyses, The herte of Farao is maad greuouse, he nyle delyuere the puple; 
\v 15 go thou to hym eerli; lo! he schal go out to the watris, and thou schalt stonde in the comyng of hym on the brynke of the flood; and thou schalt take in thin honde the yerde, that was turned into a dragoun, 
\v 16 and thou schalt seie to hym, The Lord God of Ebrews sente me to thee, and seide, Delyuere thou my puple, that it make sacrifice to me in desert; til to present time thou noldist here. 
\v 17 Therfor the Lord seith these thingis, In this thou schalt wite, that Y am the Lord; lo! Y schal smyte with the yerde, which is in myn hond, the watir of the flood, and it schal be turned in to blood; 
\v 18 and the fischis that ben in the flood schulen die; and the watris schulen wexe rotun, and Egipcians drynkynge the watir of the flood schulen be turmentid. 
\v 19 Also the Lord seide to Moises, Seie thou to Aaron, Take thi yerde, and holde forth thin hond on the watris of Egipt, and on the flodis of hem, and on the stremys `of hem, and on the mareis, and alle lakis of watris, that tho be turned in to blood; and blood be in al the lond of Egipt, as wel in vessils of tree as of stoon. 
\v 20 And Moises and Aaron diden so, as the Lord comaundide; and Aaron reiside the yerde, and smoot the watir of the flood bifore Farao and hise seruauntis, which watir was turned in to blood; 
\v 21 and fischis, that weren in the flood, dieden; and the flood was rotun, and Egipcians myyten not drynke the water of the flood; and blood was in al the lond of Egipt. 
\v 22 And the witchis of Egipcians diden in lijk maner by her enchauntementis; and the herte of Farao was maad hard, and he herde not hem, as the Lord comaundide. 
\v 23 And he turnede awei hym silf, and entride in to his hows, nethir he took it to herte, yhe, in this tyme. 
\v 24 Forsothe alle Egipcians diggiden watir `bi the cumpas of the flood, to drinke; for thei myyten not drynke of the `watir of the flood. 
\v 25 And seuene daies weren fillid, aftir that the Lord smoot the flood. 
\c 8

\v 1 Also the Lord seide to Moises, Entre thou to Farao, and thou schalt seie to hym, The Lord seith these thingis, Delyuere thou my puple, that it make sacrifice to me; sotheli if thou nylt delyuere, lo! 
\v 2 Y schal smyte alle thi termys with paddoks; 
\v 3 and the flood schal buyle out paddokis, that schulen stie, and schulen entre in to thin hows, and in to the closet of thi bed, and on thi bed, and in to `the hous of thi seruauntis, and in to thi puple, and in to thin ouenes, and in to the relyues of thi metis; 
\v 4 and the paddoks schulen entre to thee, and to thi puple, and to alle thi seruauntis. 
\v 5 And the Lord seide to Moises, Seie thou to Aaron, Hold forth thin hond on the floodis, and on the streemes, and mareis; and bryng out paddoks on the lond of Egipt. 
\v 6 And Aaron helde forth the hond on the watris of Egipt; and paddoks stieden, and hileden the lond of Egipt. 
\v 7 Forsothe and the witchis diden in lijk maner bi her enchauntementis; and thei brouyten forth paddoks on the lond of Egipt. 
\v 8 Forsothe Farao clepide Moises and Aaron, and seide to hem, Preie ye the Lord, that he do a wei the paddoks fro me, and fro my puple; and Y schal delyuere the puple, that it make sacrifice to the Lord. 
\v 9 And Moises seide to Farao, Ordeyne thou a tyme to me, whanne Y schal preie for thee, and for thi seruauntis, and for thi puple, that the paddokis be dryuun awei fro thee, and fro thin hows, and fro thi seruauntis, and fro thi puple; and dwelle oneli in the flood. 
\v 10 And he answeride, To morewe. And Moises seide, Y schal do bi thi word, that thou wite, that noon is as oure Lord God; and the paddoks schulen go awei fro thee, 
\v 11 and fro thin hous, and fro thi children, and fro thi seruauntis, and fro thi puple; and tho schulen dwelle oneli in the flood. 
\v 12 And Moises and Aaron yeden out fro Farao. And Moises criede to the Lord, for the biheest of paddoks, which he hadde seid to Farao. 
\v 13 And the Lord dide bi the word of Moises; and the paddoks weren deed fro housis, and fro townes, and fro feeldis; 
\v 14 and thei gaderiden tho in to grete heepis, and the lond was rotun. 
\v 15 Sotheli Farao seiy that reste was youun, and he made greuous his herte, and herde not hem, as the Lord comaundide. 
\v 16 And the Lord seide to Moises, Spek thou to Aaron, Holde forth thi yerde, and smyte the dust of erthe, and litle flies, ether gnattis, be in al the lond of Egipt. 
\v 17 And thei diden so; and Aaron helde forth the hond, and helde the yerde, and smoot the duste of erthe; and gnattis weren maad in men, and in werk beestis; al the dust of erthe was turned in to gnattis bi al the lond of Egipt. 
\v 18 And witchis diden in lijk maner bi her enchauntementis, that thei schulden brynge forth gnattis, and thei miyten not; and gnattis weren as wel in men as in werk beestis. 
\v 19 And the witchis seiden to Farao, This is the fyngur of God. And the herte of Farao was maad hard, and he herde not hem, as the Lord comaundide. 
\v 20 And the Lord seide to Moises, Rise thou eerli, and stonde bifore Farao, for he schal go out to the watris; and thou schalt seie to hym, The Lord seith these thingis, Delyuere thou my puple, that it make sacrifice to me; 
\v 21 that if thou schalt not delyuere the puple, lo! Y schal sende in to thee, and in to thi seruauntis, and in to thi puple, and in to thin housis, al the kynde of flies \f + \fr 8:21  \ft  In Ebru that is a medlynge, and signifyeth diuerse beestis. \f* ; and the housis of Egipcians schulen be fillid with flies of dyuerse kyndis, and al the lond in which thei schulen be. 
\v 22 And in that dai Y schal make wondurful the lond of Gessen, in which my puple is, that flies be not there; and that thou wite that Y am the Lord in the myddis of erthe; 
\v 23 and Y schal sette departyng bitwixe my puple and thi puple; this signe schal be to morewe. 
\v 24 And the Lord dide so. And a moost greuouse flie cam in to the hows of Farao, and of hise seruauntis, and in to al the lond of Egipt; and the lond was corrupt of siche flies. 
\v 25 And Farao clepide Moises and Aaron, and seide to hem, Go ye, make ye sacrifice to `youre Lord God in this lond. 
\v 26 And Moises seide, It may not be so, for `we schulen offre to oure God the abhomynaciouns of Egipcians; that if we schulen sle bifore Egipcians tho thingis whiche thei worschipen, thei schulen `ouerleie vs with stoonus. 
\v 27 We schulen go the weie of thre daies in to wildirnesse, and we schulen make sacrifice to oure Lord God, as he comaundide vs. 
\v 28 And Farao seide, Y schal delyuere you, that ye make sacrifice to `youre Lord God in deseert; netheles go ye not ferthere; preie ye for me. 
\v 29 And Moises seide, Y schal go out fro thee, and Y schal preie the Lord; and the fli schal go awei fro Farao, and fro hise seruauntis, and puple to morewe; netheles nyle thou more disseyue me, that thou delyuere not the puple to make sacrifice to the Lord. 
\v 30 And Moises yede out fro Farao, and preiede the Lord, whiche dide bi the word of Moyses, 
\v 31 and took awei flies fro Farao, and fro hise seruauntis, and puple; noon lefte, `sotheli nether oon. 
\v 32 And the herte of Farao was maad hard, so that he delyueride not the puple, sothli nethir in this tyme. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 Forsothe the Lord seide to Moises, Entre thou to Farao, and speke thou to hym, The Lord God of Ebrews seith these thingis, Delyuere thou my puple, that it make sacrifice to me; 
\v 2 that if thou forsakist yit, and withholdist hem, lo! 
\v 3 myn hond schal be on thi feeldis, on horsis, and assis, and camels, and oxun, and scheep, a pestilence ful greuous; 
\v 4 and the Lord schal make a merueilous thing bitwixe the possessiouns of Israel and the possessiouns of Egipcians, that outirli no thing perische of these thingis that perteynen to the sones of Israel. 
\v 5 And the Lord ordeinede a tyme, and seide, To morewe the Lord schal do this word in the lond. 
\v 6 Therfor the Lord made this word in the tother dai, and alle the lyuynge beestis of Egipcians weren deed; forsothe outirli no thing perischide of the beestis of the sones of Israel. 
\v 7 And Farao sente to se, nether ony thing was deed of these thingis whiche Israel weldide; and the herte of Farao was maad greuouse, and he delyuerede not the puple. 
\v 8 And the Lord seide to Moises and Aaron, Take ye the hondis ful of askis of the chymeney, and Moises sprynge it in to heuene bifore Farao; 
\v 9 and be there dust on al the lond of Egipt; for whi botchis schulen be in men and in werk beestis, and bolnynge bladdris schulen be in al the lond of Egipt. 
\v 10 And thei token askis \f + \fr 9:10  \ft  askis of the chemeney, in Ebreu it is of the brennynge chymeney, that is, brennynge aische. \f* of the chymney, and stoden bifore Farao; and Moises spreynt it into heuene; and woundis of bolnynge bladdris weren maad in men, and in werk beestis; 
\v 11 and the witchis myyten not stonde bifor Moises, for woundis that weren in hem, and in al the lond of Egipt. 
\v 12 And the Lord made hard the herte of Farao, and he herde not hem, as the Lord spak to Moises. 
\v 13 Also the Lord seide to Moises, Rise thou eerli, and stonde bifore Farao, and thou schalt seie to hym, The Lord God of Ebrews seth these thingis, Delyuere thou my puple, that it make sacrifice to me; 
\v 14 for in this tyme Y schal sende alle my veniauncis on thin herte, and on thi seruauntis, and on thi puple, that thou wite, that noon is lijk me in al erthe. 
\v 15 For now Y schal holde forth the hond, and Y schal smyte thee and thi puple with pestilence, and thou schalt perische fro erthe; 
\v 16 forsothe herfor Y haue set thee, that Y schewe my strengthe in thee, and that my name be teld in ech lond. 
\v 17 Yit thou withholdist my puple, and nylt delyuere it? 
\v 18 Lo! to morewe in this same our Y schal reyne ful myche hail, which maner hail was not in Egipt, fro the dai in which it was foundid, til in to present tyme. 
\v 19 Therfor sende thou `riyt now, and gadere thi werk beestis, and alle thingis whiche thou hast in the feeld; for men and werk beestis and alle thingis that ben in feeldis with outforth, and ben not gaderid fro the feeldis, and haile falle on tho, schulen die. 
\v 20 He that dredde `the Lordis word, of the seruauntis of Farao, made his seruauntis and werk beestis fle in to housis; 
\v 21 sotheli he that dispiside the `Lordis word, lefte his seruauntis and werk beestis in the feeldis. 
\v 22 And the Lord seide to Moises, Holde forth thin hond in to heuene, that hail be maad in al the lond of Egipt, on men, and on werk beestis, and on ech eerbe of the feeld in the lond of Egipt. 
\v 23 And Moises held forth the yerde in to heuene; and the Lord yaf thundris, and hail, and leitis rennynge aboute on the lond; and the Lord reynede hail on the lond of Egipt; 
\v 24 and hail and fier meddlid togidere weren borun forth; and it was of so myche greetnesse, how greet apperide neuere bifore in al the lond of Egipt, sithen thilke puple was maad. 
\v 25 And the hail smoot in the lond of Egipt alle thingis that weren in the feeldis, fro man til to werk beeste; and the hail smoot al the eerbe of the feeld, and brak al the flex of the cuntrey; 
\v 26 oonli the hail felde not in the lond of Gessen, where the sones of Israel weren. 
\v 27 And Farao sente, and clepide Moises and Aaron, and seide to hem, Y haue synned also now; the Lord is iust, Y and my puple ben wickid; 
\v 28 preye ye the Lord, that the thundris and hail of God ceesse, and Y schal delyuere you, and dwelle ye no more here. 
\v 29 Moyses seide, Whanne Y schal go out of the citee, Y schal holde forth myn hondis to the Lord, and leitis and thundris schulen ceesse, and hail schal not be, that thou wite, that the lond is the Lordis; 
\v 30 forsothe Y knowe, that thou and thi seruauntis dreden not yit the Lord. 
\v 31 Therfor the flex and barli was hirt, for the barli was greene, and the flex hadde buriounned thanne knoppis; 
\v 32 forsothe wheete and beenys weren not hirt, for tho weren late. 
\v 33 And Moyses yede out fro Farao, and fro the citee, and helde forth the hondis to the Lord, and thundris and hail ceessiden, and reyn droppide no more on the erthe. 
\v 34 Sotheli Farao siy that the reyn hadde ceessid, and the hail, and thundris, and he encreesside synne; 
\v 35 and the herte of hym and of hise seruauntis was maad greuouse, and his herte was maad hard greetli; nethir he lefte the sones of Israel, as the Lord comaundide bi `the hond of Moises. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord seide to Moises, Entre thou to Farao, for Y haue maad hard the herte of hym, and of hise seruauntis, that Y do these signes `of me in hym; 
\v 2 and that thou telle in the eeris of thi sone and of `thi sones sones, how ofte Y al to-brak Egipcians, and dide signes in hem; and that ye wyte that Y am the Lord. 
\v 3 Therfore Moises and Aaron entriden to Farao, and seiden to hym, The Lord God of Ebrews seith these thingis, How long `nylt thou be maad suget to me? Delyuere thou my puple, that it make sacrifice to me; ellis sotheli if thou ayenstondist, 
\v 4 and nylt delyuere it, lo! Y schal brynge in to morewe a locuste in to thi coostis, 
\v 5 which schal hile the hiyere part of erthe, nether ony thing therof schal appere, but that, that was `residue to the hail schal be etun; for it schal gnawe alle the trees that buriounnen in feeldis; 
\v 6 and tho schulen fille thin howsis, and the howsis of thi seruauntis, and of alle Egipcians, hou greet thi fadris and grauntsiris sien not, sithen thei weren borun on erthe, til in to present dai. And Moises turnede awei hym silf, and yede out fro Farao. 
\v 7 Forsothe the seruauntis of Farao seiden to hym, Hou longe schulen we suffre this sclaundre? Delyuere the men, that thei make sacrifice to `her Lord God; seest thou not that Egipt perischide? 
\v 8 And thei ayen clepiden Moises and Aaron to Farao, and he seide to hem, Go ye, and make ye sacrifice to `youre Lord God; whiche ben thei, that schulen go? 
\v 9 Moises seide, We schulen go with oure litle children and eldre, and with sones, and douytris, with scheep, and grete beestis; for it is the solempnyte of `oure Lord God. 
\v 10 And Farao answeride, So the Lord be with you \f + \fr 10:10  \ft  So the Lord be with you. He seide this in scorn, vndurstondinge the contrarie. \f* ; hou therfor schal Y delyuere you and youre litle children? to whom is it doute, that ye thenken worst? 
\v 11 It schal `not be so; but go ye men oneli, and make ye sacrifice to the Lord; for also ye axiden this. And anoon thei weren cast out fro the siyt of Farao. 
\v 12 Forsothe the Lord seide to Moises, Holde forth thi hond on the lond of Egipt, to a locust, that it stie on the lond, and deuoure al the eerbe which is residue to the hail. 
\v 13 And Moises helde forthe the yerde on the lond of Egipt, and the Lord brouyte in a brennynge wynd al that dai and niyt; and whanne the morewtid was maad, the brennynge wynd reiside locustis, whiche stieden on al the lond of Egipt, 
\v 14 and saten in alle the coostis of Egipcians; `and the locustis weren vnnoumbrable, and suche weren not bifore that tyme, nether schulen come aftirward. 
\v 15 And tho hiliden al the face of the erthe, and wastiden alle thingis; therfor the eerbe of the erthe was deuourid, and what euere of applis was in trees, whiche the hail hadde left, `it was deuourid; and outirli no green thing was left in trees and in eerbis of erthe, in al Egipt. 
\v 16 Wherfor Farao hastide, and clepide Moises and Aaron, and seide to hem, Y haue synned ayens youre Lord God, and ayens yow; 
\v 17 but now foryyue ye the synne to me; also in this tyme preie ye youre Lord God, that he take awey fro me this deeth. 
\v 18 And Moises yede out of the siyt of Farao, and preiede the Lord; 
\v 19 which made a moost strong wynd to blowe fro the west, and took, and castide the locust in to the reed see; `noon dwellide, sotheli nether oon, in alle the coostis of Egipt. 
\v 20 And the Lord made hard the herte of Farao, and he lefte not the sones of Israel. 
\v 21 Forsothe the Lord seide to Moises, Holde forth thin hond in to heuene, and derknessis be on the lond of Egipt, so thicke that tho moun be gropid. 
\v 22 And Moises helde forth the hond in to heuene, and orrible derknessis weren maad in al the lond of Egipt; 
\v 23 in thre daies no man seiy his brother, nether mouede him silf fro that place in which he was. Whereuer the sones of Israel dwelliden, liyt was. 
\v 24 And Farao clepide Moises and Aaron, and seide to hem, Go ye, make ye sacrifice to the Lord; oneli youre scheep and grete beestis dwelle stille; youre litle children go with you. 
\v 25 Moises seide, Also thou schalt yyue \f + \fr 10:25  \ft Note: also thou schalt yyue, &c. that is, thou schalt suffre that we lede beestis to sacrifices.\f* to vs offryngis and brent sacrifices, whiche we schulen offre to `oure Lord God;

\v 27 Forsothe the Lord made hard the herte of Farao, and he nolde delyuere hem. 
\v 28 And Farao seide to Moises, Go awei fro me, and be war that thou se no more my face; in whateuer dai thou schalt appere to me, thou schalt die. 
\v 29 Moyses answeride, Be it doon so, as thou hast spokun; I schal no more se thi face. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord seide to Moises, Yit Y schal touche Farao and Egipt with o veniaunce, and after these thingis he schal delyuere you, and schal constreyne you to go out. 
\v 2 Therfor thou schalt seie to al the puple, that a man axe of his freend, and a womman of hir neiyboresse, silueren vessels and goldun, and clothis; 
\v 3 forsothe the Lord schal yyue grace to his puple bifor Egipcians. And Moises was a ful greet man in the lond of Egipt, bifore the seruauntis of Farao and al the puple; 
\v 4 and he seide, The Lord seith these thingis, At mydnyyt Y schal entre in to Egipt; 
\v 5 and ech firste gendrid thing in the lond of Egipcians schal die, fro the firste gendrid of Farao, that sittith in the trone of hym, til to the firste gendrid of the handmayde, which is at the querne; and alle the firste gendrid of beestis schulen die; 
\v 6 and greet cry schal be in al the lond of Egipt, which maner cry was not bifore, nether schal be aftirward. 
\v 7 Forsothe at alle the children of Israel a dogge schal not make priuy noise, fro man til to beeste; that ye wite bi how greet myracle the Lord departith Egipcians and Israel. 
\v 8 And alle these thi seruauntis schulen come doun to me, and thei schulen preye me, and schulen seie, Go out thou, and al the puple which is suget to thee; aftir these thingis we schulen go out. 
\v 9 And Moyses was ful wrooth, and yede out fro Farao. Forsothe the Lord seide to Moises, Farao schal not here you, that many signes be maad in the lond of Egipt. 
\v 10 Sotheli Moises and Aaron maden alle signes and wondris, that ben writun, bifor Farao; and the Lord made hard the herte of Farao, nether he delyuerede the sones of Israel fro his lond. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 Also the Lord seide to Moises and Aaron in the lond of Egipt, 
\v 2 This monethe, the bigynnyng of monethis to you, schal be the firste in the monethis of the yeer. 
\v 3 Speke ye to al the cumpanye of the sones of Israel, and seie ye to hem, In the tenthe dai of this monethe ech man take a lomb by hise meynees and housis; 
\v 4 but if the noumbre is lesse, that it may not suffice to ete the lomb, he schal take his neiybore, which is ioyned to his hows, bi the noumbre of soulis, that moun suffice to the etyng of the lomb. 
\v 5 Forsothe the lomb schal be a male of o yeer, without wem; bi which custom ye schulen take also a kide \f + \fr 12:5  \ft  a kide, if a lomb may not be had in good maner. \f* ; 
\v 6 and ye schulen kepe hym til to the fouretenthe dai of this monethe; and al the multitude of the sones of Israel schal offre hym at euentid.\f + \fr 12:6  \ft  that is, ech hows of the multitude schal offre oon, if fewnesse of persoones lettith not. \f* 
\v 7 And thei schulen take of his blood, and schulen put on euer either post, and in lyntels, `ether hiyer threschfoldis, of the housis, in whiche thei schulen ete hym; 
\v 8 and in that niyt thei schulen ete fleischis, roostid with fier, and therf looues, with letusis \f + \fr 12:8  \ft  with letusis, in Ebrew it is with bitternessis. \f* of the feeld. 
\v 9 Ye schulen not ete therof ony raw thing, nether sodun in watir, but roostid oneli by fier; ye schulen deuoure the heed with feet and entrailis therof; 
\v 10 nether ony thing therof schal abide til the morewtid; if ony thing is residue, ye schulen brenne in the fier. 
\v 11 Forsothe thus ye schulen ete hym; ye schulen girde youre reynes, and ye schulen haue schoon in the feet, and ye schulen holde stauys in hondis, and ye schulen ete hastili; for it is fase, that is, the passyng of the Lord. 
\v 12 And Y schal passe thorou the lond of Egipt in that niyt, and Y schal smyte al the firste gendrid thing in the lond of Egipt, fro man til to beeste; and Y the Lord schal make domes in alle the goddis of Egipt. 
\v 13 Forsothe blood schal be to you in to signe, in the housis in whiche ye schulen be; and Y schal se the blood, and Y schal passe you; nether a wounde distriynge schal be in you, whanne Y schal smyte the lond of Egipt. 
\v 14 Forsothe ye schulen haue this dai in to mynde, and `ye schulen make it solempne to the Lord in youre generaciouns bi euerlastynge worschipyng. 
\v 15 In seuene daies ye schulen ete therf breed; in the firste dai no thing diyt with sour douy schal be in youre housis; who euer schal ete ony thing diyt with sour douy, fro the firste dai til the seuenthe dai, that soule schal perische fro Israel. 
\v 16 The firste day schal be hooli and solempne, and the seuenthe dai schal be worschipful bi the same halewyng; ye schulen not do ony werk in tho daies, outakun these thingis that perteynen to mete; 
\v 17 and ye schulen kepe therf breed. For in that same dai Y schal lede out of the lond of Egipt youre oost; and ye schulen kepe this dai in youre generaciouns bi euerlastynge custom. 
\v 18 In the first monethe, in the fouretenthe dai of the monethe, at euentid, ye schulen ete therf breed, til to the oon and twentithe dai of the same monethe at euentid. 
\v 19 In seuene dayes no thing `diyt with sour douy schal be foundun in youre housis; if ony etith ony thing diyt with sour dow, his soule schal perische fro the cumpeny of Israel, as wel of comelyngis, as of hem that ben borun in the lond. 
\v 20 Ye schulen not ete ony thing diyt with sour dow, and ye schulen ete therf breed in alle youre dwellyng placis. 
\v 21 Forsothe Moises clepide alle the eldre men of the sones of Israel, and seide to hem, Go ye, and take a beeste by youre meynees, and offre ye fase; and dippe ye a bundel of isope, 
\v 22 in the blood which `is in the threisfold, and sprynge ye therof the lyntel, and euer either post; noon of you schal go out at the dore of his hows til the morewtid. 
\v 23 For the Lord schal passe smytynge Egipcians; and whanne he schal se the blood in the lyntel, and in euer either post, he schal passe the dore of the hows; and he schal not suffre the smytere to entre in to youre housis, and to hirte. 
\v 24 Kepe thou this word; it schal be a lawful thing to thee and to thi sones til in to with outen ende. 
\v 25 And whanne ye schulen entre in to the lond which the Lord schal yyue to you, as he bihiyte, ye schulen kepe these cerymonyes; 
\v 26 and whanne youre sones schulen seie to you, What is this religioun? ye schulen seie to hem, 
\v 27 It is the sacrifice of the passyng of the Lord, whanne he passide ouer the housis of the sones of Israel in Egipt, and smoot Egipcians, and delyueride oure housis. And the puple was bowid, and worschipide. 
\v 28 And the sones of Israel yeden out, and diden as the Lord comaundide to Moises and to Aaron. 
\v 29 Forsothe it was doon in the myddis of the nyyt, the Lord smoot al the firste gendrid thing in the lond of Egipt, fro the firste gendrid of Farao, that sat in the trone of hym, til to the first gendrid of the caitif womman, that was in the prisoun, and alle the first gendrid of beestis. 
\v 30 And Farao roos in the nyyt, and alle hise seruauntis, and al Egipt; and a greet cry was maad in Egipt, for noon hows was, in which a deed man lay not. 
\v 31 And whanne Moises and Aaron weren clepid in the nyyt, Farao seide, Rise ye, go ye out fro my puple, bothe ye and the sones of Israel; go ye, offre ye to the Lord, as ye seien; 
\v 32 take ye youre scheep and greete beestis, as ye axiden; and go ye, and blesse ye me. 
\v 33 And Egipcians constreyneden the puple to go out of the lond swiftli, and seiden, All we schulen die! 
\v 34 Therfor the puple took meele spreynd togidere, bifor that it was diyt with sour douy; and boond in mentils, and puttide on her schuldris. 
\v 35 And the sones of Israel diden as the Lord comaundide to Moises; and thei axiden of Egipcians siluerne vesselis and goldun, and ful myche clooth. 
\v 36 Forsothe the Lord yaf grace to the puple bifor Egipcians, that the Egipcians lenten to hem; and thei maden bare Egipcians. 
\v 37 And the sones of Israel yeden forth fro Ramasses in to Socoth, almest sixe hundrid thousind of foot men, with out litle children and wymmen; 
\v 38 but also comyn puple of malis and femalis vnnoumbrable stieden with hem; scheep, and oxun, and ful many beestis of diuerse kynde, stieden with hem. 
\v 39 And thei bakiden meele, which spreynd to gidere `a while ago thei token fro Egipt, and maden therf looues bakun vnder the aischis; for the looues miyten not be diyt with sour dow, for Egipcians compelliden to go out, and suffriden not to make ony tariyng, nether it was leiser to make ony seew. 
\v 40 Forsothe the dwellyng of the sones of Israel, bi which thei dwelliden in Egipt, was of foure hundrid and thretti yeer \f + \fr 12:40  \ft  iiij. hundrid and xxx. yeer, rekenynge tho yeris in whiche they dwelliden as pilgryms in the loond of Canaan, and of Egipt, and of Filisteys. \f* ; 
\v 41 and whanne tho weren fillid, al the oost of the Lord yede out of the lond of Egipt in the same dai. 
\v 42 This nyyt is worthi to be kept in the worschipyng of the Lord, whanne he ladde hem out of the lond of Egipt; alle the sones of Israel owen to kepe this in her generaciouns. 
\v 43 Also the Lord seide to Moises and Aaron, This is the religioun of fase; ech alien schal not ete therof; 
\v 44 sotheli ech seruaunt bouyt schal be circumcidid, and so he schal ete; 
\v 45 a comelyng and hirid man \f + \fr 12:45  \ft  hirid man, that is, an hethen man out of the feith and obseruaunce of the Jewis, thouy he dwelle with hem for hire. \f* schulen not ete therof; 
\v 46 it schal be etun in oon hows; nether ye schulen bere out of the fleischis therof; nether ye schulen breke a boon therof. 
\v 47 Ech company of the sones of Israel schal make that fase; 
\v 48 that if ony pilgrym wole passe into youre feith and worschipyng, and make fase of the Lord, ech male kynde of hym schal be circumcidid bifore, and thanne he schal make lawfuli, and he schal be to gidere as a man borun of the lond; forsothe if ony man is not circumcidid, he schal not ete therof. 
\v 49 The same lawe schal be to a man borun of the lond, and to a comelyng, that takith youre feith, which is a pilgrym anentis you. 
\v 50 And alle the sones of Israel diden as the Lord comaundide to Moises and Aaron. 
\v 51 And in the same dai the Lord ladde out of `the lond of Egipt the sones of Israel, bi her cumpanies. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 Also the Lord spak to Moises, and seide, 
\v 2 Halewe thou to me ech firste gendrid thing that openeth the wombe among the sones of Israel, as wel of men as of beestis, for whi alle ben myn. 
\v 3 And Moises seide to the puple, Haue ye mynde of this dai, in which ye yeden out of Egipt, and of the hows of seruage, for in strong hond the Lord ledde you out of this place, that ye ete not breed diyt with sour dow. 
\v 4 To dai ye gon out, in the monethe of new fruytis; 
\v 5 and whanne the Lord hath led thee in to the lond of Cananey, and of Ethei, and of Amorrei, and of Euei, and of Jebusei, which lond he swoor to thi fadris, that he schulde yyue to thee, a lond flowynge with mylk and hony, thou schalt halowe this custom of holy thingis in this monethe. 
\v 6 In seuene daies thou schalt ete therf looues, and the solempnete of the Lord schal be in the seuenthe dai; 
\v 7 ye schulen ete therf looues seuene daies, no thing diyt with sour dow schal appere at thee, nether in alle thi coostis. 
\v 8 And thou schalt telle to thi sone in that dai, and schalt seie, This it is that the Lord dide to me, whanne Y yede out of Egipt. 
\v 9 And it schal be as a signe in thin hond, and as a memorial before thin iyen, and that the lawe of the Lord be euere in thi mouth; for in a strong hond the Lord ledde thee out of Egipt, and of the hows of seruage. 
\v 10 Thou schalt kepe siche a worschipyng in tyme ordeined, `fro daies in to daies. 
\v 11 And whanne the Lord hath brouyt thee in to the lond of Cananey, as he swoor to thee, and to thi fadris, and hath youe it to thee, 
\v 12 thou schalt departe to the Lord al the thing that openeth the wombe, and that that is the firste in thi beestis; what euer thing thou hast of male kynde, thou schalt halewe to the Lord. 
\v 13 Thou schalt chaunge the firste gendrid of an asse for a scheep, that if thou ayen biest not, thou schalt sle; forsothe thou schalt ayen bie with prijs al the firste gendrid of man of thi sones. 
\v 14 And whanne thi sone schal axe thee to morewe, and seie, What is this? thou schalt answere to hym, In a strong hond the Lord ladde vs out of the lond of Egipt, of the hows of seruage; for whanne Farao was maad hard, 
\v 15 and nolde delyuere vs, the Lord killide alle the firste gendrid thing in the lond of Egipt, fro the firste gendrid of man til to the firste gendrid of beestis; therfor Y offre to the Lord al thing of male kynde that openeth the wombe, and Y ayen bie alle the firste gendrid thingis of my sones. 
\v 16 Therfor it schal be as a signe in thin hond, and as a thing hangid for mynde bifore thin iyen, for in a strong hond the Lord ledde vs out of Egipt. 
\v 17 Therfor whanne Farao hadde sent out the puple, God ledde not hem out bi the weie of `the lond of Filisteis, which is niy; and arettid lest perauenture it wolde repente the puple, if he had seyn batelis rise ayens hym, and `the puple wolde turn ayen in to Egipt; 
\v 18 but God ledde aboute by the weie of deseert, which weie is bisidis the reed see. And the sones of Israel weren armed, and stieden fro the lond of Egipte. 
\v 19 And Moises took the boonus of Joseph with hym, for he hadde chargid the sones of Israel, and hadde seid, God schal visite you, and bere ye out `fro hennus my boonus with you. 
\v 20 And thei yeden forth fro Socoth, and settiden tentis in Etham, in the laste endis of wildirnesse. 
\v 21 Forsothe the Lord yede bifore hem to schewe the weie, bi dai in a piler of clowde, and bi nyyt in a piler of fier, that he schulde be ledere of the weie in euer either time; 
\v 22 the piler of clowde failide neuere bi dai, nether the piler of fier bi niyt, bifor the puple. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1 Forsothe the Lord spak to Moises, and seide, Speke thou to the sones of Israel; 
\v 2 turne thei ayen, and sette thei tentis euene ayens Fiayroth, which is bitwixe Magdalum and the see, ayens Beelsefon; in the siyt therof ye schulen sette tentis ouer the see. 
\v 3 And Farao schal seie on the sones of Israel, Thei ben maad streit in the lond, the deseert hath closid hem to gidere. 
\v 4 And Y schal make hard his herte, and he schal pursue you, and Y schal be glorified in Farao, and in al his oost; and Egipcians schulen wite that Y am the Lord; and thei diden so. 
\v 5 And it was teld to the kyng of Egipcians, that the puple hadde fled; and the herte of Farao and of hise seruauntis was chaungid on the puple, and thei seiden, What wolden we do, that we leften Israel, that it schulde not serue us? 
\v 6 Therfor Farao ioynede the chare, and took with him al his puple; 
\v 7 and he took sixe hundrid chosyn charis, and what euer thing of charis was in Egipt, and duykis of al the oost. 
\v 8 And the Lord made hard `the herte of Farao, kyng of Egipt, and he pursuede the sones of Israel; and thei weren go out in an hiy hond. 
\v 9 And whanne Egipcians pursueden the steppis of the sones of Israel bifor goynge, thei founden hem in tentis on the see; al the chyualrye and charis of Farao, and al the oost weren in Fiayroth, ayens Beelsefon. 
\v 10 And whanne Farao hadde neiyed the sones of Israel, reisiden her iyen, and thei sien Egipcians bihynde hem, and dredden greetli; and thei crieden to the Lord, 
\v 11 and seiden to Moises, In hap sepulcris weren not in Egipt, therfor thou hast take vs awei, that we schulen die in wildirnesse? what woldist thou do this, that thou leddist vs out of Egipt? 
\v 12 Whether this is not the word which we spaken to thee in Egipt, `and seiden, Go awei fro vs, that we serue Egipcians? for it is myche betere to serue hem, than to die in wildirnesse. 
\v 13 And Moises seide to the puple, Nyle ye drede, stonde ye, and `se ye the grete werkys of God, whiche he schal do to dai; for ye schulen no more se Egipcians, whiche ye seen now, til in to with outen ende; 
\v 14 the Lord schal fiyte for you, and ye schulen be stille. 
\v 15 And the Lord seide to Moises, What criest thou to me? Speke thou to the sones of Israel, that thei go forth; forsothe reise thou thi yerde, 
\v 16 and stretche forth thin hond on the see, and departe thou it, that the sones of Israel go in the myddis of the see, by drie place. 
\v 17 Forsothe Y schal make hard the herte of Egipcians, that thei pursue you, and Y schal be glorified in Farao, and in al the oost of hym, and in the charis, and in the knyytis of hym; 
\v 18 and Egipcians schulen wite that Y am the Lord God, whanne Y schal be glorified in Farao, and in the charis, and in the knyytis of hym. 
\v 19 And the aungel of the Lord, that yede bifore the castellis of Israel, took hym silf, and yede bihynde hem; and the piler of cloude yede to gidir with hym, and lefte the formere thingis aftir the bak, 
\v 20 and stood bitwixe the `castels of Egipcians and castels of Israel; and the cloude was derk toward Egipcians, and liytnynge `the nyyt toward `the children of Israel, so that in al the tyme of the niyt thei miyten not neiy togidere to hem silf. 
\v 21 And whanne Moises hadde stretchid forth the hond on the see, the Lord took it awei, the while a greet wynde and brennynge blew in al the niyt, and turnede in to dryenesse; and the watir was departid. 
\v 22 And the sones of Israel entriden by the myddis of the drye see; for the watir was as a wal at the riyt side and left side of hem. 
\v 23 And Egipcians pursueden, and entriden aftir hem, al the ridyng of Farao, hise charis, and knyytis, bi the myddis of the see. 
\v 24 And the wakyng of the morewtid cam thanne, and lo! the Lord bihelde on the castels of Egipcians, bi a piler of fier, and of cloude, and killide the oost of hem; and he destriede the wheelis of charis, 
\v 25 and tho weren borun in to the depthe. Therfor Egipcians seiden, Fle we Israel; for the Lord fiytith for hem ayenus vs. 
\v 26 And the Lord seide to Moises, Holde forth thin hond on the see, that the watris turne ayen to Egipcians, on the charis, and knyytis of hem. 
\v 27 And whanne Moises hadde hold forth the hoond ayens the see, it turnede ayen first in the morewtid to the formere place; and whanne Egipcians fledden, the watris camen ayen, and the Lord wlappide hem in the myddis of the floodis. 
\v 28 And the watris turneden ayen, and hiliden the charis, and knyytis of al the oost of Farao, which sueden, and entriden in to the see; sotheli not oon of hem was alyue. 
\v 29 Forsothe the sones of Israel yeden thorouy the myddis of the drye see, and the watris weren to hem as for a wal, on the riyt side and left side. 
\v 30 And in that dai the Lord delyuerede Israel fro the hond of Egipcians, and thei sien Egipcians deed on the brynke of the see, 
\v 31 and thei seiyen the greet hond which the Lord hadde vsid ayens hem; and the puple dredde the Lord, and thei bileueden to the Lord, and to Moises his seruaunt.

\v 1 Thanne Moises song, and the sones of Israel, this song to the Lord; and thei seiden, Synge we to the Lord, for he is magnefied gloriousli; he castide doun the hors and the stiere in to the see. 
\v 2 My strengthe and my preisyng is the Lord; and he is maad to me in to heelthe. This is my God, and Y schal glorifie hym; the God of my fadir, and Y schal enhaunse hym. 
\v 3 The Lord is as a man fiyter, his name is Almiyti; 
\v 4 he castide doun in to the see the charis of Farao, and his oost. Hise chosun princis weren drenchid in the reed see; 
\v 5 the depe watris hiliden hem; thei yeden doun in to the depthe as a stoon. 
\v 6 Lord, thi riythond is magnyfied in strengthe; Lord, thi riythond smoot the enemye. 
\v 7 And in the mychilnesse of thi glorie thou hast put doun alle myn \f + \fr 15:7  \ft  In Ebru it is thin aduersaries. \f* aduersaries; thou sentist thin ire, that deuouride hem as stobil. 
\v 8 And watris weren gaderid in the spirit of thi woodnesse; flowinge watir stood, depe watris weren gaderid in the middis of the see. 
\v 9 The enemy seide, Y schal pursue, and Y schal take; Y schal departe spuylis, my soule schal be fillid. I schal drawe out my swerde; myn hond schal sle hem. 
\v 10 Thi spirit blew, and the see hilide hem; thei weren drenchid as leed in grete watris. 
\v 11 Lord, who is lijk thee in stronge men, who is lijk thee? thou art greet doere in hoolynesse; ferdful, and preisable, and doynge myraclis. 
\v 12 Thou heldist forth thin hond, and the erthe deuouride hem; 
\v 13 thou were ledere in thi merci to thy puple, which thou ayen bouytist; and thou hast bore hym in thi strengthe to thin holi dwellyng place. 
\v 14 Puplis stieden, and weren wroothe; sorewis helden the dwelleris of Filistiym. 
\v 15 Thanne the pryncis of Edom weren disturblid; tremblyng held the stronge men of Moab. 
\v 16 Alle the dwelleris of Canaan `weren starke; inward drede falle on hem, and outward drede in the greetnesse of thin arm. Be thei maad vnmouable as a stoon, til thi puple passe, Lord; til this thi puple passe, whom thou weldidist. 
\v 17 Thou schalt brynge hem in, and thou schalt plaunte in the hil of thin eritage; in the moost stidefast dwellyng place which thou hast wrouyt, Lord; Lord, thi seyntuarie, which thin hondis made stidefast. 
\v 18 The Lord schal `regne in to the world and ferthere. 
\v 19 Forsothe Farao, `a ridere, entride with his charis and knyytis in to the see, and the Lord brouyte the watris of the se on hem; sotheli the sones of Israel yeden bi the drie place, in the myddis of the see. 
\v 20 Therfore Marie, profetesse, the `sistir of Aaron, took a tympan in hir hond, and alle the wymmen yeden out aftir hyr with tympans and cumpanyes; 
\v 21 to whiche sche song bifore, and seide, Synge we to the Lord, for he is magnyfied gloriousli; he castide doun in to the see the hors and the stiere of hym. 
\v 22 Forsothe Moises took Israel fro the reed see, and thei yeden out in to the deseert of Sur, and thei yeden thre daies bi the wildirnesse, and thei founden not watir. 
\v 23 And thei camen in to Marath, and thei miyten not drynk the watris of Marath, for tho weren bittere; wherfor and he puttide a couenable name to the place, and clepide it Mara, that is, bitternesse. 
\v 24 And the puple grutchide ayens Moises, and seide, What schulen we drynke? 
\v 25 And Moises criede to the Lord, which schewide to hym a tre; and whanne he hadde put that tre in to watris, tho weren turned in to swetnesse. There the Lord ordeynede comaundementis and domes to the puple, and there he asayede the puple, 
\v 26 and seide, If thou schalt here the vois of thi Lord God, and schalt do that that is riytful byfore hym, and schalt obeie to his comaundementis, and schalt kepe alle hise heestis, Y schal not brynge yn on thee al the syknesse, which Y puttide in Egipt, for Y am thi Lord Sauyour. 
\c 16

\v 1 Forsothe the sones of Israel camen in to Helym, where weren twelue wellis of watris, and seuenti palm trees, and thei settiden tentis bisidis the watris. And thei yeden forth fro Helym, and al the multitude of the sones of Israel cam in to deseert of Syn, which is bitwixe Helym and Synai, in the fiftenethe dai of the secunde monethe aftir that thei yeden out of the lond of Egipt. 
\v 2 And al the congregacioun of the sones of Israel grutchide ayens Moises, and ayens Aaron, in the wildirnesse. 
\v 3 And the sones of Israel seiden to hem, We wolden that we hadden be deed bi the `hoond of the Lord in the lond of Egipt, whanne we saten on the `pottis of fleisch, and eeten looues in plentee; whi leden ye vs in to this deseert, that ye schulden sle al the multitude with hungur? 
\v 4 Forsothe the Lord seide to Moises, Lo! Y schal reyne to you looues fro heuene; the puple go out, that it gadere tho thingis that sufficen bi ech day; that Y asaie the puple, whethir it goith in my lawe, ether nai. 
\v 5 Sotheli in the sixte dai make thei redi that that thei schulen bere yn, and be it double ouer that thei weren wont to gadere bi ech dai. 
\v 6 And Moises and Aaron seiden to alle the sones of Israel, At euentid ye schulen wite that the Lord ledde you out of the lond of Egipt; 
\v 7 and in the morewetid ye schulen se the glorie of the Lord; for Y herde youre grutchyng ayens the Lord; sotheli what ben we, for ye grutchen ayens us? 
\v 8 And Moises seide, The Lord schal yyue to you at euentid fleischis to ete, and looues in the morewetid in plentee, for he herde youre grutchyngis, bi which ye grutchiden ayens hym; for whi, what ben we? youre grutchyng is not ayens vs but ayens the Lord. 
\v 9 And Moises seide to Aaron, Seie thou to al the congregacioun of the sones of Israel, Neiye ye bifore the Lord, for he herde youre grutchyng. 
\v 10 And whanne Aaron spak to al the cumpeny of the sones of Israel, thei bihelden to the wildirnesse, and lo! the glorie of the Lord apperide in a cloude. 
\v 11 Forsothe the Lord spak to Moises, 
\v 12 and seide, Y herde the grutchyngis of the sones of Israel; spek thou to hem, At euentid ye schulen ete fleischis, and in the morewtid ye schulen be fillid with looues, and ye schulen wite that Y am `youre Lord God. 
\v 13 Therfor euentid was maad, and `curlewes stieden and hiliden the castels; and in the morewtid deew cam bi the face of the castels. 
\v 14 And whanne it hadde hilid the erthe, a litil thing, and as powned with a pestel, in the licnesse of an hoorfrost on erthe, apperide in the wildirnesse. 
\v 15 And whanne the sones of Israel hadden seyn that, thei seiden to gidere, Man hu? which signyfieth, what is this? for thei wisten not what it was. To whiche Moises seide, This is the breed, which the Lord hath youe to you to ete. 
\v 16 This is the word which the Lord comaundide, Ech man gadere therof as myche as suffisith to be etun, gomor bi ech heed, bi the noumbre of youre soulis that dwellen in the tabernacle, so ye schulen take. 
\v 17 And the sones of Israel diden so, and thei gaderiden oon more, another lesse; 
\v 18 and thei metiden at the mesure gomor; nethir he that gaderide more had more, nethir he that made redi lesse fond lesse, but alle gaderiden bi that that thei myyten ete. 
\v 19 And Moises seide to hem, Noon leeue therof in to the morewtid; whiche herden not him, 
\v 20 but summe of hem leften til to the morewtid, and it bigan to buyle with wormes, and it was rotun; and Moises was wrooth ayens hem. 
\v 21 Forsothe alle gaderiden in the morewtid as myche as `miyte suffice to be eten; and whanne the sunne was hoot, it was moltun. 
\v 22 Sotheli in the sixte dai thei gaderiden double metis, that is, `twei gomor by ech man. Forsothe alle the princis of the multitude camen, and telden to Moises, which seide to hem, 
\v 23 This it is that the Lord spak, The reste of the sabot is halewid to the Lord, do ye what euer thing schal be wrouyt to morewe, and sethe ye tho thingis that schulen be sodun; sotheli what euer thing is residue, kepe ye til in to the morewe. 
\v 24 And thei diden so as Moises comaundide, and it was not rotun, nether a worm was foundun ther ynne. 
\v 25 And Moises seide, Ete ye that in this dai, for it is the sabat of the Lord, it schal not be foundun to dai in the feeld; gadere ye in sixe daies, 
\v 26 forsothe the sabat of the Lord is in the seuenthe dai, therfor it schal not be foundun. 
\v 27 The seuenthe dai cam, and summe of the puple yeden out `to gadire, and thei founden not. 
\v 28 Forsothe the Lord seide to Moises, Hou long `nylen ye kepe my comaundementis, and my lawe? 
\v 29 Se ye that the Lord yaf to you the sabat, and for this he yaf to you in the sixte dai double meetis; ech man dwelle at him silf, noon go out of his place in the seuenthe dai. 
\v 30 And the puple kepte sabat in the seuenthe dai. 
\v 31 And the hous of Israel clepide the name therof man, which was whijt as the seed of coriandre, and the taast therof was as of flour with hony. 
\v 32 Forsothe Moises seide, This is the word which the Lord comaundide, Fille thou a gomor therof, and be it kept in to generaciouns to comynge aftirward, that thei knowe the breed bi which Y fedde you in the wildirnesse, whanne ye weren led out of the lond of Egipt. 
\v 33 And Moises seide to Aaron, Take thou o vessel, and putte therinne man, as myche as gomor mai take, and putte bifore the Lord, to be kept in to youre generaciouns, 
\v 34 as the Lord comaundide to Moises; and Aaron puttide that to be kept in the tabernacle. 
\v 35 Forsothe the sones of Israel eeten manna in fourti yeer, til thei camen in to the lond abitable; thei weren fed with this mete til thei touchiden the endis of the lond of Canaan. 
\v 36 Forsothe gomor is the tenthe part of efy.

\v 1 Therfor al the multitude of the sones of Israel yede forth fro the deseert of Syn, bi her dwellyngis, bi the word of the Lord, and settiden tentis in Rafidym, where was not watir to the puple to drynke. 
\v 2 Whiche puple chidde ayens Moises, and seide, Yyue thou water to vs, that we drynke. To whiche Moises answeride, What chiden ye ayens me, and whi tempten ye the Lord? 
\v 3 Therfor the puple thristide there for the scarsnesse of watir, and grutchiden ayens Moises, and seide, Whi madist thou vs to go out of Egipt, to sle vs, and oure fre children, and beestis, for thrist? 
\v 4 Forsothe Moises criede to the Lord, and seide, What schal Y do to this puple? yit a litil, also it schal stone me. 
\v 5 The Lord seide to Moises, Go thou bifore the puple, and take with thee of the eldre men of Israel, and take in thin hond the yerde, `bi which thou hast smyte the flood, and go; lo! 
\v 6 Y schal stonde there before thee, aboue the stoon of Oreb, and thou schalt smyte the stoon, and water schal go out therof, that the puple drynke. Moises dide so byfore the eldere men of Israel;

\v 9 And Jetro was glad on alle the goodis whiche the Lord hadde do to Israel, for he delyuerede Israel fro the hond of Egipcians. 
\v 10 And Jetro seide, Blessid be `the Lord, that delyuerede you fro the hond of Egipcians, and fro `the hond of Farao, which Lord delyuered his puple fro the hond of Egipt;

\v 3 Forsothe Moises stiede in to the hil to God; and the Lord clepide hym fro the mount, and seide, Thou schalt seie these thingis to the hows of Jacob, and thou schalt telle to the sones of Israel,

\v 13 Hondis schulen not touche hym, but he schal be oppressid with stoonus, ethir he shall be persid with dartis; whether it schal be a beest, ethir a man, it schal not lyue; whanne a clarioun schal bigynne to sowne, thanne `stie thei in to the hil. 
\v 14 And Moises cam doun fro the hil to the puple, and halewide it; and whanne thei hadden waischun her clothis,

\v 20 And he took the calf, which thei hadden maad, and brente, and brak `til to poudur, which he spreynte in to watir, and yaf therof drynke to the sones of Israel. 
\v 21 And Moises seide to Aaron, What dide this puple to thee, that thou brouytist in on hym the gretteste synne? 
\v 22 To whom he answeride, My lord, be not wrooth, for thou knowist this puple, that it is enclynaunt to yuel; 
\v 23 thei seiden to me, Make thou goddis to vs, that schulen go bifore vs, for we witen not, what bifelde to this Moises, that ladde vs out of the lond of Egipt. 
\v 24 To whiche Y seide, Who of you hath gold? Thei token, and yauen to me, and Y castide it forth in to the fier, and this calf yede out. 
\v 25 Therfor Moyses siy the puple, that it was maad bare; for Aaron hadde spuylid it for the schenschip of filthe, and hadde maad the puple nakid among enemyes. 
\v 26 And Moises stood in the yate of the castels, and seide, If ony man is of the Lord, be he ioyned to me; and alle the sones of Leuy weren gaderid to hym. 
\v 27 To whiche he seide, The Lord God of Israel seith these thingis, A man putte swerd on his hipe, go ye, and `go ye ayen fro yate `til to yate bi the myddil of the castels, and ech man sle his brother, freend, and neiybore. 
\v 28 The sones of Leuy diden bi the word of Moises, and as thre and twenti thousynd \f + \fr 32:28  \ft  In Ebru it is had thre thousend oonly, sume men acorden thus that is diuersite, and seyn, in Ebreu ben noumbrid oonly thei that weren pryncipals in the trespas, that is, indusinge othere men, but with these were slayn so mani of othere that the noumbre stie to xxiij. thousende; either thus, thre thousende felden bi the swerdis of Leuytis, and xx. thousende felden bi othere punchynges. \f* of men felden doun in that day. 
\v 29 And Moises seide, Ye han halewid youre hondis to dai to the Lord, ech man in his sone, and brother, that blessyng be youun to you. 
\v 30 Sotheli whanne `the tother day was maad, Moises spak to the puple, Ye han synned the moost synne; Y schal stie to the Lord, if in ony maner Y schal mowe biseche hym for youre felony. 
\v 31 And he turnede ayen to the Lord, and seide, Lord, Y biseche, this puple hath synned a greet synne, and thei han maad goldun goddis to hem; ethir foryyue thou this gilt to hem, 
\v 32 ether if thou doist not, do awey me fro thi book, which thou hast write. 
\v 33 To whom the Lord answeride, Y schal do awey fro my book hym that synneth ayens me; 
\v 34 forsothe go thou, and lede this puple, whydur Y spak to thee; myn aungel schal go bifore thee; forsothe in the day of veniaunce Y schal visite also this synne of hem. 
\v 35 Therfor the Lord smoot the puple for the gilt of the calf, which calf Aaron made. 
\c 33  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spak to Moyses, and seide, Go and stie fro this place, thou, and the puple, whom thou leddist out of the lond of Egipt, in to the lond, which Y haue swore to Abraham, and to Ysaac, and to Jacob, `and Y seide, Y schal yyue it to thi seed. 
\v 2 And Y schal sende thi bifore goere an aungel, that Y caste out Cananey, and Amorei, and Ethei, and Ferezei, and Euey, and Jebusey; 
\v 3 and that thou entre in to the lond flowynge with mylk and hony; for Y schal not stye with thee, for `thou art a puple of hard nol, lest perauenture Y leese thee in the weie. 
\v 4 The puple herde this worste word, and morenyde, and noon was clothid with his ournyng bi custom. 
\v 5 And the Lord seide to Moises, Spek thou to the sones of Israel, Thou art a puple of hard nol; onys Y schal stie in the myddis of thee, and Y schal do awey thee; riyt now putte awei thin ournyng,\f + \fr 33:5  \ft  ournyng, that is, corounes whiche thei maden in resseyuinge of the lawe. \f* that Y wite, what Y schal do to thee. 
\v 6 Therfor the sones of Israel puttiden awey her ournyng fro the hil of Oreb. 
\v 7 And Moises took the tabernacle, and settide fer with out the castels, and he clepide the name therof the tabernacle of boond of pees. And al the puple that hadde ony questioun, yede out to the tabernacle of boond of pees, with out the castels. 
\v 8 And whanne Moises yede out to the tabernacle, al the puple roos, and ech man stood in the dore of his tente, and thei bihelden `the bak of Moises, til he entride in to the tente. 
\v 9 Sotheli whanne he entride in to the tabernacle of boond of pees, a piler of cloude cam doun, and stood at the dore; and the Lord spak with Moises, 
\v 10 while alle men sien that the piler of cloude stood at the `dore of tabernacle; and thei stoden, and worschipiden bi the dores of her tabernaclis. 
\v 11 Forsothe the Lord spak to Moises face to face, as a man is wont to speke to his freend; and whanne he turnede ayen in to `the castels, Josue, his mynystre, the sone of Nun, a child, yede not awey fro the tabernacle. 
\v 12 Forsothe Moises seide to the Lord, Thou comaundist, that Y lede out this puple, and thou `schewist not to me, whom thou schalt sende with me, `most sithen thou seidist, Y knewe thee bi name, and thou hast founde grace bifore me. 
\v 13 Therfore if Y haue founde grace in thi siyt, schewe thi face to me, that Y knowe thee, and fynde grace bifor thin iyen; biholde thi puple, and this folk. 
\v 14 And God seide, My face schal go bifor thee, and Y schal yyue reste to thee. 
\v 15 And Moises seide, If thi silf schalt not go bifore, `lede not vs out of this place; 
\v 16 for in what thing moun we wite, Y and thi puple, that we han founde grace in thi siyt, if thou schalt not go with vs, that we be glorified of alle puplis that dwellen on erthe? 
\v 17 Forsothe the Lord seide to Moises, Y schal do also this word, which thou hast spoke; for thou hast founde grace bifor me, and Y knewe thi silf bi name. 
\v 18 And Moises seide, Schewe thou thi glorie to me. 
\v 19 God answeride, Y schal schewe al good to thee, and Y schal clepe in the `name of the Lord bifor thee, and Y schal do merci to whom Y wole, and Y schal be merciful on whom it plesith to me. 
\v 20 And eft God seide, Thou maist not se my face, for a man schal not se me, and schal lyue. 
\v 21 And eft God seide, A place is anentis me, and thou schalt stonde on a stoon; 
\v 22 and whanne my glorie schal passe, Y schal sette thee in the hoole of the stoon, and Y schal kyuere with my riyt hond, til Y passe; and Y schal take awey myn hond, 
\v 23 and thou schalt se myn hyndrere partis, forsothe thou mayst not se my face. 
\c 34  
\p
\v 1 And aftirward God seide, Hewe to thee twey tablis of stoon at the licnesse of the formere, and Y schal write on tho tablis thilke wordis, whiche the tablis, that thou `hast broke, hadden. 
\v 2 Be thou redi in the morewtid, that thou stie anoon in to the hil of Synai; and thou schalt stonde with me on the cop of the hil; 
\v 3 no man stie with thee, nether ony man be seyn bi al the hil, and oxun and scheep be not fed ayens `the hil. 
\v 4 Therfor Moises hewide twey tablis of stoon, whiche manere tablis weren bifore, and he roos bi nyyt, and stiede in to the hil of Synay, as the Lord comaundide to hym; and he bar with hym the tablis. 
\v 5 And whanne the Lord hadde come doun bi a cloude, Moises stood with hym, and clepide inwardli `the name of the Lord; 
\v 6 and whanne the Lord passide bifore hym, he seide, Lordschipere, Lord God, mercyful, and pitouse, pacient, and of myche mersiful doyng, and sothefast, 
\v 7 which kepist couenaunt and mercy in to `a thousande, which doist awey wickidnesse, and trespassis, and synnes, and noon bi hym silf is innocent anentis thee, which yeldist the wickidnesse of fadris to sones and to sones of sones, into the thridde and fourthe generacioun. 
\v 8 And hastili Moises was bowid low `in to erthe, and worschipide, 
\v 9 and seide, Lord, if Y haue founde grace in thi siyt, Y biseche that thou go with vs, for the puple is of hard nol, and that thou do awey oure wickidnesses and synnes, and welde vs. 
\v 10 The Lord answeride, Y schal make couenaunt, and in siyt of alle men Y schal make signes, that weren neuer seyn on erthe, nether in ony folkis, that this puple, in whos myddis thou art, se the ferdful werk of the Lord, which Y schal make. 
\v 11 Kepe thou alle thingis, whiche Y comaundide to thee to dai; I my silf schal caste out bifor thi face Amorrey, and Cananey, and Ethei, and Ferezei, and Euey, and Jebusei. 
\v 12 Be war, lest ony tyme thou ioyne frendschipis with the dwelleris of that lond, whiche frenschipis be in to fallyng to thee. 
\v 13 But also distrie thou `the auteris of hem, breke the ymagis, and kitte doun the woodis; 
\v 14 `nyl thou worschipe an alien God; `the Lord a gelous louyere is his name, God is a feruent louyere; 
\v 15 make thou not couenaunt with the men of tho cuntreis, lest whanne thei han do fornycacioun with her goddis, and han worschipid the symylacris of hem, ony man clepe thee, that thou ete of thingis offrid to an ydol. 
\v 16 Nether thou schalt take a wyif of her douytris to thi sones, lest aftir that tho douytris han do fornycacioun, thei make also thi sones to do fornicacioun in to her goddis. 
\v 17 Thou schalt not make to thee yotun goddis. 
\v 18 Thou schalt kepe the solempynyte of therf looues; seuene daies thou schalt ete therf looues, as Y comaundide to thee, in the time of the monethe of newe fruytis; for in the monethe of veer tyme thou yedist out of Egipt. 
\v 19 Al thing of male kynde that openeth the wombe schal be myn, of alle lyuynge beestis, as wel of oxun, as of scheep, it schal be myn. 
\v 20 Thou schalt ayenbie with a scheep the firste gendrid of an asse, ellis if thou yyuest not prijs therfor, it schal be slayn. Thou schalt ayenbie the firste gendrid of thi sones; nether thou schalt appere voide in my siyt. 
\v 21 Sixe daies thou schalt worche, the seuenthe day thou schalt ceesse to ere and repe. 
\v 22 Thou schalt make to thee the solempnyte of woukis in the firste thingis of fruytis of thi ripe corn of wheete, and the solempnyte, whanne alle thingis ben gadrid in to bernes, whanne the tyme `of yeer cometh ayen. 
\v 23 Ech male kynde of thee schal appere in thre tymes of the yeer in the siyt of the Lord Almyyti, thi God of Israel. 
\v 24 For whanne Y schal take awei folkis fro thi face, and Y schal alarge thi termes, noon schal sette tresouns to thi lond, while thou stiest and apperist in the siyt of thi Lord God, thries in the yeer. 
\v 25 Thou schalt not offre on sour dow the blood of my sacrifice, nethir ony thing of the slayn sacrifice of the solempnyte of fase schal abide in the morewtid. 
\v 26 Thou schalt offre in the hows of thi Lord God the firste of the fruytis of thi lond. Thou schalt not sethe a kide in the mylk of his modir. 
\v 27 And the Lord seide to Moises, Write thou these wordis, bi whiche Y smoot a boond of pees, bothe with thee and with Israel. 
\v 28 Therfor Moises was there with the Lord bi fourti daies and bi fourti nyytis, he eet not breed, and drank not watir; and he wroot in tablys ten wordis of the boond of pees. 
\v 29 And whanne Moises cam doun fro the hil of Synai, he helde twei tablis of witnessyng, and he wiste not that his face was horned \f + \fr 34:29  \ft  was horned, beemes of wondurful schynyng yeden `forth an hiy [from him] at the maner of hornes, whiche the postle in ij. pistle to Cor. iij. co. clepith the glorie of Moises face, wherfor in Ebreu it is thus, `and he [Israel] knew not that the `liyt [skyn] of his face was horned. \f* of the felouschipe of Goddis word. 
\v 30 Forsothe Aaron and the sones of Israel sien Moises face horned, 
\v 31 and thei dredden to neiye niy, and thei weren clepid of hym, `and thei turneden ayen, as wel Aaron as the princis of the synagoge; and after that Moises spak, thei camen to hym, 
\v 32 yhe alle the sones of Israel; to whiche Moises comaundide alle thingis, whiche he hadde herd of the Lord in the hil of Synai. 
\v 33 And whanne the wordis weren fillid, he puttide a veil on his face; 
\v 34 and he entride to the Lord, and spak with hym, and dide awey that veil, til he yede out; and thanne he spak to the sones of Israel alle thingis, that weren comaundid to hym; 
\v 35 whiche sien that the face of Moyses goynge out was horned, but eft he hilide his face, if ony tyme he spak to hem. 
\c 35  
\p
\v 1 Therfor whanne al the cumpanye of the sones of Israel was gaderid, Moises seide to hem, These thingis it ben, whiche the Lord comaundide to be doon. 
\v 2 Sixe daies ye schulen do werk, the seuenthe dai schal be hooli to you, the sabat and reste of the Lord; he that doith werk in the sabat schal be slayn. 
\v 3 Ye schulen not kyndle fier in alle youre dwellyng places bi the `dai of sabat. 
\v 4 And Moises seide to al the cumpeny of the sones of Israel, This is the word which the Lord comaundide, and seide, 
\v 5 Departe ye at you the firste fruytis to the Lord; ech wilful man and of redi wille offre tho to the Lord, gold, and siluer, and bras, 
\v 6 and iacynct, and purpur, and reed selk twies died, and bijs, heeris of geet, 
\v 7 and skynnys of rammes maad reed, and of iacynt, 
\v 8 trees of Sechym, and oile to liytis to be ordeyned, and that the oynement be maad, and encense moost swete, 
\v 9 stoonus of onochyn and gemmes, to the ournyng of the `cloth on the schuldris, and of the racional. 
\v 10 Who euer of you is wijs, come he, and make that, that the Lord comaundide, 
\v 11 that is, the tabernacle, and the roof therof, and the hilyng; ryngis, and bildyngis of tablis, with barris, stakis, and foundementis; 
\v 12 the arke, and barris; the propiciatorie, and the veil, which is hangid byfore it; 
\v 13 the bord with barris, and vesselis, and with looues of settyng forth; 
\v 14 the candilstike to susteyne liytis, the vesselis, and lanternes therof, and oile to the nurschyngis of fyris; the auter of encense, and the barris; 
\v 15 the oile of anoyntyng, and encense of swete smellynge spiceries; the tente at the dore of the tabernacle;

\v 17 the curteyns of the large street, with pileris and foundementis; the tente in the doris of the porche; 
\v 18 the stakis of the tabernacle and of the large street, with her coordis; 
\v 19 the clothis, whose vss is in `the seruyce of seyntuarie; the clothis of Aaron bischop, and of hise sones, that thei be set in preesthod to me. 
\v 20 And al the multitude of the sones of Israel yede out of `the siyt of Moises, 
\v 21 and offride with moost redi soule and deuout the firste thingis to the Lord, to make the werk of the tabernacle of witnessyng, what euer was nedeful to the ournyng, and to hooli clothis. 
\v 22 Men and wymmen yauen bies of the armes, and eeryngis, ryngis, and ournementis of `the arm niy the hond; ech goldun vessel was departid in to the yiftis of the Lord. 
\v 23 If ony man hadde iacynt, and purpur, and `reed selk twies died, bijs, and the heeris of geet, skynnes of rammes maad reed, and of iacynt, 
\v 24 metals of siluer, and of bras, thei offeryden to the Lord, and trees of Sechym in to dyuerse vsis. 
\v 25 But also wymmen tauyt yauen tho thingis, whiche thei hadden spunne, iacynt, purpur, and vermyloun, 
\v 26 and bijs, and the heeris of geet; and yauen alle thingis by her owne fre wille. 
\v 27 Forsothe princes offeriden stoonys of onychyn and iemmes, to the `cloth on the schuldris, and to the racional, and swete smellynge spiceries, 
\v 28 and oyle to the liytis to be ordeyned, and to make redi oynement, and to make the encense of swettist odour. 
\v 29 Alle men and wymmen offeriden yiftis with deuout soule, that the werkis schulden be maad, whiche the Lord comaundide bi the hond of Moyses; alle the sones of Israel halewiden wilful thingis to the Lord. 
\v 30 And Moises seide to the sones of Israel, Lo! the Lord hath clepid Beseleel bi name, the sone of Hury, sone of Hur, of the lynage of Juda; 
\v 31 and the Lord hath fillid hym with the spirit of God, of wisdom, and of vndurstondyng, and of kunnyng, and with al doctryn, 
\v 32 to fynde out and to make werk in gold, and siluer, and bras, and in stoonys to be grauun, 
\v 33 and in werk of carpentrie; what euer thing may be foundun craftili, the Lord yaf in his herte; 
\v 34 and the Lord clepide Ooliab, the sone of Achymasech, of the lynage of Dan; 
\v 35 the Lord tauyte bothe `with wisdom, that thei make the werkis of carpenter, of steynour, and of broiderere, of iacynt, and purpur, and of `reed selk, and of bijs, and that thei make alle thingis, and fynde alle newe thingis. 
\c 36

\v 2 And whanne Moises hadde clepid hem, and ech lerned man, to whom the Lord hadde youe wisdom and kunnyng, and whiche profriden hem bi her wille to make werk, 
\v 3 he bitook to hem alle the yiftis of the sones of Israel. And whanne thei weren bisi in the werk ech dai, the puple offride auowis eerli. 
\v 4 Wherfor the werkmen weren compellid to come, 
\v 5 and thei seiden to Moises, The puple offrith more than is nedeful. 
\v 6 Therfor Moises comaundide to be cried bi the vois of a criere, Nether man nether womman offre more ony thing in the werk of seyntuarie; and so it was ceessid fro yiftis to be offrid, for the thingis offrid sufficiden, 
\v 7 and weren ouer abundant. 
\v 8 And alle wise men in herte to fille the werk of the tabernacle maden ten curteyns of bijs foldid ayen, and of iacynct, and purpur, and of reed selk twies died, bi dyuerse werk, and bi the craft of many colouris. 
\v 9 Of whiche curteyns oon hadde in lengthe eiyte and twenti cubitis, and foure cubitis in breede; o mesure was of alle curteyns. 
\v 10 And he ioynede fyue curteyns oon to anothir, and he couplide othere fyue to hem silf to gidere; 
\v 11 and he made handlis of iacynt in the hemme of o curteyn on euer either side, 
\v 12 and in lijk maner in the hemme of the tother curteyn, that the handlis schulen comen to gidere ayens hem silf, and schulen be ioyned togider; 
\v 13 wherfor he yettide also fifti goldun serclis, that schulen `bite the handlis of curteyns; and o tabernacle was maad. 
\v 14 `He made also enleuene saies of the heeris of geet, to hile the roof of the tabernacle; 
\v 15 o saie hadde thretti cubitis in lengthe, foure cubitis in breede; alle the saies weren of o mesure; 
\v 16 of whiche saies he ioynede fyue bi hem silf, and sixe othere bi hem silf. 
\v 17 And he made fifti handlis in the hemme of o say, and fifti in the hemme of the tother say, that tho schulden be ioyned to hem silf to gidere; and he made fifti bokelis of bras bi whiche 
\v 18 the roof was fastned to gidere, that oon hilyng were maad of alle the saies. 
\v 19 He made also an hilyng of the tabernacle of the skynnes of rammes maad reed, and another veil aboue of skynnes of iacynt. 
\v 20 He made also stondynge tablis of the tabernacle of the trees of Sechym; 
\v 21 the lengthe of o table was of ten cubitis, and the breede helde o cubit and an half. 
\v 22 Twey dentyngis weren bi ech table, that the oon schulde be ioyned to the tother; so he made in al the tablis of the tabernacle. 
\v 23 Of whiche tablis twenti weren at the mydday coost ayens the south, 
\v 24 with fourti foundementis of siluer; twey foundementis weren set vndur o table on euer either side of the corneris, where the dentyngis of the sidis weren endid in the corneris. 
\v 25 And at the coost of the tabernacle that biholdith to the north he made twenti tablis,

\v 27 Forsothe ayens the west \f + \fr 36:27  \ft  This that sueth, that is, al that part of the tabernacle that biholdith the see, is not in Ebru. \f* he made sixe tablis,

\v 29 whiche weren ioyned fro bynethe til to aboue, and weren borun in to o ioynyng to gidere; so he made on euer either part bi the corneris, 
\v 30 that tho weren eiyte tablis to gidere, and hadden sixtene foundementis of siluer, that is, twei foundementis vndur ech table. 
\v 31 He made also barris of the trees of Sechym, fyue barris to holde to gidere the tablis of o side of the tabernacle, 
\v 32 and fyue othere barris to schappe to gidere the tablis of the tother side; and without these, he made fyue othere barris at the west coost of the tabernacle ayens the see. 
\v 33 He made also another barre, that schulde come bi the myddil tables fro corner til to corner. 
\v 34 Forsothe he ouergildide tho wallis of tablis, and yetide the siluerne foundementis `of tho, and he made the goldun serclis `of tho, bi whiche the barris myyten be brouyt in, and be hilide the same barris with goldun platis.

\v 36 He made also foure pileris of `the trees of Sechym, whyche pileris with the heedis he ouergildide, and yetide the siluerne foundementis `of tho. 
\v 37 He made also in the entryng of the tabernacle a tent of iacynt, and purpur, and reed selk `and bijs foldid ayen bi the werk of a broydreie. 
\v 38 And he made fyue pileris with her heedis, whiche he hilide with gold, and he yetide the brasun foundementis `of tho, whiche he hilide with gold. 
\c 37

\v 1 Forsothe Beseleel made also an arke of the trees of Sechym, hauynge twey cubitis and an half in lengthe, and a cubit and an half in breede; forsothe the hiynesse was of o cubit and an half; and he clothide the arke with purest gold, with ynne and without forth. 
\v 2 And he made to it a goldun coroun `bi cumpas, 
\v 3 and yetide foure goldun ryngis, bi foure corneris therof, twey ryngis in o side, and twei ryngis in the tother side. 
\v 4 And he made barris of the trees of Sechym, whiche barris he clothide with gold,

\v 6 He made also a propiciatorie, that is, Goddis answeryng place, of pureste gold, of twei cubitis and an half in lengthe, and of o cubit and an half in breede.
