\mt1 THE EPISTLE OF PAUL THE APOSTLE TO TITUS 
\c 1

\v 1 Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is according to godliness; 
\v 2 In hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before the world began; 
\v 3 But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed to me according to the commandment of God our Savior; 
\v 4 To Titus, \add my\add* own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, \add and\add* peace, from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior. 
\v 5 For this cause I left thee in Crete, that thou shouldst set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee: 
\v 6 If any is blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children, not accused of riot, or disorderly. 
\v 7 For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not self-willed, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre; 
\v 8 But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate; 
\v 9 Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers. 
\v 10 For there are many disorderly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision: 
\v 11 Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for the sake of sordid gain. 
\v 12 One of themselves, \add even\add* a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians \add are\add* always liars, evil beasts, slow bellies. 
\v 13 This testimony is true: wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith; 
\v 14 Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men that turn from the truth. 
\v 15 To the pure all things \add are\add* pure: but to them that are defiled and unbelieving \add is\add* nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled. 
\v 16 They profess that they know God; but in works they deny \add him\add* , being abominable, and disobedient, and to every good work reprobate.

\v 1 But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine: 
\v 2 That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience; 
\v 3 The aged women likewise, that \add they be\add* in behavior as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things; 
\v 4 That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children, 
\v 5  \add To be\add* discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed. 
\v 6 Young men likewise exhort to be sober-minded. 
\v 7 In all things showing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine \add showing\add* incorruptness, gravity, sincerity, 
\v 8 Sound speech that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say concerning you. 
\v 9  \add Exhort\add* servants to be obedient to their own masters, \add and\add* to please \add them\add* well in all \add things\add* ; not answering again; 
\v 10 Not purloining, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things. 
\v 11 For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, 
\v 12 Teaching us, that denying ungodliness, and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and piously, in this present world; 
\v 13 Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Savior Jesus Christ; 
\v 14 Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works. 
\v 15 These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.

\v 1 Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work, 
\v 2 To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, \add but\add* gentle, showing all meekness to all men. 
\v 3 For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, \add and\add* hating one another. 
\v 4 But when the kindness and love of God our Savior towards man appeared, 
\v 5 Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Spirit; 
\v 6 Which he shed on us abundantly, through Jesus Christ our Savior; 
\v 7 That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life. 
\v 8  \add This is\add* a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they who have believed in God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men. 
\v 9 But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain. 
\v 10 A man that is a heretic, after the first and second admonition, reject; 
\v 11 Knowing that he who is such, is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned by himself. 
\v 12 When I shall send Artemas to thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter. 
\v 13 Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing may be wanting to them. 
\v 14 And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful. 
\v 15 All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace \add be\add* with you all. Amen.
