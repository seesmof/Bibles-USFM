\v 1 The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel; 
\v 2 To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding; 
\v 3 To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity; 
\v 4 To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion. 
\v 5 A wise \add man\add* will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain to wise counsels: 
\v 6 To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings. 
\v 7 The fear of the LORD \add is\add* the beginning of knowledge: \add but\add* fools despise wisdom and instruction. 
\v 8 My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother: 
\v 9 For they \add shalt be\add* an ornament of grace to thy head, and chains about thy neck. 
\v 10 My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not. 
\v 11 If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause: 
\v 12 Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit: 
\v 13 We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil: 
\v 14 Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse: 
\v 15 My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path: 
\v 16 For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood. 
\v 17 Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird. 
\v 18 And they lay wait for their \add own\add* blood; they lurk privily for their \add own\add* lives. 
\v 19 So \add are\add* the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; \add who\add* taketh away the life of its owners. 
\v 20 Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets: 
\v 21 She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, \add saying\add* , 
\v 22 How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge? 
\v 23 Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit to you, I will make known to you my words. 
\v 24 Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded; 
\v 25 But ye have set at naught all my counsel, and rejected my reproof: 
\v 26 I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; 
\v 27 When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you. 
\v 28 Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me: 
\v 29 For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD: 
\v 30 They rejected my counsel: they despised all my reproof. 
\v 31 Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices. 
\v 32 For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them. 
\v 33 But whoever hearkeneth to me shall dwell in safety, and shall be quiet from fear of evil. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee; 
\v 2 So that thou incline thy ear to wisdom, \add and\add* apply thy heart to understanding; 
\v 3 Yes, if thou criest after knowledge, \add and\add* liftest up thy voice for understanding; 
\v 4 If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as \add for\add* hid treasures; 
\v 5 Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God. 
\v 6 For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth \add cometh\add* knowledge and understanding. 
\v 7 He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: \add he is\add* a buckler to them that walk uprightly. 
\v 8 He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints. 
\v 9 Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; \add and\add* every good path. 
\v 10 When wisdom entereth into thy heart, and knowledge is pleasant to thy soul; 
\v 11 Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee: 
\v 12 To deliver thee from the way of the evil \add man\add* , from the man that speaketh froward things; 
\v 13 Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness; 
\v 14 Who rejoice to do evil, \add and\add* delight in the frowardness of the wicked; 
\v 15 Whose ways \add are\add* crooked, and \add they\add* froward in their paths: 
\v 16 To deliver thee from the strange woman, \add even\add* from the stranger \add who\add* flattereth with her words; 
\v 17 Who forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God. 
\v 18 For her house inclineth to death, and her paths to the dead. 
\v 19 None that go to her return again, neither do they take hold of the paths of life. 
\v 20 That thou mayest walk in the way of good \add men\add* , and keep the paths of the righteous. 
\v 21 For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it. 
\v 22 But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 My son, forget not my law; but let thy heart keep my commandments; 
\v 2 For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee. 
\v 3 Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thy heart: 
\v 4 So shalt thou find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man. 
\v 5 Trust in the LORD with all thy heart; and lean not to thy own understanding. 
\v 6 In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he will direct thy paths. 
\v 7 Be not wise in thy own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil. 
\v 8 It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones. 
\v 9 Honor the LORD with thy substance, and with the first-fruits of all thy increase: 
\v 10 So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine. 
\v 11 My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction: 
\v 12 For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son \add in whom\add* he delighteth. 
\v 13 Happy \add is\add* the man \add that\add* findeth wisdom, and the man \add that\add* getteth understanding. 
\v 14 For the merchandise of it \add is\add* better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain of it than fine gold. 
\v 15 She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared to her. 
\v 16 Length of days \add is\add* in her right hand; \add and\add* in her left hand riches and honor. 
\v 17 Her ways \add are\add* ways of pleasantness, and all her paths \add are\add* peace. 
\v 18 She \add is\add* a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy \add is every one\add* that retaineth her. 
\v 19 The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens. 
\v 20 By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew. 
\v 21 My son, let not them depart from thy eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion: 
\v 22 So shall they be life to thy soul, and grace to thy neck. 
\v 23 Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble. 
\v 24 When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: but thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet. 
\v 25 Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh. 
\v 26 For the LORD will be thy confidence, and will keep thy foot from being taken. 
\v 27 Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thy hand to do \add it\add* . 
\v 28 Say not to thy neighbor, Go, and come again, and to-morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee. 
\v 29 Devise not evil against thy neighbor, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee. 
\v 30 Strive not with a man without cause, if he hath done thee no harm. 
\v 31 Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways. 
\v 32 For the froward \add is\add* abomination to the LORD: but his secret \add is\add* with the righteous. 
\v 33 The curse of the LORD \add is\add* in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just. 
\v 34 Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace to the lowly. 
\v 35 The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools.

\v 1 Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding. 
\v 2 For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law. 
\v 3 For I was my father's son, tender and only \add beloved\add* in the sight of my mother. 
\v 4 He taught me also, and said to me, Let thy heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live. 
\v 5 Get wisdom, get understanding: forget \add it\add* not; neither decline from the words of my mouth. 
\v 6 Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee. 
\v 7 Wisdom \add is\add* the principal thing; \add therefore\add* get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding. 
\v 8 Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honor, when thou dost embrace her. 
\v 9 She shall give to thy head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee. 
\v 10 Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many. 
\v 11 I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths. 
\v 12 When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble. 
\v 13 Take fast hold of instruction; let \add her\add* not go: keep her; for she \add is\add* thy life. 
\v 14 Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil \add men\add* . 
\v 15 Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away. 
\v 16 For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause \add some\add* to fall. 
\v 17 For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence. 
\v 18 But the path of the just \add is\add* as the shining light, that shineth more and more to the perfect day. 
\v 19 The way of the wicked \add is\add* as darkness: they know not at what they stumble. 
\v 20 My son, attend to my words; incline thy ear to my sayings. 
\v 21 Let them not depart from thy eyes; keep them in the midst of thy heart. 
\v 22 For they \add are\add* life to those that find them, and health to all their flesh. 
\v 23 Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it \add are\add* the issues of life. 
\v 24 Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee. 
\v 25 Let thy eyes look right on, and let thy eyelids look straight before thee. 
\v 26 Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established. 
\v 27 Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 My son, attend to my wisdom, \add and\add* bow thy ear to my understanding: 
\v 2 That thou mayest regard discretion, and \add that\add* thy lips may keep knowledge. 
\v 3 For the lips of a strange woman drop \add as\add* a honey-comb, and her mouth \add is\add* smoother than oil: 
\v 4 But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword. 
\v 5 Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell. 
\v 6 Lest thou shouldst ponder the path of life, her ways are movable, \add that\add* thou canst not know \add them\add* . 
\v 7 Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth. 
\v 8 Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house: 
\v 9 Lest thou give thy honor to others, and thy years to the cruel: 
\v 10 Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labors \add be\add* in the house of a stranger; 
\v 11 And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed, 
\v 12 And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof; 
\v 13 And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined my ear to them that instructed me! 
\v 14 I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly. 
\v 15 Drink waters out of thy own cistern, and running waters out of thy own well. 
\v 16 Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, \add and\add* rivers of waters in the streets. 
\v 17 Let them be only thy own, and not for strangers with thee. 
\v 18 Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth. 
\v 19  \add Let her be as\add* the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love. 
\v 20 And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger? 
\v 21 For the ways of man \add are\add* before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings. 
\v 22 His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be held with the cords of his sins. 
\v 23 He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1 My son, if thou art surety for thy friend, \add if\add* thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger, 
\v 2 Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth. 
\v 3 Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend. 
\v 4 Give not sleep to thy eyes, nor slumber to thy eyelids. 
\v 5 Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand \add of the hunter\add* , and as a bird from the hand of the fowler. 
\v 6 Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise: 
\v 7 Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler, 
\v 8 Provideth her provisions in the summer, \add and\add* gathereth her food in the harvest. 
\v 9 How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep? 
\v 10  \add Yet\add* a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep: 
\v 11 So shall thy poverty come as one that traveleth, and thy want as an armed man. 
\v 12 A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth. 
\v 13 He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers; 
\v 14 Frowardness \add is\add* in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord. 
\v 15 Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy. 
\v 16 These six \add things\add* doth the LORD hate: yes, seven \add are\add* an abomination to him: 
\v 17 A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood. 
\v 18 A heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that are swift in running to mischief, 
\v 19 A false witness \add that\add* speaketh lies, and him that soweth discord among brethren. 
\v 20 My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother: 
\v 21 Bind them continually upon thy heart, \add and\add* tie them about thy neck. 
\v 22 When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and \add when\add* thou awakest, it shall talk with thee. 
\v 23 For the commandment \add is\add* a lamp; and the law \add is\add* light; and reproofs of instruction \add are\add* the way of life: 
\v 24 To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman. 
\v 25 Lust not after her beauty in thy heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids. 
\v 26 For by means of a lewd woman \add a man is brought\add* to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life. 
\v 27 Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? 
\v 28 Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned? 
\v 29 So he that goeth in to his neighbor's wife; whoever toucheth her shall not be innocent. 
\v 30  \add Men\add* do not despise a thief, if he stealeth to satisfy his soul when he is hungry; 
\v 31 But \add if\add* he is found, he shall restore seven-fold; he shall give all the substance of his house. 
\v 32  \add But\add* whoever committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he \add that\add* doeth it destroyeth his own soul. 
\v 33 A wound and dishonor shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away. 
\v 34 For jealousy \add is\add* the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance. 
\v 35 He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1 My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee. 
\v 2 Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thy eye. 
\v 3 Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thy heart. 
\v 4 Say to wisdom, Thou \add art\add* my sister; and call understanding \add thy\add* kinswoman: 
\v 5 That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger \add which\add* flattereth with her words. 
\v 6 For at the window of my house I looked through my casement, 
\v 7 And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding, 
\v 8 Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house. 
\v 9 In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night: 
\v 10 And behold, there met him a woman \add with\add* the attire of a harlot, and subtil of heart. 
\v 11 (She \add is\add* loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house: 
\v 12 Now \add is she\add* without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.) 
\v 13 So she caught him, and kissed him, \add and\add* with an impudent face said to him, 
\v 14  \add I have\add* peace-offerings with me; this day have I paid my vows. 
\v 15 Therefore I came forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee. 
\v 16 I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved \add works\add* , with fine linen of Egypt. 
\v 17 I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 
\v 18 Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves. 
\v 19 For the good-man \add is\add* not at home, he is gone a long journey: 
\v 20 He hath taken a bag of money with him, \add and\add* will come home at the day appointed. 
\v 21 With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she impelled him. 
\v 22 He goeth after her quickly, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks; 
\v 23 Till a dart striketh through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it \add is\add* for his life. 
\v 24 Now therefore hearken to me, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth. 
\v 25 Let not thy heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths. 
\v 26 For she hath cast down many wounded: yes, many strong \add men\add* have been slain by her. 
\v 27 Her house \add is\add* the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1 Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice? 
\v 2 She standeth on the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths. 
\v 3 She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the entrance of the doors. 
\v 4 To you, O men, I call; and my voice \add is\add* to the sons of man. 
\v 5 O ye simple, understand wisdom: and ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart. 
\v 6 Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips \add shall be\add* right things. 
\v 7 For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness \add is\add* an abomination to my lips. 
\v 8 All the words of my mouth \add are\add* in righteousness; \add there is\add* nothing froward or perverse in them. 
\v 9 They \add are\add* all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge. 
\v 10 Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold. 
\v 11 For wisdom \add is\add* better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it. 
\v 12 I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of ingenious inventions. 
\v 13 The fear of the LORD \add is\add* to hate evil: pride, and arrogance, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate. 
\v 14 Counsel \add is\add* mine, and sound wisdom: I \add am\add* understanding; I have strength. 
\v 15 By me kings reign, and princes decree justice. 
\v 16 By me princes rule, and nobles, \add even\add* all the judges of the earth. 
\v 17 I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me. 
\v 18 Riches and honor \add are\add* with me; durable riches and righteousness. 
\v 19 My fruit \add is\add* better than gold, yes, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver. 
\v 20 I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment. 
\v 21 That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures. 
\v 22 The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old. 
\v 23 I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was. 
\v 24 When \add there were\add* no depths, I was brought forth; when \add there were\add* no fountains abounding with water. 
\v 25 Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth. 
\v 26 While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world. 
\v 27 When he prepared the heavens, I \add was\add* there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth: 
\v 28 When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep: 
\v 29 When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth: 
\v 30 Then I was by him, \add as\add* one brought up \add with him\add* : and I was daily \add his\add* delight, rejoicing always before him; 
\v 31 Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights \add were\add* with the sons of men. 
\v 32 Now therefore hearken to me, O ye children: for blessed \add are they that\add* keep my ways. 
\v 33 Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not. 
\v 34 Blessed \add is\add* the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors. 
\v 35 For whoever findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favor from the LORD. 
\v 36 But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 Wisdom hath built her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars: 
\v 2 She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table. 
\v 3 She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest places of the city, 
\v 4 Whoever \add is\add* simple, let him turn in hither: \add as for\add* him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him, 
\v 5 Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine \add which\add* I have mingled. 
\v 6 Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding. 
\v 7 He that reproveth a scorner, getteth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked \add man getteth\add* himself a blot. 
\v 8 Reprove not a scorner, lest he shall hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee. 
\v 9 Give \add instruction\add* to a wise \add man\add* , and he will be yet wiser: teach a just \add man\add* , and he will increase in learning. 
\v 10 The fear of the LORD \add is\add* the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy \add is\add* understanding. 
\v 11 For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased. 
\v 12 If thou art wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but \add if\add* thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear \add it\add* . 
\v 13 A foolish woman \add is\add* clamorous: \add she is\add* simple, and knoweth nothing. 
\v 14 For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city, 
\v 15 To call passengers who go right on their ways: 
\v 16 Whoever \add is\add* simple, let him turn in hither: and \add as for\add* him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him, 
\v 17 Stolen waters are sweet, and bread \add eaten\add* in secret is pleasant. 
\v 18 But he knoweth not that the dead \add are\add* there; \add and that\add* her guests \add are\add* in the depths of hell. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1 The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish son \add is\add* the heaviness of his mother. 
\v 2 Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness delivereth from death. 
\v 3 The LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish: but he casteth away the substance of the wicked. 
\v 4 He becometh poor that dealeth \add with\add* a slack hand: but the hand of the diligent maketh rich. 
\v 5 He that gathereth in summer \add is\add* a wise son: \add but\add* he that sleepeth in harvest \add is\add* a son that causeth shame. 
\v 6 Blessings \add are\add* upon the head of the just: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked. 
\v 7 The memory of the just \add is\add* blessed: but the name of the wicked shall perish. 
\v 8 The wise in heart will receive commandments: but a prating fool shall fall. 
\v 9 He that walketh uprightly walketh surely: but he that perverteth his ways shall be known. 
\v 10 He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but a prating fool shall fall. 
\v 11 The mouth of a righteous \add man is\add* a well of life: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked. 
\v 12 Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all sins. 
\v 13 In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found: but a rod \add is\add* for the back of him that is void of understanding. 
\v 14 Wise \add men\add* lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish \add is\add* near destruction. 
\v 15 The rich man's wealth \add is\add* his strong city: the destruction of the poor \add is\add* their poverty. 
\v 16 The labor of the righteous \add tendeth\add* to life: the fruit of the wicked to sin. 
\v 17 He \add is in\add* the way of life that keepeth instruction: but he that refuseth reproof erreth.

\v 13 He that answereth a matter before he heareth \add it\add* , it \add is\add* folly and shame to him. 
\v 14 The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear? 
\v 15 The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge. 
\v 16 A man's gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men. 
\v 17  \add He that is\add* first in his own cause \add seemeth\add* just; but his neighbor cometh and searcheth him. 
\v 18 The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty. 
\v 19 A brother offended \add is harder to be won\add* than a strong city: and \add their\add* contentions \add are\add* like the bars of a castle. 
\v 20 A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; \add and\add* with the increase of his lips shall he be filled. 
\v 21 Death and life \add are\add* in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit of it. 
\v 22  \add Whoever\add* findeth a wife findeth a good \add thing\add* , and obtaineth favor from the LORD. 
\v 23 The poor useth entreaties; but the rich answereth roughly. 
\v 24 A man \add that hath\add* friends must show himself friendly: and there is a friend \add that\add* sticketh closer than a brother. 
\c 19  
\p
\v 1 Better \add is\add* the poor that walketh in his integrity, than \add he that is\add* perverse in his lips, and is a fool. 
\v 2 Also, \add that\add* the soul \add be\add* without knowledge, \add it is\add* not good; and he that hasteth with \add his\add* feet sinneth. 
\v 3 The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart fretteth against the LORD. 
\v 4 Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his neighbor. 
\v 5 A false witness shall not be unpunished, and \add he that\add* speaketh lies shall not escape. 
\v 6 Many will entreat the favor of the prince: and every man \add is\add* a friend to him that giveth gifts. 
\v 7 All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him? he pursueth \add them with\add* words, \add yet\add* they \add are\add* wanting \add to him\add* . 
\v 8 He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth understanding shall find good. 
\v 9 A false witness shall not be unpunished, and \add he that\add* speaketh lies shall perish. 
\v 10 Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule over princes. 
\v 11 The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and \add it is\add* his glory to pass over a transgression. 
\v 12 The king's wrath \add is\add* as the roaring of a lion; but his favor \add is\add* as dew upon the grass. 
\v 13 A foolish son \add is\add* the calamity of his father: and the contentions of a wife \add are\add* a continual dropping. 
\v 14 House and riches \add are\add* the inheritance of fathers: and a prudent wife \add is\add* from the LORD. 
\v 15 Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger. 
\v 16 He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; \add but\add* he that despiseth his ways shall die. 
\v 17 He that hath pity upon the poor, lendeth to the LORD; and that which he hath given will he pay him again. 
\v 18 Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying. 
\v 19 A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou deliver \add him\add* , yet thou must do it again. 
\v 20 Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end. 
\v 21  \add There are\add* many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand. 
\v 22 The desire of a man \add is\add* his kindness: and a poor man \add is\add* better than a liar. 
\v 23 The fear of the LORD \add tendeth\add* to life: and \add he that hath it\add* shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil. 
\v 24 A slothful \add man\add* hideth his hand in \add his\add* bosom, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again. 
\v 25 Smite a scorner and the simple will beware: and reprove one that hath understanding, \add and\add* he will understand knowledge. 
\v 26 He that wasteth \add his\add* father, \add and\add* chaseth away \add his\add* mother, \add is\add* a son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach. 
\v 27 Cease, my son, to hear the instruction \add that causeth\add* to err from the words of knowledge. 
\v 28 An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity. 
\v 29 Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of fools. 
\c 20  
\p
\v 1 Wine \add is\add* a mocker, strong drink \add is\add* raging: and whoever is deceived by it is not wise. 
\v 2 The fear of a king \add is\add* as the roaring of a lion: \add whoever\add* provoketh him to anger sinneth \add against\add* his own soul. 
\v 3  \add It is\add* an honor for a man to cease from strife: but every fool will be meddling. 
\v 4 The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; \add therefore\add* shall he beg in harvest, and \add have\add* nothing. 
\v 5 Counsel in the heart of man \add is like\add* deep water; but a man of understanding will draw it out. 
\v 6 Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a faithful man who can find? 
\v 7 The just \add man\add* walketh in his integrity: his children \add are\add* blessed after him. 
\v 8 A king that sitteth on the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil with his eyes. 
\v 9 Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin? 
\v 10 Divers weights, \add and\add* divers measures, both of them \add are\add* alike abomination to the LORD. 
\v 11 Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work \add is\add* pure, and whether \add it is\add* right. 
\v 12 The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even both of them. 
\v 13 Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thy eyes, \add and\add* thou shalt be satisfied with bread. 
\v 14  \add It is\add* naught, \add it is\add* naught, saith the buyer: but when he is gone, then he boasteth. 
\v 15 There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of knowledge \add are\add* a precious jewel. 
\v 16 Take his garment that is surety \add for\add* a stranger: and take a pledge of him for a strange woman. 
\v 17 Bread of deceit \add is\add* sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel. 
\v 18  \add Every\add* purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice make war. 
\v 19 He that goeth about \add as\add* a tale-bearer revealeth secrets; therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips. 
\v 20 Whoever curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness. 
\v 21 An inheritance \add may be\add* gotten hastily at the beginning; but the end of it shall not be blessed. 
\v 22 Say not thou, I will recompense evil; \add but\add* wait on the LORD, and he shall save thee. 
\v 23 Divers weights \add are\add* an abomination to the LORD; and a false balance \add is\add* not good. 
\v 24 Man's goings \add are\add* of the LORD; how can a man then understand his own way? 
\v 25  \add It is\add* a snare to the man \add who\add* devoureth \add that which is\add* holy, and after vows to make inquiry. 
\v 26 A wise king scatterreth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over them. 
\v 27 The spirit of man \add is\add* the candle of the LORD, searching all the inward parts of the belly. 
\v 28 Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upheld by mercy. 
\v 29 The glory of young men \add is\add* their strength: and the beauty of old men \add is\add* the gray head. 
\v 30 The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so \add do\add* stripes the inward parts of the belly. 
\c 21  
\p
\v 1 The king's heart \add is\add* in the hand of the LORD, \add as\add* the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will. 
\v 2 Every way of a man \add is\add* right in his own eyes: but the LORD pondereth the hearts. 
\v 3 To do justice and judgment \add is\add* more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice. 
\v 4 A high look, and a proud heart, \add and\add* the plowing of the wicked, \add is\add* sin. 
\v 5 The thoughts of the diligent \add tend\add* only to plenteousness; but of every one \add that is\add* hasty only to want. 
\v 6 The getting of treasures by a lying tongue \add is\add* a vanity tossed to and fro by them that seek death. 
\v 7 The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they refuse to do judgment. 
\v 8 The way of man \add is\add* froward and strange: but \add as for\add* the pure, his work \add is\add* right. 
\v 9  \add It is\add* better to dwell in a corner of the house-top, than with a brawling woman in a wide house. 
\v 10 The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbor findeth no favor in his eyes. 
\v 11 When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge. 
\v 12 The righteous \add man\add* wisely considereth the house of the wicked: \add but God\add* overthroweth the wicked for \add their\add* wickedness. 
\v 13 Whoever stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard. 
\v 14 A gift in secret pacifieth anger: and a reward in the bosom, strong wrath. 
\v 15  \add It is\add* joy to the just to do judgment: but destruction \add shall be\add* to the workers of iniquity. 
\v 16 The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead. 
\v 17 He that loveth pleasure \add shall be\add* a poor man: he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich. 
\v 18 The wicked \add shall be\add* a ransom for the righteous, and the transgressor for the upright. 
\v 19  \add It is\add* better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a contentious and an angry woman. 
\v 20  \add There is\add* a treasure to be desired, and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up. 
\v 21 He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life, righteousness, and honor. 
\v 22 A wise \add man\add* scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down the strength of its confidence. 
\v 23 Whoever keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles. 
\v 24 Proud \add and\add* haughty scorner \add is\add* his name, who dealeth in proud wrath. 
\v 25 The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse to labor. 
\v 26 He coveteth greedily all the day long: but the righteous giveth and spareth not. 
\v 27 The sacrifice of the wicked \add is\add* abomination: how much more, \add when\add* he bringeth it with a wicked mind? 
\v 28 A false witness shall perish: but the man that heareth speaketh constantly. 
\v 29 A wicked man hardeneth his face: but \add as for\add* the upright, he directeth his way. 
\v 30  \add There is\add* no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the LORD. 
\v 31 The horse \add is\add* prepared against the day of battle: but safety \add is\add* from the LORD. 
\c 22  
\p
\v 1 A \add good\add* name \add is\add* rather to be chosen than great riches, \add and\add* loving favor rather than silver and gold. 
\v 2 The rich and poor meet together: the LORD \add is\add* the maker of them all. 
\v 3 A prudent \add man\add* foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself: but the simple pass on, and are punished. 
\v 4 By humility \add and\add* the fear of the LORD \add are\add* riches, and honor, and life. 
\v 5 Thorns \add and\add* snares \add are\add* in the way of the froward: he that doth keep his soul shall be far from them. 
\v 6 Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it. 
\v 7 The rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower \add is\add* servant to the lender. 
\v 8 He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity: and the rod of his anger shall fail. 
\v 9 He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed; for he giveth of his bread to the poor. 
\v 10 Cast out the scorner, and contention shall end; yes, strife and reproach shall cease. 
\v 11 He that loveth pureness of heart, \add for\add* the grace of his lips the king \add shall be\add* his friend. 
\v 12 The eyes of the LORD preserve knowledge, and he overthroweth the words of the transgressor. 
\v 13 The slothful \add man\add* saith, \add There is\add* a lion without, I shall be slain in the streets. 
\v 14 The mouth of strange women \add is\add* a deep pit: he that is abhorred by the LORD shall fall therein. 
\v 15 Foolishness \add is\add* bound in the heart of a child; \add but\add* the rod of correction shall drive it far from him. 
\v 16 He that oppresseth the poor to increase his \add riches\add* , \add and\add* he that giveth to the rich, \add shall\add* surely \add come\add* to want. 
\v 17 Bow down thy ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply thy heart to my knowledge. 
\v 18 For \add it is\add* a pleasant thing if thou keepest them within thee; they shall withal be fitted in thy lips. 
\v 19 That thy trust may be in the LORD, I have made known to thee this day, even to thee. 
\v 20 Have not I written to thee excellent things in counsels and knowledge, 
\v 21 That I might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth; that thou mightest answer the words of truth to them that send to thee? 
\v 22 Rob not the poor, because he \add is\add* poor: neither oppress the afflicted in the gate: 
\v 23 For the LORD will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of those that spoiled them. 
\v 24 Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man thou shalt not go: 
\v 25 Lest thou learn his ways, and get a snare to thy soul. 
\v 26 Be not thou \add one\add* of them that strike hands, \add or\add* of them that are sureties for debts. 
\v 27 If thou hast nothing to pay, why should he take away thy bed from under thee? 
\v 28 Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set. 
\v 29 Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean \add men\add* . 
\c 23  
\p
\v 1 When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what \add is\add* before thee: 
\v 2 And put a knife to thy throat, if thou \add art\add* a man given to appetite. 
\v 3 Be not desirous of his dainties: for they \add are\add* deceitful food. 
\v 4 Labor not to be rich: cease from thy own wisdom. 
\v 5 Wilt thou set thy eyes upon that which is not? for \add riches\add* certainly make to themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle towards heaven. 
\v 6 Eat thou not the bread of \add him that hath\add* an evil eye, neither desire thou his dainties: 
\v 7 For as he thinketh in his heart, so \add is\add* he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; but his heart \add is\add* not with thee. 
\v 8 The morsel \add which\add* thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose thy sweet words. 
\v 9 Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the wisdom of thy words. 
\v 10 Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of the fatherless: 
\v 11 For their redeemer \add is\add* mighty; he will plead their cause with thee. 
\v 12 Apply thy heart to instruction, and thy ears to the words of knowledge. 
\v 13 Withhold not correction from the child: for \add if\add* thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die. 
\v 14 Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell. 
\v 15 My son, if thy heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine. 
\v 16 Yes, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things. 
\v 17 Let not thy heart envy sinners: but \add be thou\add* in the fear of the LORD all the day long. 
\v 18 For surely there is an end; and thy expectation shall not be cut off. 
\v 19 Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thy heart in the way. 
\v 20 Be not among wine-bibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh: 
\v 21 For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness shall clothe \add a man\add* with rags. 
\v 22 Hearken to thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother when she is old. 
\v 23 Buy the truth, and sell \add it\add* not; \add also\add* wisdom, and instruction, and understanding. 
\v 24 The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he that begetteth a wise \add child\add* shall have joy of him. 
\v 25 Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bore thee shall rejoice. 
\v 26 My son, give me thy heart, and let thy eyes observe my ways. 
\v 27 For a lewd woman \add is\add* a deep ditch; and a strange woman \add is\add* a narrow pit. 
\v 28 She also lieth in wait as \add for\add* a prey, and increaseth the transgressors among men. 
\v 29 Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes? 
\v 30 They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine. 
\v 31 Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth its color in the cup, \add when\add* it moveth itself aright. 
\v 32 At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder. 
\v 33 Thy eyes shall behold strange women, and thy heart shall utter perverse things. 
\v 34 And thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast. 
\v 35 They have stricken me, \add wilt thou say\add* , \add and\add* I was not sick; they have beaten me, \add and\add* I felt \add it\add* not: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again. 
\c 24  
\p
\v 1 Be not thou envious against evil men, neither desire to be with them. 
\v 2 For their heart studieth destruction, and their lips talk of mischief. 
\v 3 Through wisdom is a house built; and by understanding it is established: 
\v 4 And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches. 
\v 5 A wise man \add is\add* strong; and a man of knowledge increaseth strength. 
\v 6 For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war: and in multitude of counselors \add there is\add* safety. 
\v 7 Wisdom \add is\add* too high for a fool: he openeth not his mouth in the gate. 
\v 8 He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person. 
\v 9 The thought of foolishness \add is\add* sin: and the scorner \add is\add* an abomination to men. 
\v 10  \add If\add* thou faintest in the day of adversity, thy strength \add is\add* small. 
\v 11 If thou forbearest to deliver \add them that are\add* drawn to death, and \add those that are\add* ready to be slain; 
\v 12 If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider \add it\add* ? and he that keepeth thy soul, doth \add not\add* he know \add it\add* ? and will \add not\add* he render to \add every\add* man according to his works? 
\v 13 My son, eat thou honey, because \add it is\add* good; and the honey-comb, \add which is\add* sweet to thy taste: 
\v 14 So \add shall\add* the knowledge of wisdom \add be\add* to thy soul: when thou hast found \add it\add* , then there shall be a reward, and thy expectation shall not be cut off. 
\v 15 Lay not wait, O wicked \add man\add* , against the dwelling of the righteous; destroy not his resting-place: 
\v 16 For a just \add man\add* falleth seven times, and riseth again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief. 
\v 17 Rejoice not when thy enemy falleth, and let not thy heart be glad when he stumbleth: 
\v 18 Lest the LORD see \add it\add* , and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him. 
\v 19 Fret not thyself because of evil \add men\add* , neither be thou envious at the wicked; 
\v 20 For there shall be no reward to the evil \add man\add* ; the candle of the wicked shall be extinguished. 
\v 21 My son, fear thou the LORD and the king: \add and\add* meddle not with them that are given to change: 
\v 22 For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both? 
\v 23 These \add things\add* also \add belong\add* to the wise. \add It is\add* not good to have respect of persons in judgment. 
\v 24 He that saith to the wicked, Thou \add art\add* righteous; him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him: 
\v 25 But to them that rebuke \add him\add* shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them. 
\v 26  \add Every man\add* shall kiss \add his\add* lips that giveth a right answer. 
\v 27 Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the field; and afterwards build thy house. 
\v 28 Be not a witness against thy neighbor without cause; and deceive \add not\add* with thy lips. 
\v 29 Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me: I will render to the man according to his work. 
\v 30 I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding; 
\v 31 And lo, it was all grown over with thorns, \add and\add* nettles had covered the face of it, and its stone wall was broken down. 
\v 32 Then I saw, \add and\add* considered \add it\add* well: I looked upon \add it\add* , \add and\add* received instruction. 
\v 33  \add Yet\add* a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep: 
\v 34 So shall thy poverty come \add as\add* one that traveleth; and thy want as an armed man. 
\c 25  
\p
\v 1 These \add are\add* also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out. 
\v 2  \add It is\add* the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honor of kings \add is\add* to search out a matter. 
\v 3 The heaven for hight, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings \add is\add* unsearchable. 
\v 4 Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer. 
\v 5 Take away the wicked \add from\add* before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness. 
\v 6 Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great \add men\add* : 
\v 7 For better \add it is\add* that it be said to thee, Come up hither; than that thou shouldst be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thy eyes have seen. 
\v 8 Go not forth hastily to strive, lest \add thou know not\add* what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbor hath put thee to shame. 
\v 9 Debate thy cause with thy neighbor \add himself\add* ; and reveal not a secret to another: 
\v 10 Lest he that heareth \add it\add* put thee to shame, and thy infamy turn not away. 
\v 11 A word fitly spoken \add is like\add* apples of gold in pictures of silver. 
\v 12  \add As\add* an ear-ring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, \add so is\add* a wise reprover upon an obedient ear. 
\v 13 As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, \add so is\add* a faithful messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his masters. 
\v 14 Whoever boasteth himself of a false gift \add is like\add* clouds and wind without rain. 
\v 15 By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone. 
\v 16 Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled with it, and vomit it. 
\v 17 Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbor's house; lest he be weary of thee, and \add so\add* hate thee. 
\v 18 A man that beareth false witness against his neighbor \add is\add* a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow. 
\v 19 Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble \add is like\add* a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint. 
\v 20  \add As\add* he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, \add and as\add* vinegar upon nitre; so \add is\add* he that singeth songs to a heavy heart. 
\v 21 If thy enemy shall hunger, give him bread to eat; and if he shall thirst, give him water to drink: 
\v 22 For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD will reward thee. 
\v 23 The north wind driveth away rain: so \add doth\add* an angry countenance a backbiting tongue. 
\v 24  \add It is\add* better to dwell in a corner of the house-top, than with a brawling woman and in a wide house. 
\v 25  \add As\add* cold waters to a thirsty soul, so \add is\add* good news from a far country. 
\v 26 A righteous man falling down before the wicked \add is as\add* a turbid fountain, and a corrupt spring. 
\v 27  \add It is\add* not good to eat much honey: so \add for men\add* to search their own glory \add is not\add* glory. 
\v 28 He that \add hath\add* no rule over his own spirit \add is like\add* a city \add that is\add* broken down, \add and\add* without walls. 
\c 26  
\p
\v 1 As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest; so honor is not seemly for a fool. 
\v 2 As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come. 
\v 3 A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the fool's back. 
\v 4 Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like him. 
\v 5 Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit. 
\v 6 He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the feet, \add and\add* drinketh damage. 
\v 7 The legs of the lame are not equal: so \add is\add* a parable in the mouth of fools. 
\v 8 As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so \add is\add* he that giveth honor to a fool. 
\v 9  \add As\add* a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so \add is\add* a parable in the mouth of fools. 
\v 10 The great \add God\add* that formed all \add things\add* both rewardeth the fool, and rewardeth transgressors. 
\v 11 As a dog returneth to his vomit, \add so\add* a fool returneth to his folly. 
\v 12 Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? \add there is\add* more hope of a fool than of him. 
\v 13 The slothful \add man\add* saith, \add There is\add* a lion in the way; a lion \add is\add* in the streets. 
\v 14  \add As\add* the door turneth upon its hinges, so \add doth\add* the slothful upon his bed. 
\v 15 The slothful hideth \add his\add* hand in \add his\add* bosom; it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth. 
\v 16 The sluggard \add is\add* wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason. 
\v 17 He that passeth by, \add and\add* meddleth with strife \add belonging\add* not to him, \add is like\add* one that taketh a dog by the ears. 
\v 18 As a mad \add man\add* who casteth fire-brands, arrows, and death, 
\v 19 So \add is\add* the man \add that\add* deceiveth his neighbor, and saith, Am not I in sport? 
\v 20 Where no wood is, \add there\add* the fire goeth out: so where \add there is\add* no tale-bearer, the strife ceaseth. 
\v 21  \add As\add* coals \add are\add* to burning coals, and wood to fire; so \add is\add* a contentious man to kindle strife. 
\v 22 The words of a tale-bearer \add are\add* as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly. 
\v 23 Burning lips and a wicked heart \add are like\add* a potsherd covered with silver dross. 
\v 24 He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit within him; 
\v 25 When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for \add there are\add* seven abominations in his heart. 
\v 26  \add Whose\add* hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be shown before the \add whole\add* congregation. 
\v 27 Whoever diggeth a pit shall fall into it: and he that rolleth a stone, it will return upon him. 
\v 28 A lying tongue hateth \add those that are\add* afflicted by it; and a flattering mouth worketh ruin. 
\c 27  
\p
\v 1 Boast not thyself of to-morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth. 
\v 2 Let another man praise thee, and not thy own mouth; a stranger, and not thy own lips. 
\v 3 A stone \add is\add* heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool's wrath \add is\add* heavier than both. 
\v 4 Wrath \add is\add* cruel, and anger \add is\add* outrageous; but who \add is\add* able to stand before envy? 
\v 5 Open rebuke \add is\add* better than secret love. 
\v 6 Faithful \add are\add* the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy \add are\add* deceitful. 
\v 7 The full soul lotheth a honey-comb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet. 
\v 8 As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so \add is\add* a man that wandereth from his place. 
\v 9 Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so \add doth\add* the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel. 
\v 10 Thy own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not; neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity: \add for\add* better \add is\add* a neighbor \add that is\add* near, than a brother far off. 
\v 11 My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproacheth me. 
\v 12 A prudent \add man\add* foreseeth the evil, \add and\add* hideth himself; \add but\add* the simple pass on, \add and\add* are punished. 
\v 13 Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge of him for a strange woman. 
\v 14 He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him. 
\v 15 A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike. 
\v 16 Whoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his right hand \add which\add* bewrayeth \add itself\add* . 
\v 17 Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend. 
\v 18 He that keepeth the fig-tree shall eat the fruit of it: so he that waiteth on his master shall be honored. 
\v 19 As in water face \add answereth\add* to face, so the heart of man to man. 
\v 20 Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied. 
\v 21  \add As\add* the fining-pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so \add is\add* a man to his praise. 
\v 22 Though thou shouldst bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, \add yet\add* his foolishness will not depart from him. 
\v 23 Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, \add and\add* look well to thy herds. 
\v 24 For riches \add are\add* not for ever: and doth the crown \add endure\add* to every generation? 
\v 25 The plant appeareth, and the tender grass showeth itself, and herbs of the mountains are gathered. 
\v 26 The lambs \add are\add* for thy clothing, and the goats \add are\add* the price of the field. 
\v 27 And \add thou shalt have\add* goats milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household, and \add for\add* maintenance for thy maidens.

\v 1 The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion. 
\v 2 For the transgression of a land many \add are\add* its princes: but by a man of understanding \add and\add* knowledge the state \add thereof\add* shall be prolonged. 
\v 3 A poor man that oppresseth the poor \add is like\add* a sweeping rain which leaveth no food. 
\v 4 They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law contend with them. 
\v 5 Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the LORD understand all \add things\add* . 
\v 6 Better \add is\add* the poor that walketh in his uprightness, than \add he that is\add* perverse \add in his\add* ways, though he \add is\add* rich. 
\v 7 He who keepeth the law \add is\add* a wise son: but he that is a companion of riotous \add men\add* shameth his father. 
\v 8 He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor. 
\v 9 He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer \add shall be\add* abomination. 
\v 10 Whoever causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he shall fall himself into his own pit: but the upright shall have good \add things\add* in possession. 
\v 11 The rich man \add is\add* wise in his own conceit; but the poor man that hath understanding searcheth him out. 
\v 12 When righteous \add men\add* rejoice, \add there is\add* great glory: but when the wicked rise, a man is hidden. 
\v 13 He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but he who confesseth and forsaketh \add them\add* shall have mercy. 
\v 14 Happy \add is\add* the man that feareth always: but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief. 
\v 15  \add As\add* a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; \add so is\add* a wicked ruler over the poor people. 
\v 16 The prince that wanteth understanding \add is\add* also a great oppressor: \add but\add* he that hateth covetousness shall prolong \add his\add* days. 
\v 17 A man that doeth violence to the blood of \add any\add* person shall flee to the pit; let no man stay him. 
\v 18 He who walketh uprightly shall be saved: but \add he that is\add* perverse \add in his\add* ways shall fall at once. 
\v 19 He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: but he that followeth after vain \add persons\add* shall have poverty enough. 
\v 20 A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent. 
\v 21 To have respect of persons \add is\add* not good: for, for a piece of bread \add that\add* man will transgress. 
\v 22 He that hasteth to be rich \add hath\add* an evil eye, and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him. 
\v 23 He that rebuketh a man afterward shall find more favor than he that flattereth with the tongue. 
\v 24 He that robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, \add It is\add* no transgression; the same \add is\add* the companion of a destroyer. 
\v 25 He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fat. 
\v 26 He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoever walketh wisely, he shall be delivered. 
\v 27 He that giveth to the poor shall not want: but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse. 
\v 28 When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they perish, the righteous increase. 
\c 29  
\p
\v 1 He, that being often reproved hardeneth \add his\add* neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy. 
\v 2 When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn. 
\v 3 He that loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father: but he that keepeth company with harlots spendeth \add his\add* substance. 
\v 4 The king by judgment establisheth the land: but he that receiveth gifts overthroweth it. 
\v 5 A man that flattereth his neighbor spreadeth a net for his feet. 
\v 6 In the transgression of an evil man \add there is\add* a snare: but the righteous doth sing and rejoice. 
\v 7 The righteous considereth the cause of the poor: \add but\add* the wicked regardeth not to know \add it\add* . 
\v 8 Scornful men bring a city into a snare: but wise \add men\add* turn away wrath. 
\v 9  \add If\add* a wise man contendeth with a foolish man, whether he rageth or laugheth, \add there is\add* no rest. 
\v 10 The blood-thirsty hate the upright: but the just seek his soul. 
\v 11 A fool uttereth all his mind: but a wise \add man\add* keepeth it in till afterwards. 
\v 12 If a ruler hearkeneth to lies, all his servants \add are\add* wicked. 
\v 13 The poor and the deceitful man meet together: the LORD enlighteneth both their eyes. 
\v 14 The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall be established for ever. 
\v 15 The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left \add to himself\add* bringeth his mother to shame. 
\v 16 When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increaseth: but the righteous shall see their fall. 
\v 17 Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yes, he shall give delight to thy soul. 
\v 18 Where \add there is\add* no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy \add is\add* he. 
\v 19 A servant will not be corrected by words: for though he understandeth, he will not answer. 
\v 20 Seest thou a man \add that is\add* hasty in his words? \add there is\add* more hope of a fool than of him. 
\v 21 He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him at length become \add his\add* son. 
\v 22 An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth in transgression. 
\v 23 A man's pride shall bring him low: but honor shall uphold the humble in spirit. 
\v 24 Whoever is partner with a thief, hateth his own soul: he heareth cursing, and discloseth \add it\add* not. 
\v 25 The fear of man bringeth a snare: but he who putteth his trust in the LORD shall be safe. 
\v 26 Many seek the ruler's favor; but \add every\add* man's judgment \add cometh\add* from the LORD. 
\v 27 An unjust man \add is\add* an abomination to the just: and \add he that is\add* upright in the way \add is\add* abomination to the wicked.

\v 1 The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, \add even\add* the prophecy: the man spoke to Ithiel, even to Ithiel and Ucal, 
\v 2 Surely I \add am\add* more brutish than \add any\add* man, and have not the understanding of a man. 
\v 3 I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy. 
\v 4 Who hath ascended into heaven, or descended? who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what \add is\add* his name, and what \add is\add* his son's name, if thou canst tell? 
\v 5 Every word of God \add is\add* pure: he \add is\add* a shield to them that put their trust in him. 
\v 6 Add thou not to his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar. 
\v 7 Two \add things\add* have I required of thee; deny \add them\add* not to me before I die: 
\v 8 Remove far from me vanity and lies; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me: 
\v 9 Lest I be full, and deny \add thee\add* , and say, Who \add is\add* the LORD? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God \add in vain\add* . 
\v 10 Accuse not a servant to his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty. 
\v 11  \add There is\add* a generation \add that\add* curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother. 
\v 12  \add There is\add* a generation \add that are\add* pure in their own eyes, and \add yet\add* are not washed from their filthiness. 
\v 13  \add There is\add* a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up. 
\v 14  \add There is\add* a generation, whose teeth \add are as\add* swords, and their jaw-teeth \add as\add* knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from \add among\add* men. 
\v 15 The horse-leech hath two daughters, \add crying\add* , Give, give. There are three \add things that\add* are never satisfied, \add yes\add* , four \add things\add* say not, \add It is\add* enough: 
\v 16 The grave; and the barren womb; the earth \add that\add* is not filled with water; and the fire \add that\add* saith not, \add It is\add* enough. 
\v 17 The eye \add that\add* mocketh at \add its\add* father, and despiseth to obey \add its\add* mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it. 
\v 18 There are three \add things which\add* are too wonderful for me, yes, four which I know not: 
\v 19 The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid. 
\v 20 Such \add is\add* the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness. 
\v 21 For three \add things\add* the earth is disquieted, and for four \add which\add* it cannot bear: 
\v 22 For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with food. 
\v 23 For an odious \add woman\add* when she is married; and a handmaid that is heir to her mistress. 
\v 24 There are four \add things which are\add* little upon the earth, but they \add are\add* very wise: 
\v 25 The ants \add are\add* a people not strong, yet they prepare their food in the summer; 
\v 26 The conies \add are but\add* a feeble people, yet they make their houses in the rocks; 
\v 27 The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands; 
\v 28 The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in king's palaces. 
\v 29 There are three \add things\add* which go well, yes, four are comely in going: 
\v 30 A lion, \add which is\add* strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any; 
\v 31 A greyhound; a he-goat also; and a king, against whom \add there is\add* no rising up. 
\v 32 If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, \add lay\add* thy hand upon thy mouth. 
\v 33 Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.

\v 1 The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him. 
\v 2 What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows? 
\v 3 Give not thy strength to women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings. 
\v 4  \add It is\add* not for kings, O Lemuel, \add it is\add* not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink: 
\v 5 Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted. 
\v 6 Give strong drink to him that is ready to perish, and wine to those that are of heavy hearts. 
\v 7 Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more. 
\v 8 Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction. 
\v 9 Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy. 
\v 10 Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price \add is\add* far above rubies. 
\v 11 The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil. 
\v 12 She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life. 
\v 13 She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands. 
\v 14 She is like the merchant's ships; she bringeth her food from afar. 
\v 15 She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth food to her household, and a portion to her maidens. 
\v 16 She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard. 
\v 17 She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms. 
\v 18 She perceiveth that her merchandise \add is\add* good: her candle goeth not out by night. 
\v 19 She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff. 
\v 20 She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yes, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy. 
\v 21 She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household \add are\add* clothed with scarlet. 
\v 22 She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing \add is\add* silk and purple. 
\v 23 Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land. 
\v 24 She maketh fine linen, and selleth \add it\add* ; and delivereth girdles to the merchant. 
\v 25 Strength and honor \add are\add* her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come. 
\v 26 She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and on her tongue \add is\add* the law of kindness. 
\v 27 She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness. 
\v 28 Her children rise up, and call her blessed; her husband \add also\add* , and he praiseth her. 
\v 29 Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all. 
\v 30 Favor \add is\add* deceitful, and beauty \add is\add* vain: \add but\add* a woman \add that\add* feareth the LORD, she shall be praised. 
\v 31 Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.
