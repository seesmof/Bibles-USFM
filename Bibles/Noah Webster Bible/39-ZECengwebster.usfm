\v 1 In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD to Zechariah, the son of Barachiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying, 
\v 2 The LORD hath been greatly displeased with your fathers. 
\v 3 Therefore say thou to them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye to me, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will turn to you, saith the LORD of hosts. 
\v 4 Be ye not as your fathers, to whom the former prophets have cried, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye now from your evil ways, and \add from\add* your evil doings: but they did not hear, nor hearken to me, saith the LORD. 
\v 5 Your fathers, where \add are\add* they? and the prophets, do they live for ever? 
\v 6 But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they returned and said, As the LORD of hosts thought to do to us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so hath he dealt with us. 
\v 7 Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which \add is\add* the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD to Zechariah, the son of Barachiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying, 
\v 8 I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle-trees that \add were\add* in the bottom; and behind him \add were there\add* red horses, speckled, and white. 
\v 9 Then said I, O my LORD, what \add are these\add* ? And the angel that talked with me said to me, I will show thee what these \add are\add* . 
\v 10 And the man that stood among the myrtle-trees answered and said, These \add are they\add* whom the LORD hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth. 
\v 11 And they answered the angel of the LORD that stood among the myrtle-trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest. 
\v 12 Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these seventy years. 
\v 13 And the LORD answered the angel that talked with me \add with\add* good words \add and\add* comforting words. 
\v 14 So the angel that communed with me said to me, Cry thou, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy. 
\v 15 And I am very greatly displeased with the heathen \add that are\add* at ease: for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction. 
\v 16 Therefore thus saith the LORD; I have returned to Jerusalem with mercies: my house shall be built in it, saith the LORD of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem. 
\v 17 Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the LORD shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem. 
\v 18 Then I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold four horns. 
\v 19 And I said to the angel that talked with me, What \add are\add* these? And he answered me, These \add are\add* the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem. 
\v 20 And the LORD showed me four carpenters. 
\v 21 Then said I, What come these to do? And he spoke, saying, These \add are\add* the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man lifted up his head: but these are come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the Gentiles, which lifted \add their\add* horn over the land of Judah to scatter it. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 I lifted up my eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand. 
\v 2 Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said to me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what \add is\add* its breadth, and what \add is\add* its length. 
\v 3 And behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him, 
\v 4 And said to him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited \add as\add* towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle in it. 
\v 5 For I, saith the LORD, will be to her a wall of fire on every side, and will be the glory in the midst of her. 
\v 6 Ho, ho, \add come forth\add* , and flee from the land of the north, saith the LORD: for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, saith the LORD. 
\v 7 Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest \add with\add* the daughter of Babylon. 
\v 8 For thus saith the LORD of hosts; After the glory hath he sent me to the nations which wasted you: for he that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of his eye. 
\v 9 For behold, I will shake my hand upon them, and they shall be a spoil to their servants: and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me. 
\v 10 Sing, and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the LORD. 
\v 11 And many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day, and shall be my people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me to thee. 
\v 12 And the LORD shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land, and shall choose Jerusalem again. 
\v 13 Be silent, O all flesh, before the LORD: for he is raised up out of his holy habitation. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him. 
\v 2 And the LORD said to Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan; even the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: \add is\add* not this a brand plucked out of the fire? 
\v 3 Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel. 
\v 4 And he answered and spoke to those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And to him he said, Behold, I have caused thy iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment. 
\v 5 And I said, Let them set a fair miter upon his head. So they set a fair miter upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the LORD stood by. 
\v 6 And the angel of the LORD protested to Joshua, saying, 
\v 7 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by. 
\v 8 Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou and thy fellows that sit before thee: for they \add are\add* men wondered at: for behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH. 
\v 9 For behold, the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone \add shall be\add* seven eyes; behold, I will engrave the graving of it saith the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day. 
\v 10 In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall ye call every man his neighbor under the vine and under the fig-tree. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep, 
\v 2 And said to me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick: all \add of\add* gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and its seven lamps, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which \add were\add* upon the top of it. 
\v 3 And two olive-trees by it, one upon the right \add side\add* of the bowl, and the other upon the left \add side\add* . 
\v 4 So I answered and spoke to the angel that talked with me, saying, What \add are\add* these, my lord? 
\v 5 Then the angel that talked with me answered and said to me, Knowest thou not what these are? and I said, No, my lord. 
\v 6 Then he answered and spoke to me, saying, This \add is\add* the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts. 
\v 7 Who \add art\add* thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel \add thou shalt become\add* a plain: and he shall bring forth \add its\add* head-stone \add with\add* shoutings, \add crying\add* , Grace, grace, to it. 
\v 8 Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 
\v 9 The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me to you. 
\v 10 For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel \add with\add* those seven; they \add are\add* the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth. 
\v 11 Then I answered, and said to him, What \add are\add* these two olive-trees upon the right \add side\add* of the candlestick and upon its left \add side\add* ? 
\v 12 And I answered again, and said to him, What \add are these\add* two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden \add oil\add* out of themselves? 
\v 13 And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these \add are\add* ? And I said, No, my lord. 
\v 14 Then said he, These \add are\add* the two anointed ones, that stand by the LORD of the whole earth. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 Then I turned, and lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold a flying roll. 
\v 2 And he said to me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a flying roll; its length \add is\add* twenty cubits, and its breadth ten cubits. 
\v 3 Then said he to me, This \add is\add* the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth: for every one that stealeth shall be cut off \add as\add* on this side according to it; and every one that sweareth shall be cut off \add as\add* on that side according to it. 
\v 4 I will bring it forth, saith the LORD of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name: and it shall remain in the midst of his house, and shall consume it with its timber and its stones. 
\v 5 Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said to me, Lift up now thy eyes, and see what \add is\add* this that goeth forth. 
\v 6 And I said, What \add is\add* it? And he said, This \add is\add* an ephah that goeth forth. He said moreover, This \add is\add* their resemblance through all the earth. 
\v 7 And behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead: and this \add is\add* a woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah. 
\v 8 And he said, This \add is\add* wickedness. And he cast it into the midst of the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon its mouth. 
\v 9 Then I lifted up my eyes, and looked and behold, there came out two women, and the wind \add was\add* in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a stork: and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven. 
\v 10 Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Whither do these bear the ephah? 
\v 11 And he said to me, To build for it a house in the land of Shinar: and it shall be established, and set there upon her own base. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1 And I turned, and lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains \add were\add* mountains of brass. 
\v 2 In the first chariot \add were\add* red horses; and in the second chariot black horses; 
\v 3 And in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grizzled and bay horses. 
\v 4 Then I answered and said to the angel that talked with me, What \add are\add* these, my lord? 
\v 5 And the angel answered and said to me, These \add are\add* the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth. 
\v 6 The black horses which \add are\add* therein go forth into the north country; and the white go forth after them; and the grizzled go forth towards the south country. 
\v 7 And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Go hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth. 
\v 8 Then he cried upon me, and spoke to me, saying, Behold, these that go towards the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country. 
\v 9 And the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 
\v 10 Take of \add them of\add* the captivity, \add even\add* of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, who are come from Babylon, and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah; 
\v 11 Then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set \add them\add* upon the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest. 
\v 12 And speak to him, saying, Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name \add is\add* The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD; 
\v 13 Even he shall build the temple of the LORD; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne: and he shall be a priest upon his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them both. 
\v 14 And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of the LORD. 
\v 15 And they \add that are\add* far off shall come and build in the temple of the LORD, and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me to you. And \add this\add* shall come to pass, if ye will diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, \add that\add* the word of the LORD came to Zechariah in the fourth \add day\add* of the ninth month, \add even\add* in Chisleu; 
\v 2 When they had sent to the house of God Sherezer and Regem-melech, and their men, to pray before the LORD, 
\v 3  \add And\add* to speak to the priests who \add were\add* in the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years? 
\v 4 Then came the word of the LORD of hosts to me, saying, 
\v 5 Speak to all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh \add month\add* , even those seventy years, did ye at all fast to me, \add even\add* to me? 
\v 6 And when ye ate, and when ye drank, did ye not eat \add for yourselves\add* , and drink \add for yourselves\add* ? 
\v 7  \add Should ye\add* not \add hear\add* the words which the LORD hath cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and her cities around her, when \add men\add* inhabited the south and the plain? 
\v 8 And the word of the LORD came to Zechariah, saying, 
\v 9 Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Execute true judgment, and show mercy and compassions every man to his brother: 
\v 10 And oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart. 
\v 11 But they refused to hearken, and withdrew the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they should not hear. 
\v 12 Yes, they made their hearts \add as\add* an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which the LORD of hosts hath sent in his spirit by the former prophets: therefore came a great wrath from the LORD of hosts. 
\v 13 Therefore it is come to pass, \add that\add* as he cried, and they would not hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the LORD of hosts: 
\v 14 But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them, that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1 Again the word of the LORD of hosts came \add to me\add* , saying, 
\v 2 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I was jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I was jealous for her with great fury. 
\v 3 Thus saith the LORD; I have returned to Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth; and the mountain of the LORD of hosts the holy mountain. 
\v 4 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every man with his staff in his hand for very age. 
\v 5 And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in its streets. 
\v 6 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If it is marvelous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days, should it also be marvelous in my eyes? saith the LORD of hosts. 
\v 7 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will save my people from the east country, and from the west country; 
\v 8 And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness. 
\v 9 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets, who \add were\add* in the day \add when\add* the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, that the temple might be built. 
\v 10 For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; neither \add was there any\add* peace to him that went out or came in because of the affliction: for I set all men every one against his neighbor. 
\v 11 But now I \add will\add* not \add be\add* to the residue of this people as in the former days, saith the LORD of hosts. 
\v 12 For the seed \add shall be\add* prosperous; the vine shall give her fruit, and the ground shall give her increase, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these \add things\add* . 
\v 13 And it shall come to pass, \add that\add* as ye were a curse among the heathen, O house of Judah, and house of Israel; so will I save you, and ye shall be a blessing: fear not, let your hands be strong. 
\v 14 For thus saith the LORD of hosts; As I thought to punish you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath, saith the LORD of hosts, and I repented not; 
\v 15 So again have I thought in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: fear ye not. 
\v 16 These \add are\add* the things that ye shall do; Speak ye every man the truth to his neighbor; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates: 
\v 17 And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbor; and love no false oath: for all these \add are things\add* that I hate, saith the LORD. 
\v 18 And the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, 
\v 19 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The fast of the fourth \add month\add* , and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts; therefore love the truth and peace. 
\v 20 Thus saith the LORD of hosts: \add It shall\add* yet \add come to pass\add* , that there shall come people, and the inhabitants of many cities: 
\v 21 And the inhabitants of one \add city\add* shall go to another, saying, Let us go speedily to pray before the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts: I will go also. 
\v 22 And many people and strong nations shall come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem, and to pray before the LORD. 
\v 23 Thus saith the LORD of hosts: In those days \add it shall come to pass\add* , that ten men out of all languages of the nations, shall take hold, shall even take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you: for we have heard \add that\add* God \add is\add* with you. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 The burden of the word of the LORD in the land of Hadrach, and Damascus \add shall be\add* the rest of it: when the eyes of man, as of all the tribes of Israel, \add shall be\add* towards the LORD. 
\v 2 And Hamath also shall border by it; Tyre and Zidon, though it be very wise. 
\v 3 And Tyre built herself a strong hold, and amassed silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets. 
\v 4 Behold, the LORD will cast her out, and he will smite her power in the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire. 
\v 5 Ashkelon shall see \add it\add* , and fear; Gaza also \add shall see it\add* , and be very sorrowful, and Ekron; for her expectation shall be ashamed; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited. 
\v 6 And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines. 
\v 7 And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth: but he that remaineth, even he, \add shall be\add* for our God, and he shall be as a governor in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite. 
\v 8 And I will encamp about my house because of the army, because of him that passeth by, and because of him that returneth: and no oppressor shall pass through them any more: for now have I seen with my eyes. 
\v 9 Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh to thee: he \add is\add* just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass. 
\v 10 And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle-bow shall be cut off: and he shall speak peace to the heathen: and his dominion \add shall be\add* from sea to sea, and from the river to the ends of the earth. 
\v 11 As for thee also, by the blood of thy covenant I have sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit in which \add is\add* no water. 
\v 12 Turn ye to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope: even to-day do I declare \add that\add* I will render double to thee; 
\v 13 When I have bent Judah for me, filled the bow with Ephraim, and raised up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and made thee as the sword of a mighty man. 
\v 14 And the LORD shall be seen over them, and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning: and the Lord GOD will blow the trumpet, and will go with whirlwinds of the south. 
\v 15 The LORD of hosts will defend them; and they shall devour, and subdue with sling-stones; and they shall drink, \add and\add* make a noise as through wine; and they shall be filled like bowls, \add and\add* as the corners of the altar. 
\v 16 And the LORD their God will save them in that day as the flock of his people: for \add they shall be as\add* the stones of a crown, lifted up as an ensign upon his land. 
\v 17 For how great \add is\add* his goodness, and how great \add is\add* his beauty! corn shall make the young men cheerful, and new wine the maids. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1 Ask ye of the LORD rain in the time of the latter rain; \add so\add* the LORD will make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field. 
\v 2 For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain: therefore they went their way as a flock, they were troubled because \add there was\add* no shepherd. 
\v 3 My anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished the goats: for the LORD of hosts hath visited his flock the house of Judah, and hath made them as his goodly horse in the battle. 
\v 4 Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the nail, out of him the battle-bow, out of him every oppressor together. 
\v 5 And they shall be as mighty \add men\add* , who tread down \add their enemies\add* in the mire of the streets in the battle: and they shall fight, because the LORD \add is\add* with them, and the riders on horses shall be confounded. 
\v 6 And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will bring them again to place them; for I have mercy upon them: and they shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I \add am\add* the LORD their God, and will hear them. 
\v 7 And \add they of\add* Ephraim shall be like a mighty \add man\add* , and their heart shall rejoice as through wine: yes, their children shall see \add it\add* , and be glad; their heart shall rejoice in the LORD. 
\v 8 I will hiss for them, and gather them: for I have redeemed them: and they shall increase as they have increased. 
\v 9 And I will sow them among the people: and they shall remember me in remote countries; and they shall live with their children, and turn again. 
\v 10 I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon; and \add place\add* shall not be found for them. 
\v 11 And he shall pass through the sea with affliction, and shall smite the waves in the sea, and all the deeps of the river shall dry up: and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the scepter of Egypt shall depart. 
\v 12 And I will strengthen them in the LORD; and they shall walk up and down in his name, saith the LORD. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars. 
\v 2 Howl, fir-tree, for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty are laid waste: howl, O ye oaks of Bashan; for the forest of the vintage is come down. 
\v 3  \add There is\add* a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their glory is destroyed: a voice of the roaring of young lions; for the pride of Jordan is laid waste. 
\v 4 Thus saith the LORD my God; Feed the flock of the slaughter; 
\v 5 Whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty: and they that sell them say, Blessed \add be\add* the LORD; for I am rich: and their own shepherds pity them not. 
\v 6 For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD: but lo, I will deliver the men every one into his neighbor's hand, and into the hand of his king: and they shall smite the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver \add them\add* . 
\v 7 And I will feed the flock of slaughter, \add even\add* you, O poor of the flock. And I took to me two staffs; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock. 
\v 8 Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul lothed them, and their soul also abhorred me. 
\v 9 Then said I, I will not feed you: that which dieth, let it die; and that which is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat, every one the flesh of another. 
\v 10 And I took my staff, \add even\add* Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the people. 
\v 11 And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it \add was\add* the word of the LORD. 
\v 12 And I said to them, If ye think good, give \add me\add* my price; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty \add pieces\add* of silver. 
\v 13 And the LORD said to me, Cast it to the potter: a goodly price that I was prized at by them. And I took the thirty \add pieces\add* of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD. 
\v 14 Then I cut asunder my other staff, \add even\add* Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel. 
\v 15 And the LORD said to me, Take to thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd. 
\v 16 For lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, \add who\add* shall not visit those that are cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor heal that which is broken, nor feed that which standeth still: but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their claws in pieces. 
\v 17 Woe to the idle shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword \add shall be\add* upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be wholly dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 The burden of the word of the LORD for Israel, saith the LORD, who stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him. 
\v 2 Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling to all the people around, when they shall be in the siege both against Judah \add and\add* against Jerusalem. 
\v 3 And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the earth be assembled against it. 
\v 4 In that day, saith the LORD, I will smite every horse with astonishment, and his rider with madness: and I will open my eyes upon the house of Judah, and will smite every horse of the people with blindness. 
\v 5 And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, The inhabitants of Jerusalem \add shall be\add* my strength in the LORD of hosts their God. 
\v 6 In that day will I make the governors of Judah like a hearth of fire among the wood, and like a torch of fire in a sheaf; and they shall devour all the people around, on the right hand and on the left: and Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place, \add even\add* in Jerusalem. 
\v 7 The LORD also will save the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem may not magnify \add themselves\add* against Judah. 
\v 8 In that day will the LORD defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David; and the house of David \add shall be\add* as God, as the angel of the LORD before them. 
\v 9 And it shall come to pass in that day, \add that\add* I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. 
\v 10 And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for \add his\add* only \add son\add* , and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for \add his\add* first-born. 
\v 11 In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon. 
\v 12 And the land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart; 
\v 13 The family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of Shimei apart, and their wives apart; 
\v 14 All the families that remain, every family apart, and their wives apart.

\v 1 In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness. 
\v 2 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, \add that\add* I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered: and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land. 
\v 3 And it shall come to pass, \add that\add* when any shall yet prophesy, then his father and his mother that begat him shall say to him, Thou shalt not live; for thou speakest lies in the name of the LORD: and his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth. 
\v 4 And it shall come to pass in that day, \add that\add* the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision, when he hath prophesied; neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive: 
\v 5 But he shall say, I \add am\add* no prophet, I \add am\add* a husbandman; for man taught me to keep cattle from my youth. 
\v 6 And \add one\add* shall say to him, What \add are\add* these wounds in thy hands? Then he shall answer, \add Those\add* with which I was wounded \add in\add* the house of my friends. 
\v 7 Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man \add that is\add* my fellow, saith the LORD of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered: and I will turn my hand upon the little ones. 
\v 8 And it shall come to pass, \add that\add* in all the land, saith the LORD, two parts therein shall be cut off \add and\add* die; but the third shall be left therein. 
\v 9 And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It \add is\add* my people; and they shall say, The LORD \add is\add* my God.

\v 1 Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, and thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee. 
\v 2 For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city. 
\v 3 Then will the LORD go forth, and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle. 
\v 4 And his feet will stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which \add is\add* before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst of it towards the east and towards the west, \add and there shall be\add* a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove towards the north, and half of it towards the south. 
\v 5 And ye shall flee \add to\add* the valley of the mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach to Azal: yes, ye shall flee as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah: and the LORD my God shall come, \add and\add* all the saints with thee. 
\v 6 And it shall come to pass in that day, \add that\add* the light shall not be clear, \add nor\add* dark: 
\v 7 But it shall be one day which shall be known to the LORD, not day, nor night: but it shall come to pass, \add that\add* at evening it shall be light. 
\v 8 And it shall be in that day, \add that\add* living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them towards the former sea, and half of them towards the hinder sea: in summer and in winter shall it be. 
\v 9 And the LORD will be king over all the earth: in that day will there be one LORD, and his name one. 
\v 10 All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon, south of Jerusalem: and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her place, from Benjamin's gate to the place of the first gate, to the corner gate, and \add from\add* the tower of Hananeel to the king's wine-presses. 
\v 11 And \add men\add* shall dwell in it, and there shall be no more utter destruction; but Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited. 
\v 12 And this shall be the plague with which the LORD will smite all the people that have fought against Jerusalem; Their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth. 
\v 13 And it shall come to pass in that day, \add that\add* a great tumult from the LORD shall be among them; and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbor, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbor. 
\v 14 And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the heathen around shall be collected, gold, and silver, and apparel, in great abundance. 
\v 15 And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that shall be in these tents, as this plague. 
\v 16 And it shall come to pass, \add that\add* every one that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles. 
\v 17 And it shall be, \add that\add* whoever will not come up of \add all\add* the families of the earth to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, even upon them shall be no rain. 
\v 18 And if the family of Egypt shall not go up, and shall not come, that \add have\add* no \add rain\add* ; there shall be the plague, with which the LORD will smite the heathen that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles. 
\v 19 This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles. 
\v 20 In that day there shall be upon the bells of the horses, HOLINESS TO THE LORD; and the pots in the LORD'S house shall be like the bowls before the altar. 
\v 21 Yes, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness to the LORD of hosts: and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them, and seethe in them: and in that day there shall be no more the Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts.
