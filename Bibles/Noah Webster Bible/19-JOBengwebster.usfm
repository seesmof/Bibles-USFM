\p
\v 1 There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name \add was\add* Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and shunned evil. 
\v 2 And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters. 
\v 3 His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east. 
\v 4 And his sons went and feasted \add in their\add* houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them. 
\v 5 And it was so, when the days of \add their\add* feasting were ended, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose early in the morning, and offered burnt-offerings \add according\add* to the number of them all; for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually. 
\v 6 Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them. 
\v 7 And the LORD said to Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down upon it. 
\v 8 And the LORD said to Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that \add there is\add* none like him on the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and shunneth evil? 
\v 9 Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for naught? 
\v 10 Hast not thou made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land. 
\v 11 But put forth thy hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face. 
\v 12 And the LORD said to Satan, Behold, all that he hath \add is\add* in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thy hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD. 
\v 13 And there was a day when his sons and his daughters \add were\add* eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house: 
\v 14 And there came a messenger to Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them: 
\v 15 And the Sabeans fell \add upon them\add* , and took them away; yes, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only have escaped alone to tell thee. 
\v 16 While he \add was\add* yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God hath fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and I only have escaped alone to tell thee. 
\v 17 While he \add was\add* yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yes, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only have escaped alone to tell thee. 
\v 18 While he \add was\add* yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters \add were\add* eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house: 
\v 19 And behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only have escaped alone to tell thee. 
\v 20 Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell upon the ground, and worshiped, 
\v 21 And said, Naked came I from my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: The LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD. 
\v 22 In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD. 
\v 2 And the LORD said to Satan, Whence comest thou? and Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down upon it. 
\v 3 And the LORD said to Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that \add there is\add* none like him on the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and shunneth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause. 
\v 4 And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, even, all that a man hath will he give for his life. 
\v 5 But put forth thy hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face. 
\v 6 And the LORD said to Satan, Behold, he \add is\add* in thy hand; but save his life. 
\v 7 So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot to his crown. 
\v 8 And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself with \add it\add* ; and he sat down among the ashes. 
\v 9 Then said his wife to him, Dost thou still retain thy integrity? curse God, and die. 
\v 10 But he said to her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips. 
\v 11 Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that had come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him, and to comfort him. 
\v 12 And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they raised their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads towards heaven. 
\v 13 So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spoke a word to him: for they saw that \add his\add* grief was very great. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 After this Job opened his mouth, and cursed his day. 
\v 2 And Job spoke, and said, 
\v 3 Let the day perish in which I was born, and the night \add in which\add* it was said, There is a man child conceived. 
\v 4 Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it. 
\v 5 Let darkness and the shades of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it. 
\v 6 As \add for\add* that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined to the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months. 
\v 7 Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein. 
\v 8 Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning. 
\v 9 Let the stars of its twilight be dark; let it look for light, but \add have\add* none; neither let it see the dawning of the day: 
\v 10 Because it prevented not my birth, nor hid sorrow from my eyes. 
\v 11 Why died I not from the womb? \add why\add* did I \add not\add* expire at the time of my birth? 
\v 12 Why did the knees receive me? or why the breasts that I should be nursed? 
\v 13 For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest, 
\v 14 With kings and counselors of the earth, who built desolate places for themselves; 
\v 15 Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver: 
\v 16 Or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants \add which\add* never saw light. 
\v 17 There the wicked cease \add from\add* troubling; and there the weary are at rest. 
\v 18  \add There\add* the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor. 
\v 19 The small and great are there; and the servant \add is\add* free from his master. 
\v 20 Why is light given to him that is in misery, and life to the bitter \add in\add* soul; 
\v 21 Who long for death, but it \add cometh\add* not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures; 
\v 22 Who rejoice exceedingly, \add and\add* are glad, when they can find the grave? 
\v 23  \add Why is light given\add* to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in? 
\v 24 For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters. 
\v 25 For the thing which I greatly feared hath come upon me, and that which I dreaded hath come to me. 
\v 26 I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, 
\v 2  \add If\add* we essay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can refrain from speaking? 
\v 3 Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands. 
\v 4 Thy words have upheld him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees. 
\v 5 But now it hath come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled. 
\v 6  \add Is\add* not \add this\add* thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways? 
\v 7 Remember, I pray thee, who \add ever\add* perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off; 
\v 8 Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same. 
\v 9 By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed. 
\v 10 The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken. 
\v 11 The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad. 
\v 12 Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and my ear received a small sound of it. 
\v 13 In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men. 
\v 14 Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake. 
\v 15 Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up: 
\v 16 It stood still, but I could not discern its form: an image \add was\add* before my eyes, \add there was\add* silence, and I heard a voice, \add saying\add* , 
\v 17 Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker? 
\v 18 Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly: 
\v 19 How much less \add in\add* them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation \add is\add* in the dust, \add who\add* are crushed before the moth? 
\v 20 They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding \add it\add* . 
\v 21 Doth not their excellence \add which is\add* in them depart? they die, even without wisdom. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 Call now, if there is any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn? 
\v 2 For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one. 
\v 3 I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation. 
\v 4 His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither \add is there\add* any to deliver \add them\add* . 
\v 5 Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance. 
\v 6 Although affliction cometh not forth from the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground; 
\v 7 Yet man is born to trouble, as the sparks fly upward. 
\v 8 I would seek to God, and to God would I commit my cause: 
\v 9 Who doeth great things and unsearchable; wonderful things without number: 
\v 10 Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields: 
\v 11 To set on high those that are low: that those who mourn may be exalted to safety. 
\v 12 He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform \add their\add* enterprise. 
\v 13 He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong. 
\v 14 They meet with darkness in the day-time, and grope in the noon-day as in the night. 
\v 15 But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty. 
\v 16 So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth. 
\v 17 Behold, happy \add is\add* the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty: 
\v 18 For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole. 
\v 19 He will deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee. 
\v 20 In famine he will redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of the sword. 
\v 21 Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh. 
\v 22 At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth. 
\v 23 For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee. 
\v 24 And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle \add will be\add* in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin. 
\v 25 Thou shalt know also that thy seed \add will be\add* great, and thy offspring as the grass of the earth. 
\v 26 Thou shalt come to \add thy\add* grave in a full age, as a shock of corn cometh in in its season. 
\v 27 Lo this, we have searched it, so it \add is\add* ; hear it, and know thou \add it\add* for thy good. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1 But Job answered and said, 
\v 2 Oh that my grief were thoroughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together! 
\v 3 For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up. 
\v 4 For the arrows of the Almighty \add are\add* within me, the poison of which drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God set themselves in array against me. 
\v 5 Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder? 
\v 6 Can that which is unsavory be eaten without salt? or is there \add any\add* taste in the white of an egg? 
\v 7 The things \add that\add* my soul refused to touch \add are\add* as my sorrowful food. 
\v 8 Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant \add me\add* the thing that I long for! 
\v 9 Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off! 
\v 10 Then should I yet have comfort; yes, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One. 
\v 11 What \add is\add* my strength, that I should hope? and what \add is\add* my end, that I should prolong my life? 
\v 12  \add Is\add* my strength the strength of stones? or \add is\add* my flesh of brass? 
\v 13  \add Is\add* not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me? 
\v 14 To him that is afflicted pity \add should be shown\add* from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty. 
\v 15 My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, \add and\add* as the stream of brooks they pass away; 
\v 16 Which are blackish by reason of the ice, \add and\add* in which the snow is hid: 
\v 17 In the time when they become warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place. 
\v 18 The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish. 
\v 19 The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them. 
\v 20 They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed. 
\v 21 For now ye are nothing: ye see \add my\add* casting down, and are afraid. 
\v 22 Did I say, Bring to me? or Give a reward for me of your substance? 
\v 23 Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty? 
\v 24 Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand in what I have erred. 
\v 25 How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove? 
\v 26 Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, \add which are\add* as wind? 
\v 27 Yes, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig \add a pit\add* for your friend. 
\v 28 Now therefore be content, look upon me; for \add it is\add* evident to you if I lie. 
\v 29 Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yes, return again, my righteousness \add is\add* in it. 
\v 30 Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things? 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1  \add Is there\add* not an appointed time to man upon earth? \add are not\add* his days also like the days of a hireling? 
\v 2 As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as a hireling looketh for \add the reward of\add* his work; 
\v 3 So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me. 
\v 4 When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro to the dawning of the day. 
\v 5 My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken and become lothsome. 
\v 6 My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope. 
\v 7 O remember that my life \add is\add* wind: my eye will no more see good. 
\v 8 The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no \add more\add* : thy eyes \add are\add* upon me, and I \add am\add* not. 
\v 9  \add As\add* the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no \add more\add* . 
\v 10 He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more. 
\v 11 Therefore I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul. 
\v 12  \add Am\add* I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me? 
\v 13 When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint; 
\v 14 Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions: 
\v 15 So that my soul chooseth strangling, \add and\add* death rather than my life. 
\v 16 I lothe \add it\add* ; I would not live always: let me alone; for my days \add are\add* vanity. 
\v 17 What \add is\add* man, that thou shouldst magnify him? and that thou shouldst set thy heart upon him? 
\v 18 And \add that\add* thou shouldst visit him every morning, \add and\add* try him every moment? 
\v 19 How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow my spittle? 
\v 20 I have sinned; what shall I do to thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself? 
\v 21 And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away my iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I \add shall\add* not \add be\add* . 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 
\v 2 How long wilt thou speak these \add things\add* ? and \add how long shall\add* the words of thy mouth \add be like\add* a strong wind? 
\v 3 Doth God pervert judgment; or doth the Almighty pervert justice? 
\v 4 If thy children have sinned against him, and he hath cast them away for their transgression; 
\v 5 If thou wouldst seek to God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty; 
\v 6 If thou \add wert\add* pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous. 
\v 7 Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end would greatly increase. 
\v 8 For inquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers: 
\v 9 (For we \add are but of\add* yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth \add are\add* a shadow:) 
\v 10 Will they not teach thee, \add and\add* tell thee, and utter words out of their heart? 
\v 11 Can the rush grow without mire? can the flag grow without water? 
\v 12 Whilst it \add is\add* yet in its greenness, \add and\add* not cut down, it withereth before any \add other\add* herb. 
\v 13 So \add are\add* the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish: 
\v 14 Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust \add shall be\add* a spider's web. 
\v 15 He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure. 
\v 16 He \add is\add* green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden. 
\v 17 His roots are wrapped about the heap, \add and\add* seeth the place of stones. 
\v 18 If he shall destroy him from his place, then \add it\add* shall deny him, \add saying\add* , I have not seen thee. 
\v 19 Behold, this \add is\add* the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow. 
\v 20 Behold, God will not cast away a perfect \add man\add* , neither will he help the evil doers: 
\v 21 Till he shall fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing. 
\v 22 They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to naught. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 Then Job answered and said, 
\v 2 I know \add it to be\add* so of a truth: but how should man be just with God? 
\v 3 If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand. 
\v 4  \add He is\add* wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened \add himself\add* against him, and hath prospered? 
\v 5 Who removeth the mountains, and they know not: who overturneth them in his anger. 
\v 6 Who shaketh the earth out of her place, and its pillars tremble. 
\v 7 Who commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars. 
\v 8 Who alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea. 
\v 9 Who maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south. 
\v 10 Who doeth great things past finding out; yes, and wonders without number. 
\v 11 Lo, he goeth by me, and I see \add him\add* not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not. 
\v 12 Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say to him, What doest thou? 
\v 13  \add If\add* God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him. 
\v 14 How much less shall I answer him, \add and\add* choose out my words \add to reason\add* with him? 
\v 15 Whom, though I were righteous, \add yet\add* would I not answer, \add but\add* I would make supplication to my judge. 
\v 16 If I had called, and he had answered me; \add yet\add* I would not believe that he had hearkened to my voice. 
\v 17 For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause. 
\v 18 He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness. 
\v 19 If \add I speak\add* of strength, lo, \add he is\add* strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time \add to plead\add* ? 
\v 20 If I justify myself, my own mouth will condemn me: \add if I say\add* , I \add am\add* perfect, that also will prove me perverse. 
\v 21  \add Though\add* I \add were\add* perfect, \add yet\add* would I not know my soul: I would despise my life. 
\v 22 This \add is\add* one \add thing\add* , therefore I said \add it\add* , he destroyeth the perfect and the wicked. 
\v 23 If the scourge shall slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent. 
\v 24 The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of its judges; if not, where, \add and\add* who \add is\add* he? 
\v 25 Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good. 
\v 26 They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle \add that\add* hasteth to the prey. 
\v 27 If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort \add myself\add* : 
\v 28 I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent. 
\v 29  \add If\add* I am wicked, why then do I labor in vain? 
\v 30 If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean; 
\v 31 Yet wilt thou plunge me in the ditch, and my own clothes shall abhor me. 
\v 32 For \add he is\add* not a man, as I \add am\add* , \add that\add* I should answer him, \add and\add* we should come together in judgment. 
\v 33 Neither is there any judge between us, \add that\add* might lay his hand upon us both. 
\v 34 Let him take away his rod from me, and let not his fear terrify me: 
\v 35  \add Then\add* would I speak, and not fear him; but \add it is\add* not so with me. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1 My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul. 
\v 2 I will say to God, Do not condemn me; show me why thou contendest with me. 
\v 3  \add Is it\add* good to thee that thou shouldst oppress, that thou shouldst despise the work of thy hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked? 
\v 4 Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth? 
\v 5  \add Are\add* thy days as the days of man? \add are\add* thy years as man's days, 
\v 6 That thou inquirest after my iniquity, and searchest after my sin? 
\v 7 Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and \add there is\add* none that can deliver out of thy hand. 
\v 8 Thy hands have made me and fashioned me in all my parts; yet thou dost destroy me. 
\v 9 Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again? 
\v 10 Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese? 
\v 11 Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews. 
\v 12 Thou hast granted me life and favor, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit. 
\v 13 And these \add things\add* hast thou hid in thy heart: I know that this \add is\add* with thee. 
\v 14 If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from my iniquity. 
\v 15 If I be wicked, woe to me; and \add if\add* I be righteous, \add yet\add* will I not lift up my head. \add I am\add* full of confusion; therefore see thou my affliction; 
\v 16 For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou showest thyself wonderful upon me. 
\v 17 Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thy indignation upon me; changes and war \add are\add* against me. 
\v 18 Why then hast thou brought me forth from the womb? O that I had expired, and no eye had seen me! 
\v 19 I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave. 
\v 20  \add Are\add* not my days few? cease \add then\add* , \add and\add* let me alone, that I may take comfort a little, 
\v 21 Before I go \add whence\add* I shall not return, \add even\add* to the land of darkness, and the shades of death; 
\v 22 A land of darkness, as darkness \add itself\add* ; \add and\add* of the shades of death, without any order, and \add where\add* the light \add is\add* as darkness. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, 
\v 2 Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified? 
\v 3 Should thy falsehoods make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed? 
\v 4 For thou hast said, My doctrine \add is\add* pure, and I am clean in thy eyes. 
\v 5 But Oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee; 
\v 6 And that he would show thee the secrets of wisdom, that \add they are\add* double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee \add less\add* than thy iniquity \add deserveth\add* . 
\v 7 Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty to perfection? 
\v 8  \add It is\add* as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know? 
\v 9 The measure of it \add is\add* longer than the earth, and broader than the sea. 
\v 10 If he shall cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him? 
\v 11 For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider \add it\add* ? 
\v 12 For vain man would be wise, though man is born \add like\add* a wild ass's colt. 
\v 13 If thou preparest thy heart, and stretchest out thy hands towards him; 
\v 14 If iniquity \add is\add* in thy hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles. 
\v 15 For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yes, thou shalt be steadfast, and shalt not fear: 
\v 16 Because thou shalt forget \add thy\add* misery, \add and\add* remember \add it\add* as waters \add that\add* pass away: 
\v 17 And \add thy\add* age shall be clearer than the noon-day: thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning. 
\v 18 And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yes, thou shalt dig \add about thee\add* , \add and\add* thou shalt take thy rest in safety. 
\v 19 Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make \add thee\add* afraid; yes, many shall make suit to thee. 
\v 20 But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope \add shall be as\add* the expiration of the breath. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 And Job answered and said, 
\v 2 No doubt but ye \add are\add* the people, and wisdom shall die with you. 
\v 3 But I have understanding as well as you; I \add am\add* not inferior to you: yes, who knoweth not such things as these? 
\v 4 I am \add as\add* one mocked by his neighbor, who calleth upon God, and he answereth him: the just upright \add man is\add* derided. 
\v 5 He that is ready to slip with \add his\add* feet \add is as\add* a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease. 
\v 6 The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth \add abundantly\add* . 
\v 7 But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee: 
\v 8 Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare to thee. 
\v 9 Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this? 
\v 10 In whose hand \add is\add* the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind. 
\v 11 Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste its food? 
\v 12 With the ancient \add is\add* wisdom; and in length of days understanding. 
\v 13 With him \add is\add* wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding. 
\v 14 Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening. 
\v 15 Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth. 
\v 16 With him \add is\add* strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver \add are\add* his. 
\v 17 He leadeth counselors away spoiled, and maketh the judges fools. 
\v 18 He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle. 
\v 19 He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty. 
\v 20 He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged. 
\v 21 He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of the mighty. 
\v 22 He revealeth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth to light the shades of death. 
\v 23 He increaseth nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth nations, and straiteneth them \add again\add* . 
\v 24 He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness \add where there is\add* no way. 
\v 25 They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like \add a\add* drunken \add man\add* . 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 Lo, my eye hath seen all \add this\add* , my ear hath heard and understood it. 
\v 2 What ye know, \add the same\add* do I know also: I \add am\add* not inferior to you. 
\v 3 Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God. 
\v 4 But ye \add are\add* forgers of lies, ye \add are\add* all physicians of no value. 
\v 5 O that ye would altogether hold your peace and it would be your wisdom. 
\v 6 Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips. 
\v 7 Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him? 
\v 8 Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God? 
\v 9 Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, do ye \add so\add* mock him? 
\v 10 He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons. 
\v 11 Shall not his excellence make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you? 
\v 12 Your remembrances \add are\add* like to ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay. 
\v 13 Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what \add will\add* . 
\v 14 Why do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in my hand? 
\v 15 Though he shall slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain my own ways before him. 
\v 16 He also \add shall be\add* my salvation: for a hypocrite shall not come before him. 
\v 17 Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears. 
\v 18 Behold now, I have ordered \add my\add* cause; I know that I shall be justified. 
\v 19 Who \add is\add* he \add that\add* will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall expire. 
\v 20 Only do not two \add things\add* to me: then will I not hide myself from thee. 
\v 21 Withdraw thy hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me afraid. 
\v 22 Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer thou me. 
\v 23 How many \add are\add* my iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression and my sin. 
\v 24 Why hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thy enemy? 
\v 25 Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble? 
\v 26 For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth. 
\v 27 Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly to all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet. 
\v 28 And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth-eaten. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1 Man \add that is\add* born of a woman \add is\add* of few days, and full of trouble. 
\v 2 He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not. 
\v 3 And dost thou open thy eyes upon such one, and bring me into judgment with thee? 
\v 4 Who can bring a clean \add thing\add* out of an unclean? not one. 
\v 5 Seeing his days \add are\add* determined, the number of his months \add is\add* with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass; 
\v 6 Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as a hireling, his day. 
\v 7 For there is hope of a tree, if it is cut down, that it will sprout again, and that its tender branch will not cease. 
\v 8 Though its root shall become old in the earth, and its stock die in the ground; 
\v 9  \add Yet\add* through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant. 
\v 10 But man dieth, and wasteth away: yes, man yieldeth his breath, and where \add is\add* he? 
\v 11  \add As\add* the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up: 
\v 12 So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens \add shall be\add* no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep. 
\v 13 O that thou wouldst hide me in the grave, that thou wouldst keep me secret, until thy wrath is past, that thou wouldst appoint me a set time, and remember me! 
\v 14 If a man dieth, shall he live \add again\add* ? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change shall come. 
\v 15 Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thy hands. 
\v 16 For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my sin? 
\v 17 My transgression \add is\add* sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up my iniquity. 
\v 18 And surely the mountain falling cometh to naught, and the rock is removed out of its place. 
\v 19 The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which grow \add out\add* of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man. 
\v 20 Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away. 
\v 21 His sons come to honor, and he knoweth \add it\add* not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth \add it\add* not of them. 
\v 22 But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1 Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said, 
\v 2 Should a wise men utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind? 
\v 3 Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches with which he can do no good? 
\v 4 Yes, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God. 
\v 5 For thy mouth uttereth thy iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty. 
\v 6 Thy own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yes, thy own lips testify against thee. 
\v 7  \add Art\add* thou the first man \add that\add* was born? or wast thou made before the hills? 
\v 8 Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself? 
\v 9 What knowest thou that we know not? \add what\add* understandest thou, which \add is\add* not in us? 
\v 10 With us \add are\add* both the gray headed and very aged men, much older than thy father. 
\v 11  \add Are\add* the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee? 
\v 12 Why doth thy heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at, 
\v 13 That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest \add such\add* words go out of thy mouth? 
\v 14 What \add is\add* man, that he should be clean? and \add he who is\add* born of a woman, that he should be righteous? 
\v 15 Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yes, the heavens are not clean in his sight. 
\v 16 How much more abominable and filthy \add is\add* man, who drinketh iniquity like water? 
\v 17 I will show thee, hear me; and that \add which\add* I have seen, I will declare; 
\v 18 Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid \add it\add* : 
\v 19 To whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them. 
\v 20 The wicked man travaileth with pain all \add his\add* days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor. 
\v 21 A dreadful sound \add is\add* in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him. 
\v 22 He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for by the sword. 
\v 23 He wandereth abroad for bread, \add saying\add* , Where \add is it\add* ? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand. 
\v 24 Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle. 
\v 25 For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty. 
\v 26 He runneth upon him, \add even\add* on \add his\add* neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers: 
\v 27 Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on \add his\add* flanks. 
\v 28 And he dwelleth in desolate cities, \add and\add* in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps. 
\v 29 He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection of it upon the earth. 
\v 30 He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away. 
\v 31 Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompense. 
\v 32 It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green. 
\v 33 He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive. 
\v 34 For the congregation of hypocrites \add shall be\add* desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery. 
\v 35 They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit. 
\c 16  
\p
\v 1 Then Job answered and said, 
\v 2 I have heard many such things: miserable comforters \add are\add* ye all. 
\v 3 Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest? 
\v 4 I also could speak as ye \add do\add* : if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake my head at you. 
\v 5  \add But\add* I would strengthen you with my mouth and the moving of my lips should assuage \add your grief\add* . 
\v 6 Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged: and \add though\add* I forbear, what am I eased? 
\v 7 But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company. 
\v 8 And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, \add which\add* is a witness \add against me\add* : and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face. 
\v 9 He teareth \add me\add* in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; my enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me. 
\v 10 They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves against me. 
\v 11 God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked. 
\v 12 I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken \add me\add* by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark. 
\v 13 His archers encompass me; he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground. 
\v 14 He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant. 
\v 15 I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust. 
\v 16 My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids \add are\add* the shades of death; 
\v 17 Not for \add any\add* injustice in my hands: also my prayer \add is\add* pure. 
\v 18 O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place. 
\v 19 Also now, behold, my witness \add is\add* in heaven, and my record \add is\add* on high. 
\v 20 My friends scorn me: \add but\add* my eye poureth out \add tears\add* to God. 
\v 21 O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man \add pleadeth\add* for his neighbor! 
\v 22 When a few years are come, then I shall go the way \add whence\add* I shall not return. 
\c 17  
\p
\v 1 My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves \add are ready\add* for me. 
\v 2  \add Are there\add* not mockers with me? and doth not my eye continue in their provocation? 
\v 3 Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who \add is\add* he \add that\add* will strike hands with me? 
\v 4 For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt \add them\add* . 
\v 5 He that speaketh flattery to \add his\add* friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail. 
\v 6 He hath made me also a by-word of the people; and in former time I was as a tabret. 
\v 7 My eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members \add are\add* as a shade. 
\v 8 Upright \add men\add* shall be astonished at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite. 
\v 9 The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger. 
\v 10 But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot find \add one\add* wise \add man\add* among you. 
\v 11 My days are past, my purposes are broken off, \add even\add* the thoughts of my heart. 
\v 12 They change the night into day: the light \add is\add* short because of darkness. 
\v 13 If I wait, the grave \add is\add* my house: I have made my bed in the darkness. 
\v 14 I have said to corruption, Thou \add art\add* my father: to the worm, \add Thou art\add* my mother, and my sister. 
\v 15 And where \add is\add* now my hope? as for my hope, who will see it? 
\v 16 They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when \add our\add* rest together \add is\add* in the dust. 
\c 18  
\p
\v 1 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 
\v 2 How long \add will it be ere\add* ye make an end of words? mark, and afterwards we will speak. 
\v 3 Why are we counted as beasts, \add and\add* reputed vile in your sight? 
\v 4 He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of its place? 
\v 5 Yes, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine. 
\v 6 The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put out with him. 
\v 7 The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down. 
\v 8 For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a snare. 
\v 9 The gin shall take \add him\add* by the heel, \add and\add* the robber shall prevail against him. 
\v 10 The snare \add is\add* laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way. 
\v 11 Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet. 
\v 12 His strength shall be hunger-bitten, and destruction \add shall be\add* ready at his side. 
\v 13 It shall devour the strength of his skin: \add even\add* the first-born of death shall devour his strength. 
\v 14 His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors. 
\v 15 It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because \add it is\add* none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation. 
\v 16 His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off. 
\v 17 His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street. 
\v 18 He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world. 
\v 19 He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings. 
\v 20 They that come after \add him\add* shall be astonished at his day, as they that went before were affrighted. 
\v 21 Surely such \add are\add* the dwellings of the wicked, and this \add is\add* the place \add of him that\add* knoweth not God. 
\c 19  
\p
\v 1 Then Job answered and said, 
\v 2 How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words? 
\v 3 These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed \add that\add* ye make yourselves strange to me. 
\v 4 And be it indeed \add that\add* I have erred, my error remaineth with myself. 
\v 5 If indeed ye will magnify \add yourselves\add* against me, and plead against me my reproach: 
\v 6 Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath encompassed me with his net. 
\v 7 Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but \add there is\add* no judgment. 
\v 8 He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths. 
\v 9 He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown \add from\add* my head. 
\v 10 He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and my hope hath he removed like a tree. 
\v 11 He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me to him as \add one of\add* his enemies. 
\v 12 His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp around my tabernacle. 
\v 13 He hath put my brethren far from me, and my acquaintance are verily estranged from me. 
\v 14 My kinsmen have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me. 
\v 15 They that dwell in my house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight. 
\v 16 I called my servant, and he gave \add me\add* no answer; I entreated him with my mouth. 
\v 17 My breath is strange to my wife, though I entreated for the children's \add sake\add* of my own body. 
\v 18 Yes, young children despised me; I arose, and they spoke against me. 
\v 19 All my intimate friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me. 
\v 20 My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I have escaped with the skin of my teeth. 
\v 21 Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me. 
\v 22 Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh? 
\v 23 Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book! 
\v 24 That they were graven with an iron pen in lead, in the rock for ever! 
\v 25 For I know \add that\add* my redeemer liveth, and \add that\add* he will stand at the latter \add day\add* upon the earth: 
\v 26 And \add though\add* after my skin \add worms\add* destroy this \add body\add* , yet in my flesh shall I see God: 
\v 27 Whom I shall see for myself, and my eyes shall behold, and not another; \add though\add* my reins be consumed within me. 
\v 28 But ye would say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me? 
\v 29 Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath \add bringeth\add* the punishments of the sword, that ye may know \add there\add* is a judgment. 
\c 20  
\p
\v 1 Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, 
\v 2 Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for \add this\add* I make haste. 
\v 3 I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer. 
\v 4 Knowest thou \add not\add* this of old, since man was placed upon earth, 
\v 5 That the triumphing of the wicked \add is\add* short, and the joy of the hypocrite \add but\add* for a moment? 
\v 6 Though his excellence shall mount up to the heavens, and his head reach to the clouds; 
\v 7  \add Yet\add* he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they who have seen him shall say, Where \add is\add* he? 
\v 8 He shall fly away as a dream, and will not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night. 
\v 9 The eye also \add which\add* saw him shall \add see him\add* no more; neither shall his place any more behold him. 
\v 10 His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods. 
\v 11 His bones are full \add of the sin\add* of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust. 
\v 12 Though wickedness may be sweet in his mouth, \add though\add* he may hide it under his tongue; 
\v 13  \add Though\add* he may spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth: 
\v 14  \add Yet\add* his food in his bowels is turned, \add it is\add* the gall of asps within him. 
\v 15 He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly. 
\v 16 He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall slay him. 
\v 17 He shall not see the river, the floods, the brooks of honey and buttermilk. 
\v 18 That which he labored for shall he restore, and shall not swallow \add it\add* : according to \add his\add* substance \add shall\add* the restitution \add be\add* , and he shall not rejoice \add in it\add* . 
\v 19 Because he hath oppressed \add and\add* hath forsaken the poor; \add because\add* he hath violently taken away a house which he did not build. 
\v 20 Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired. 
\v 21 There shall none of his food be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods. 
\v 22 In the fullness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him. 
\v 23  \add When\add* he is about to fill his belly, \add God\add* shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain \add it\add* upon him while he is eating. 
\v 24 He shall flee from the iron weapon, \add and\add* the bow of steel shall strike him through. 
\v 25 It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yes, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors \add are\add* upon him. 
\v 26 All darkness \add shall be\add* hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle. 
\v 27 The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him. 
\v 28 The increase of his house shall depart, \add and his goods\add* shall flow away in the day of his wrath. 
\v 29 This \add is\add* the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed to him by God. 
\c 21  
\p
\v 1 But Job answered and said, 
\v 2 Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations. 
\v 3 Suffer me that I may speak; and after I have spoken, mock on. 
\v 4 As for me, \add is\add* my complaint to man? and if \add it were so\add* , why should not my spirit be troubled? 
\v 5 Mark me, and be astonished, and lay \add your\add* hand upon \add your\add* mouth. 
\v 6 Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh. 
\v 7 Why do the wicked live, become old, and, are mighty in power? 
\v 8 Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes. 
\v 9 Their houses \add are\add* safe from fear, neither \add is\add* the rod of God upon them. 
\v 10 Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf. 
\v 11 They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance. 
\v 12 They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ. 
\v 13 They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave. 
\v 14 Therefore they say to God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways. 
\v 15 What \add is\add* the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray to him? 
\v 16 Lo, their good \add is\add* not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me. 
\v 17 How oft is the candle of the wicked put out? and \add how oft\add* cometh their destruction upon them? \add God\add* distributeth sorrows in his anger. 
\v 18 They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away. 
\v 19 God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know \add it\add* . 
\v 20 His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty. 
\v 21 For what pleasure \add hath\add* he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst? 
\v 22 Shall \add any\add* teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high. 
\v 23 One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet. 
\v 24 His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow. 
\v 25 And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure. 
\v 26 They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them. 
\v 27 Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices \add which\add* ye wrongfully imagine against me. 
\v 28 For ye say, Where \add is\add* the house of the prince? and where \add are\add* the dwelling places of the wicked? 
\v 29 Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens, 
\v 30 That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they will be brought forth to the day of wrath. 
\v 31 Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him \add what\add* he hath done? 
\v 32 Yet he shall be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb. 
\v 33 The clods of the valley will be sweet to him, and every man will draw after him, as \add there are\add* innumerable before him. 
\v 34 How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood? 
\c 22  
\p
\v 1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, 
\v 2 Can a man be profitable to God, as he that is wise may be profitable to himself? 
\v 3  \add Is it\add* any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or \add is it\add* gain \add to him\add* , that thou makest thy ways perfect? 
\v 4 Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment? 
\v 5  \add Is\add* not thy wickedness great? and thy iniquities infinite? 
\v 6 For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for naught, and stripped the naked of their clothing. 
\v 7 Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withheld bread from the hungry. 
\v 8 But \add as for\add* the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honorable man dwelt in it. 
\v 9 Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken. 
\v 10 Therefore snares \add are\add* around thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee; 
\v 11 Or darkness, \add that\add* thou canst not see; and abundance of waters cover thee. 
\v 12  \add Is\add* not God in the hight of heaven? and behold the hight of the stars, how high they are! 
\v 13 And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud? 
\v 14 Thick clouds \add are\add* a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven. 
\v 15 Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden? 
\v 16 Who were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflowed with a flood! 
\v 17 Who said to God, depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them! 
\v 18 Yet he filled their houses with good \add things\add* : but the counsel of the wicked is far from me. 
\v 19 The righteous see \add it\add* , and are glad: and the innocent deride them. 
\v 20 Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth. 
\v 21 Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: by this good shall come to thee. 
\v 22 Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thy heart. 
\v 23 If thou shalt return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles. 
\v 24 Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the \add gold\add* of Ophir as the stones of the brooks. 
\v 25 Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defense and thou shalt have plenty of silver. 
\v 26 For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face to God. 
\v 27 Thou shalt make thy prayer to him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows. 
\v 28 Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established to thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways. 
\v 29 When \add men\add* are cast down, then thou shalt say, \add There is\add* exaltation; and he shall save the humble person. 
\v 30 He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the pureness of thy hands. 
\c 23  
\p
\v 1 Then Job answered and said, 
\v 2 Even to-day \add is\add* my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning. 
\v 3 Oh that I knew where I might find him! \add that\add* I might come \add even\add* to his seat! 
\v 4 I would order \add my\add* cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments. 
\v 5 I would know the words \add which\add* he would answer me, and understand what he would say to me. 
\v 6 Would he plead against me with \add his\add* great power? No; but he would put \add strength\add* in me. 
\v 7 There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge. 
\v 8 Behold, I go forward, but he \add is\add* not \add there\add* ; and backward, but I cannot perceive him: 
\v 9 On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold \add him\add* : he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see \add him\add* : 
\v 10 But he knoweth the way that I take: \add when\add* he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold. 
\v 11 My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined. 
\v 12 Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary \add food\add* . 
\v 13 But he \add is\add* in one \add mind\add* , and who can turn him? and \add what\add* his soul desireth, even \add that\add* he doeth. 
\v 14 For he performeth \add the thing that is\add* appointed for me: and many such \add things are\add* with him. 
\v 15 Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him. 
\v 16 For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me: 
\v 17 Because I was not cut off before the darkness, \add neither\add* hath he covered the darkness from my face. 
\c 24  
\p
\v 1 Why, seeing times \add are\add* not hid from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days? 
\v 2  \add Some\add* remove the landmarks: they violently take away flocks, and \add their\add* feed. 
\v 3 They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow's ox for a pledge. 
\v 4 They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together. 
\v 5 Behold, \add as\add* wild asses in the desert, they go forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness \add yieldeth\add* food for them \add and\add* for \add their\add* children. 
\v 6 They reap \add every one\add* his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked. 
\v 7 They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that \add they have\add* no covering in the cold. 
\v 8 They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter. 
\v 9 They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor. 
\v 10 They cause \add him\add* to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf \add from\add* the hungry; 
\v 11  \add Who\add* make oil within their walls, \add and\add* tread \add their\add* wine-presses, and suffer thirst. 
\v 12 Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly \add to them\add* . 
\v 13 They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not its ways, nor abide in its paths. 
\v 14 The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief. 
\v 15 The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth \add his\add* face. 
\v 16 In the dark they dig through houses, \add which\add* they had marked for themselves in the day-time: they know not the light. 
\v 17 For the morning \add is\add* to them even as the shades of death: if \add one\add* knoweth \add them\add* , \add they are in\add* the terrors of the shades of death. 
\v 18 He \add is\add* swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards. 
\v 19 Drouth and heat consume the snow-waters: \add so doth\add* the grave \add those who\add* have sinned. 
\v 20 The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree. 
\v 21 He oppresseth the barren \add that\add* beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow. 
\v 22 He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no \add man\add* is sure of life. 
\v 23  \add Though\add* it is given him \add to be\add* in safety, on which he resteth; yet his eyes \add are\add* upon their ways. 
\v 24 They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all \add others\add* , and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn. 
\v 25 And if \add it is\add* not \add so\add* now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech of no worth? 
\c 25  
\p
\v 1 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 
\v 2 Dominion and fear \add are\add* with him, he maketh peace in his high places. 
\v 3 Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his light arise? 
\v 4 How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean \add that is\add* born of a woman? 
\v 5 Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; and the stars are not pure in his sight. 
\v 6 How much less man, \add that is\add* a worm; and the son of man, \add who is\add* a worm? 
\c 26  
\p
\v 1 But Job answered and said, 
\v 2 How hast thou helped \add him that is\add* without power? \add how\add* savest thou the arm \add that hath\add* no strength? 
\v 3 How hast thou counseled \add him that hath\add* no wisdom? and \add how\add* hast thou abundantly declared the thing as it is? 
\v 4 To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee? 
\v 5 Dead \add things\add* are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof. 
\v 6 Hell \add is\add* naked before him, and destruction hath no covering. 
\v 7 He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, \add and\add* hangeth the earth upon nothing. 
\v 8 He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them. 
\v 9 He holdeth back the face of \add his\add* throne, \add and\add* spreadeth his cloud upon it. 
\v 10 He hath encompassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end. 
\v 11 The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof. 
\v 12 He divideth the sea by his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud. 
\v 13 By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent. 
\v 14 Lo, these \add are\add* parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand? 
\c 27  
\p
\v 1 Moreover, Job continued his parable, and said, 
\v 2  \add As\add* God liveth, \add who\add* hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty \add who\add* hath afflicted my soul; 
\v 3 All the while my breath \add is\add* in me, and the spirit of God \add is\add* in my nostrils; 
\v 4 My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit. 
\v 5 Far be it from me that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove my integrity from me. 
\v 6 My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach \add me\add* so long as I live. 
\v 7 Let my enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous. 
\v 8 For what \add is\add* the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul? 
\v 9 Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him? 
\v 10 Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God? 
\v 11 I will teach you by the hand of God: \add that\add* which \add is\add* with the Almighty will I not conceal. 
\v 12 Behold, all ye yourselves have seen \add it\add* ; why then are ye thus altogether vain? 
\v 13 This \add is\add* the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, \add which\add* they shall receive of the Almighty. 
\v 14 If his children are multiplied, \add it is\add* for the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread. 
\v 15 Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows shall not weep. 
\v 16 Though he should heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay? 
\v 17 He may prepare \add it\add* , but the just shall put \add it\add* on, and the innocent shall divide the silver. 
\v 18 He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth \add that\add* the keeper maketh. 
\v 19 The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes, and he \add is\add* not. 
\v 20 Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the night. 
\v 21 The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his place. 
\v 22 For \add God\add* shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand. 
\v 23  \add Men\add* shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place. 
\c 28  
\p
\v 1 Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold \add where\add* they fine \add it\add* . 
\v 2 Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass \add is\add* melted \add out of\add* the stone. 
\v 3 He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shades of death. 
\v 4 The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant: \add even the waters\add* forgotten by the foot: they are dried up, they have gone away from men. 
\v 5  \add As for\add* the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire. 
\v 6 The stones of it \add are\add* the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of gold. 
\v 7  \add There is\add* a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vultur's eye hath not seen: 
\v 8 The lion's whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it. 
\v 9 He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots. 
\v 10 He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing. 
\v 11 He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and \add the thing that is\add* hid he bringeth forth to light. 
\v 12 But where shall wisdom be found? and where \add is\add* the place of understanding? 
\v 13 Man knoweth not the price of it; neither is it found in the land of the living. 
\v 14 The depth saith, It \add is\add* not in me: and the sea saith, \add It is\add* not with me. 
\v 15 It cannot be obtained for gold, neither shall silver be weighed \add for\add* the price of it. 
\v 16 It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire. 
\v 17 The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it \add shall not be for\add* jewels of fine gold. 
\v 18 No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom \add is\add* above rubies. 
\v 19 The topaz of Cush shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold. 
\v 20 Whence then cometh wisdom? and where \add is\add* the place of understanding? 
\v 21 Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air. 
\v 22 Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame of it with our ears. 
\v 23 God understandeth the way of it, and he knoweth its place. 
\v 24 For he looketh to the ends of the earth, \add and\add* seeth under the whole heaven; 
\v 25 To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure. 
\v 26 When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder: 
\v 27 Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out. 
\v 28 And to man he said, Behold, the fear of the LORD, that \add is\add* wisdom; and to depart from evil \add is\add* understanding. 
\c 29  
\p
\v 1 Moreover, Job continued his parable, and said, 
\v 2 Oh that I were as \add in\add* months past, as \add in\add* the days \add when\add* God preserved me; 
\v 3 When his candle shined upon my head, \add and when\add* by his light I walked \add through\add* darkness; 
\v 4 As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God \add was\add* upon my tabernacle; 
\v 5 When the Almighty \add was\add* yet with me, \add when\add* my children \add were\add* about me; 
\v 6 When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil; 
\v 7 When I went out to the gate through the city, \add when\add* I prepared my seat in the street! 
\v 8 The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, \add and\add* stood up. 
\v 9 The princes refrained talking, and laid \add their\add* hand on their mouth. 
\v 10 The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth. 
\v 11 When the ear heard \add me\add* , then it blessed me; and when the eye saw \add me\add* , it gave witness to me: 
\v 12 Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and \add him that had\add* none to help him. 
\v 13 The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy. 
\v 14 I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment \add was\add* as a robe and a diadem. 
\v 15 I was eyes to the blind, and feet \add was\add* I to the lame. 
\v 16 I \add was\add* a father to the poor: and the cause \add which\add* I knew not I searched out. 
\v 17 And I broke the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth. 
\v 18 Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply \add my\add* days as the sand. 
\v 19 My root \add was\add* spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch. 
\v 20 My glory \add was\add* fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand. 
\v 21 To me \add men\add* gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel. 
\v 22 After my words they spoke not again; and my speech dropped upon them. 
\v 23 And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide \add as\add* for the latter rain. 
\v 24  \add If\add* I laughed on them, they believed \add it\add* not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down. 
\v 25 I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one \add that\add* comforteth the mourners. 
\c 30  
\p
\v 1 But now \add they that are\add* younger than I, have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to set with the dogs of my flock. 
\v 2 Yes, to what \add might\add* the strength of their hands \add profit\add* me, in whom old age had perished? 
\v 3 For want and famine \add they were\add* solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste. 
\v 4 Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots \add for\add* their food. 
\v 5 They were driven forth from among \add men\add* , (they cried after them, as \add after\add* a thief;) 
\v 6 To dwell in the clefts of the valleys, \add in\add* caves of the earth, and \add in\add* the rocks. 
\v 7 Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were collected. 
\v 8  \add They were\add* children of fools, yes, children of base men: they were viler than the earth. 
\v 9 And now I am their song, yes, I am their by-word. 
\v 10 They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face. 
\v 11 Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me. 
\v 12 Upon \add my\add* right \add hand\add* rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction. 
\v 13 They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper. 
\v 14 They came \add upon me\add* as a wide breaking in \add of waters\add* : in the desolation they rolled themselves \add upon me\add* . 
\v 15 Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud. 
\v 16 And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me. 
\v 17 My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest. 
\v 18 By the great force \add of my disease\add* is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat. 
\v 19 He hath cast me into the mire, and I have become like dust and ashes. 
\v 20 I cry to thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me \add not\add* . 
\v 21 Thou hast become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me. 
\v 22 Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride \add upon it\add* , and dissolvest my substance. 
\v 23 For I know \add that\add* thou wilt bring me \add to\add* death, and \add to\add* the house appointed for all living. 
\v 24 Yet he will not stretch out \add his\add* hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction. 
\v 25 Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was \add not\add* my soul grieved for the poor? 
\v 26 When I looked for good, then evil came: and when I waited for light, there came darkness. 
\v 27 My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction came upon me. 
\v 28 I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, \add and\add* I cried in the congregation. 
\v 29 I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls. 
\v 30 My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat. 
\v 31 My harp also is \add turned\add* to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep. 
\c 31  
\p
\v 1 I Made a covenant with my eyes; why then should I think upon a maid? 
\v 2 For what portion of God \add is there\add* from above? and \add what\add* inheritance of the Almighty from on high? 
\v 3  \add Is\add* not destruction to the wicked? and a strange \add punishment\add* to the workers of iniquity? 
\v 4 Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps? 
\v 5 If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit; 
\v 6 Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know my integrity. 
\v 7 If my step hath turned out of the way, and my heart walked after my eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to my hands; 
\v 8  \add Then\add* let me sow, and let another eat; yes, let my offspring be rooted out. 
\v 9 If my heart hath been deceived by a woman, or \add if\add* I have laid wait at my neighbor's door; 
\v 10  \add Then\add* let my wife grind to another, and let others bow down upon her. 
\v 11 For this \add is\add* a hainous crime; yea, it \add is\add* an iniquity \add to be punished by\add* the judges. 
\v 12 For it \add is\add* a fire \add that\add* consumeth to destruction, and would root out all my increase. 
\v 13 If I despised the cause of my man-servant or of my maid-servant, when they contended with me; 
\v 14 What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him? 
\v 15 Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb? 
\v 16 If I have withheld the poor from \add their\add* desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail; 
\v 17 Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten of it; 
\v 18 (For from my youth he was brought up with me, as \add with\add* a father, and I have guided her from my mother's womb;) 
\v 19 If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering; 
\v 20 If his loins have not blessed me, and \add if\add* he hath not been warmed with the fleece of my sheep; 
\v 21 If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate: 
\v 22  \add Then\add* let my arm fall from my shoulder-blade, and my arm be broken from the bone. 
\v 23 For destruction \add from\add* God \add was\add* a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure. 
\v 24 If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, \add Thou art\add* my confidence; 
\v 25 If I have rejoiced because my wealth \add was\add* great, and because my hand had gained much; 
\v 26 If I have beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking \add in\add* brightness; 
\v 27 And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand: 
\v 28 This also \add were\add* an iniquity \add to be punished by\add* the judge: for I should have denied the God \add that is\add* above. 
\v 29 If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or have lifted up myself when evil found him: 
\v 30 Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul. 
\v 31 If the men of my tabernacle have not said, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied. 
\v 32 The stranger did not lodge in the street: \add but\add* I opened my doors to the traveler. 
\v 33 If I have covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding my iniquity in my bosom: 
\v 34 Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, \add and\add* went not out of the door? 
\v 35 Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire \add is\add* , \add that\add* the Almighty would answer me, and \add that\add* my adversary had written a book. 
\v 36 Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, \add and\add* bind it \add as\add* a crown to me. 
\v 37 I would declare to him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near to him. 
\v 38 If my land crieth against me, or its furrows likewise complain; 
\v 39 If I have eaten the fruits of it without money, or have caused its owners to lose their life: 
\v 40 Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended. 
\c 32  
\p
\v 1 So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he \add was\add* righteous in his own eyes. 
\v 2 Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God. 
\v 3 Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and \add yet\add* had condemned Job. 
\v 4 Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken because they \add were\add* older than he. 
\v 5 When Elihu saw that \add there was\add* no answer in the mouth of \add these\add* three men, then his wrath was kindled. 
\v 6 And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I \add am\add* young, and ye \add are\add* very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not show you my opinion. 
\v 7 I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom. 
\v 8 But \add there is\add* a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding. 
\v 9 Great men are not \add always\add* wise: neither do the aged understand judgment. 
\v 10 Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will show my opinion. 
\v 11 Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say. 
\v 12 Yes, I attended to you, and behold, \add there was\add* none of you that convinced Job, \add or\add* that answered his words: 
\v 13 Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man. 
\v 14 Now he hath not directed \add his\add* words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches. 
\v 15 They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking. 
\v 16 When I had waited, (for they spoke not, but stood still, \add and\add* answered no more;) 
\v 17  \add I said\add* , I will answer also my part, I also will show my opinion. 
\v 18 For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me. 
\v 19 Behold, my belly \add is\add* as wine \add which\add* hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles. 
\v 20 I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer. 
\v 21 Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles to man. 
\v 22 For I know not to give flattering titles; \add in so doing\add* , my Maker would soon take me away. 
\c 33  
\p
\v 1 Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words. 
\v 2 Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth. 
\v 3 My words \add shall be of\add* the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly. 
\v 4 The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life. 
\v 5 If thou canst answer me, set \add thy words\add* in order before me, stand up. 
\v 6 Behold, I \add am\add* according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of the clay. 
\v 7 Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee. 
\v 8 Surely thou hast spoken in my hearing, and I have heard the voice of \add thy\add* words, \add saying\add* , 
\v 9 I am clean without transgression, I \add am\add* innocent; neither \add is there\add* iniquity in me. 
\v 10 Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy, 
\v 11 He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths. 
\v 12 Behold, \add in\add* this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man. 
\v 13 Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters. 
\v 14 For God speaketh once, yes twice, \add yet man\add* perceiveth it not. 
\v 15 In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed; 
\v 16 Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction, 
\v 17 That he may withdraw man \add from his\add* purpose, and hide pride from man. 
\v 18 He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword. 
\v 19 He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong \add pain\add* : 
\v 20 So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty food. 
\v 21 His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones \add that\add* were not seen stick out. 
\v 22 Yes, his soul draweth near to the grave, and his life to the destroyers. 
\v 23 If there is a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to show to man his uprightness: 
\v 24 Then he is gracious to him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom. 
\v 25 His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he will return to the days of his youth: 
\v 26 He shall pray to God, and he will be favorable to him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render to man his righteousness. 
\v 27 He looketh upon men, and \add if any\add* shall say, I have sinned, and perverted \add that which was\add* right, and it profited me not; 
\v 28 He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light. 
\v 29 Lo, all these \add things\add* God often worketh with man, 
\v 30 To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living. 
\v 31 Mark well, O Job, hearken to me: hold thy peace, and I will speak. 
\v 32 If thou hast any thing to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee. 
\v 33 If not, hearken to me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom. 
\c 34  
\p
\v 1 Furthermore Elihu answered and said, 
\v 2 Hear my words, O ye wise \add men\add* ; and give ear to me, ye that have knowledge. 
\v 3 For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth food. 
\v 4 Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what \add is\add* good. 
\v 5 For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment. 
\v 6 Should I lie against my right? my wound \add is\add* incurable without transgression. 
\v 7 What man \add is\add* like Job, \add who\add* drinketh up scorning like water? 
\v 8 Who goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men. 
\v 9 For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God. 
\v 10 Therefore hearken to me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, \add that he should do\add* wickedness; and \add from\add* the Almighty, \add that he should commit\add* iniquity. 
\v 11 For the work of a man he shall render to him, and cause every man to find according to \add his\add* ways. 
\v 12 Yes, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment. 
\v 13 Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world? 
\v 14 If he should set his heart upon man, \add if\add* he should gather to himself his spirit and his breath; 
\v 15 All flesh would perish together, and man would turn again to dust. 
\v 16 If now \add thou hast\add* understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words. 
\v 17 Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just? 
\v 18  \add Is it fit\add* to say to a king, \add Thou art\add* wicked? \add and\add* to princes, \add Ye are\add* ungodly? 
\v 19  \add How much less to him\add* that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all \add are\add* the work of his hands. 
\v 20 In a moment they shall die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand. 
\v 21 For his eyes \add are\add* upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings. 
\v 22  \add There is\add* no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves. 
\v 23 For he will not lay upon man more \add than right\add* ; that he should enter into judgment with God. 
\v 24 He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead. 
\v 25 Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth \add them\add* in the night, so that they are destroyed. 
\v 26 He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others; 
\v 27 Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways: 
\v 28 So that they cause the cry of the poor to come to him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted. 
\v 29 When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth \add his\add* face, who then can behold him? whether \add it be done\add* against a nation, or against a man only: 
\v 30 That the hypocrite may not reign, lest the people should be ensnared. 
\v 31 Surely it is meet to be said to God, I have borne \add chastisement\add* , I will not offend \add any more\add* : 
\v 32  \add That which\add* I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more. 
\v 33  \add Should it be\add* according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou shalt refuse, or whether thou shalt choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest. 
\v 34 Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken to me. 
\v 35 Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words \add were\add* without wisdom. 
\v 36 My desire \add is that\add* Job may be tried to the end, because of \add his\add* answers for wicked men. 
\v 37 For he addeth rebellion to his sin, he clappeth \add his hands\add* among us, and multiplieth his words against God. 
\c 35  
\p
\v 1 Elihu spoke moreover, and said, 
\v 2 Thinkest thou this to be right, \add that\add* thou saidst, My righteousness \add is\add* more than God's? 
\v 3 For thou saidst, What advantage will it be to thee? \add and\add* , What profit shall I have, \add if I be cleansed\add* from my sin? 
\v 4 I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee. 
\v 5 Look to the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds \add which\add* are higher than thou. 
\v 6 If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or \add if\add* thy transgressions are multiplied, what doest thou to him? 
\v 7 If thou art righteous, what givest thou to him? or what receiveth he from thy hand? 
\v 8 Thy wickedness \add may hurt\add* a man as thou \add art\add* : and thy righteousness \add may profit\add* the son of man. 
\v 9 By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make \add the oppressed\add* to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty. 
\v 10 But none saith, Where \add is\add* God my maker, who giveth songs in the night; 
\v 11 Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven? 
\v 12 There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men. 
\v 13 Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it. 
\v 14 Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, \add yet\add* judgment \add is\add* before him; therefore trust thou in him. 
\v 15 But now, because \add it is\add* not \add so\add* , he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth \add it\add* not in great extremity: 
\v 16 Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge. 
\c 36  
\p
\v 1 Elihu also proceeded, and said, 
\v 2 Suffer me a little, and I will show thee that \add I have\add* yet to speak on God's behalf. 
\v 3 I will bring my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker. 
\v 4 For truly my words \add shall\add* not \add be\add* false: he that is perfect in knowledge \add is\add* with thee. 
\v 5 Behold, God \add is\add* mighty, and despiseth not \add any\add* : \add he is\add* mighty in strength \add and\add* wisdom. 
\v 6 He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor. 
\v 7 He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings \add are they\add* on the throne; yes, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted. 
\v 8 And if \add they are\add* bound in fetters, \add and\add* are held in cords of affliction; 
\v 9 Then he showeth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded. 
\v 10 He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity. 
\v 11 If they obey and serve \add him\add* , they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures. 
\v 12 But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge. 
\v 13 But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them. 
\v 14 They die in youth, and their life \add is\add* among the unclean. 
\v 15 He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression. 
\v 16 Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait \add into\add* a broad place, where \add there is\add* no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table \add would be\add* full of fatness. 
\v 17 But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold \add on thee\add* . 
\v 18 Because \add there is\add* wrath, \add beware\add* lest he take thee away with \add his\add* stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee. 
\v 19 Will he esteem thy riches? \add no\add* , not gold, nor all the forces of strength. 
\v 20 Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place. 
\v 21 Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction. 
\v 22 Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him? 
\v 23 Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity? 
\v 24 Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold. 
\v 25 Every man may see it; man may behold \add it\add* afar off. 
\v 26 Behold, God \add is\add* great, and we know \add him\add* not, neither can the number of his years be searched out. 
\v 27 For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapor of it. 
\v 28 Which the clouds do drop \add and\add* distill upon man abundantly. 
\v 29 Also can \add any\add* understand the spreadings of the clouds, \add or\add* the noise of his tabernacle? 
\v 30 Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea. 
\v 31 For by them he judgeth the people; he giveth food in abundance. 
\v 32 With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it \add not to shine\add* by \add the\add* intervening \add cloud\add* . 
\v 33 The noise of it showeth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapor. 
\c 37  
\p
\v 1 At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of its place. 
\v 2 Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound \add that\add* goeth out of his mouth. 
\v 3 He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning to the ends of the earth. 
\v 4 After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellence; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard. 
\v 5 God thundereth marvelously with his voice; great things he doeth, which we cannot comprehend. 
\v 6 For he saith to the snow, Be thou \add on\add* the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength. 
\v 7 He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work. 
\v 8 Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places. 
\v 9 From the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold from the north. 
\v 10 By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened. 
\v 11 Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud: 
\v 12 And it is turned around by his counsels: that they may do whatever he commandeth them upon the face of the world on the earth. 
\v 13 He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy. 
\v 14 Hearken to this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God. 
\v 15 Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine? 
\v 16 Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge? 
\v 17 How thy garments \add are\add* warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south \add wind\add* ? 
\v 18 Hast thou with him spread out the sky \add which is\add* strong, \add and\add* as a molten looking-glass? 
\v 19 Teach us what we shall say to him; \add for\add* we cannot order \add our speech\add* by reason of darkness. 
\v 20 Shall it be told him that I speak? If a man shall speak, surely he will be swallowed up. 
\v 21 And now \add men\add* see not the bright light which \add is\add* in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them. 
\v 22 Fair weather cometh from the north: with God \add is\add* terrible majesty. 
\v 23  \add Touching\add* the Almighty, we cannot find him out: \add he is\add* excellent in power, and in judgment, and in abundance of justice: he will not afflict. 
\v 24 Men therefore fear him: he respecteth not any \add that are\add* wise of heart. 
\c 38  
\p
\v 1 Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said, 
\v 2 Who \add is\add* this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge? 
\v 3 Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me. 
\v 4 Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding. 
\v 5 Who hath laid the measures of it, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it? 
\v 6 Upon what are the foundations of it fastened? or who laid its corner stone; 
\v 7 When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy? 
\v 8 Or \add who\add* shut up the sea with doors, when it broke forth, \add as if\add* it had issued out of the womb? 
\v 9 When I made a cloud its garment, and thick darkness a swaddling band for it, 
\v 10 And broke up for it my decreed \add place\add* , and set bars and doors, 
\v 11 And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed. 
\v 12 Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; \add and\add* caused the day-spring to know its place; 
\v 13 That it might take hold of the ends of earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it? 
\v 14 It is turned as clay \add to\add* the seal; and they stand as a garment. 
\v 15 And from the wicked their light is withheld, and the high arm shall be broken. 
\v 16 Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth? 
\v 17 Have the gates of death been opened to thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shades of death? 
\v 18 Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou knowest it all. 
\v 19 Where \add is\add* the way \add where\add* light dwelleth? and \add as for\add* darkness, where \add is\add* its place, 
\v 20 That thou shouldest take it to its bound, and that thou shouldest know the paths \add to\add* its house? 
\v 21 Knowest thou \add it\add* , because thou wast then born? or \add because\add* the number of thy days \add is\add* great? 
\v 22 Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail, 
\v 23 Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war? 
\v 24 By what way is the light parted, \add which\add* scattereth the east wind upon the earth? 
\v 25 Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder; 
\v 26 To cause it to rain on the earth, \add where\add* no man \add is\add* ; \add on\add* the wilderness in which \add there is\add* no man; 
\v 27 To satisfy the desolate and waste \add ground\add* ; and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth? 
\v 28 Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of the dew? 
\v 29 Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it? 
\v 30 The waters are hid as \add with\add* a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen. 
\v 31 Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion? 
\v 32 Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in its season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with its sons? 
\v 33 Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set its dominion on the earth? 
\v 34 Canst thou lift thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee? 
\v 35 Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say to thee, Here we \add are\add* ? 
\v 36 Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the heart? 
\v 37 Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of heaven, 
\v 38 When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast together? 
\v 39 Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of the young lions, 
\v 40 When they couch in \add their\add* dens, \add and\add* abide in the covert to lie in wait? 
\v 41 Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry to God, they wander for want of food. 
\c 39  
\p
\v 1 Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? \add or\add* canst thou mark when the hinds do calve? 
\v 2 Canst thou number the months \add that\add* they fulfill? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth? 
\v 3 They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they cast out their sorrows. 
\v 4 Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they go forth, and return not to them. 
\v 5 Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass? 
\v 6 Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his dwellings. 
\v 7 He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the crying of the driver. 
\v 8 The range of the mountains \add is\add* his pasture, and he searcheth after every green thing. 
\v 9 Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib? 
\v 10 Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee? 
\v 11 Wilt thou trust him, because his strength \add is\add* great? or wilt thou leave thy labor to him? 
\v 12 Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather \add it into\add* thy barn? 
\v 13  \add Gavest thou\add* the goodly wings to the peacocks? or wings and feathers to the ostrich! 
\v 14 Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in the dust, 
\v 15 And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them. 
\v 16 She is hardened against her young ones, as though \add they were\add* not hers: her labor is in vain without fear; 
\v 17 Because God hath withheld wisdom from her, neither hath he imparted to her understanding. 
\v 18 When she lifteth herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider. 
\v 19 Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder? 
\v 20 Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils \add is\add* terrible. 
\v 21 He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in \add his\add* strength: he goeth on to meet the armed men. 
\v 22 He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword. 
\v 23 The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield. 
\v 24 He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believeth he that \add it is\add* the sound of the trumpet. 
\v 25 He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting. 
\v 26 Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, \add and\add* stretch her wings towards the south? 
\v 27 Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high? 
\v 28 She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place. 
\v 29 From thence she seeketh the prey, \add and\add* her eyes behold afar off. 
\v 30 Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain \add are\add* , there \add is\add* she. 
\c 40  
\p
\v 1 Moreover, the LORD answered Job, and said, 
\v 2 Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct \add him\add* ? he that reproveth God, let him answer it. 
\v 3 Then Job answered the LORD, and said, 
\v 4 Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay my hand upon my mouth. 
\v 5 Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yes, twice; but I will proceed no further. 
\v 6 Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said, 
\v 7 Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou to me. 
\v 8 Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous? 
\v 9 Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like his? 
\v 10 Deck thyself now \add with\add* majesty and excellence; and array thyself with glory and beauty. 
\v 11 Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one \add that is\add* proud, and abase him. 
\v 12 Look on every one \add that is\add* proud, \add and\add* bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place. 
\v 13 Hide them in the dust together; bind their faces in secret. 
\v 14 Then will I also confess to thee that thy own right hand can save thee. 
\v 15 Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox. 
\v 16 Lo now, his strength \add is\add* in his loins, and his force \add is\add* in the navel of his belly. 
\v 17 He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his male organs are wrapped together. 
\v 18 His bones \add are as\add* strong pieces of brass; his bones \add are\add* like bars of iron. 
\v 19 He \add is\add* the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach \add him\add* . 
\v 20 Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play. 
\v 21 He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens. 
\v 22 The shady trees cover him \add with\add* their shadow; the willows of the brook encompass him. 
\v 23 Behold, he drinketh up a river, \add and\add* hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth. 
\v 24 He taketh it with his eyes: \add his\add* nose pierceth through snares.

\v 1 Canst thou draw out leviathan with a hook? or his tongue with a cord \add which\add* thou lettest down? 
\v 2 Canst thou put a hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn? 
\v 3 Will he make many supplications to thee? will he speak soft \add words\add* to thee? 
\v 4 Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever? 
\v 5 Wilt thou play with him as \add with\add* a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens? 
\v 6 Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants. 
\v 7 Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears? 
\v 8 Lay thy hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more. 
\v 9 Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not \add one\add* be cast down even at the sight of him? 
\v 10 None \add is so\add* fierce that he dare rouse him: who then is able to stand before me? 
\v 11 Who hath first benefited me, that I should repay \add him\add* ? \add whatever is\add* under the whole heaven is mine. 
\v 12 I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion. 
\v 13 Who can discover the face of his garment? \add or\add* who can come \add to him\add* with his double bridle? 
\v 14 Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth \add are\add* terrible around. 
\v 15  \add His\add* scales \add are his\add* pride, shut together \add as with\add* a close seal. 
\v 16 One is so near to another, that no air can come between them. 
\v 17 They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered. 
\v 18 His sneezings flash light, and his eyes \add are\add* like the eyelids of the morning. 
\v 19 Out of his mouth go burning lamps, \add and\add* sparks of fire dart forth. 
\v 20 Out of his nostrils issueth smoke, as \add out\add* of a seething pot or caldron. 
\v 21 His breath kindleth coals, and a flame issueth from his mouth. 
\v 22 In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him. 
\v 23 The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved. 
\v 24 His heart is as firm as a stone; yes, as hard as a piece of the nether \add millstone\add* . 
\v 25 When he raiseth himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves. 
\v 26 The sword of him that attacketh him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon. 
\v 27 He esteemeth iron as straw, \add and\add* brass as rotten wood. 
\v 28 The arrow cannot make him flee: sling-stones are turned with him into stubble. 
\v 29 Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear. 
\v 30 Sharp stones \add are\add* under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire. 
\v 31 He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment. 
\v 32 He maketh a path to shine after him; \add one\add* would think the deep \add to be\add* hoary. 
\v 33 Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear. 
\v 34 He beholdeth all high \add things\add* : he \add is\add* a king over all the children of pride.

\v 1 Then Job answered the LORD, and said, 
\v 2 I know that thou canst do every \add thing\add* , and \add that\add* no thought can be withheld from thee. 
\v 3 Who \add is\add* he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that which I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not. 
\v 4 Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will ask of thee, and declare thou to me. 
\v 5 I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now my eye seeth thee. 
\v 6 Wherefore I abhor \add myself\add* , and repent in dust and ashes. 
\v 7 And it was \add so\add* , that after the LORD had spoken these words to Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me \add the thing that is\add* right, as my servant Job \add hath\add* . 
\v 8 Therefore take to you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer for yourselves a burnt-offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you \add after your\add* folly, in that ye have not spoken of me \add the thing which is\add* right, like my servant Job. 
\v 9 So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite \add and\add* Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them: the LORD also accepted Job. 
\v 10 And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before. 
\v 11 Then came there to him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and ate bread with him in his house: and they condoled with him, and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an ear-ring of gold. 
\v 12 So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses. 
\v 13 He had also seven sons, and three daughters. 
\v 14 And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Keren-happuch. 
\v 15 And in all the land were no women found \add so\add* fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren. 
\v 16 After this Job lived a hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, \add even\add* four generations. 
\v 17 So Job died, \add being\add* old and full of days.
