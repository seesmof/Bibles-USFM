\v 1 Blessed \add is\add* the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of scoffers. 
\v 2 But his delight \add is\add* in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night. 
\v 3 And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth its fruit in season; its leaf also shall not wither; and whatever he doeth shall prosper. 
\v 4 The ungodly \add are\add* not so: but \add are\add* like the chaff which the wind driveth away. 
\v 5 Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. 
\v 6 For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.

\v 1 Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? 
\v 2 The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, \add saying\add* , 
\v 3 Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us. 
\v 4 He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the LORD shall have them in derision. 
\v 5 Then shall he speak to them in his wrath, and trouble them in his sore displeasure. 
\v 6 Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion. 
\v 7 I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said to me, Thou \add art\add* my Son; this day have I begotten thee. 
\v 8 Ask of me, and I will give \add thee\add* the heathen \add for\add* thy inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth \add for\add* thy possession. 
\v 9 Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel. 
\v 10 Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth. 
\v 11 Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling. 
\v 12 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish \add from\add* the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed \add are\add* all they that put their trust in him.

\v 1 A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son. LORD, how are they multiplied that trouble me? many \add are\add* they that rise up against me. 
\v 2 Many \add there are\add* who say of my soul, \add There is\add* no help for him in God. Selah. 
\v 3 But thou, O LORD, \add art\add* a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of my head. 
\v 4 I cried to the LORD with my voice, and he heard me from his holy hill. Selah. 
\v 5 I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me. 
\v 6 I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set \add themselves\add* against me on all sides. 
\v 7 Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all my enemies \add upon\add* the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly. 
\v 8 Salvation \add belongeth\add* to the LORD: thy blessing \add is\add* upon thy people. Selah.

\v 1 To the chief Musician on Neginoth, A Psalm of David. Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me \add when I was\add* in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer. 
\v 2 O ye sons of men, how long \add will ye turn\add* my glory into shame? \add how long\add* will ye love vanity, \add and\add* seek after falsehood? Selah. 
\v 3 But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the LORD will hear when I call to him. 
\v 4 Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah. 
\v 5 Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD. 
\v 6  \add There are\add* many that say, Who will show us \add any\add* good? LORD, lift thou upon us the light of thy countenance. 
\v 7 Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time \add when\add* their corn and their wine increased. 
\v 8 I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep; for thou only, LORD, makest me dwell in safety. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 To the chief Musician upon Nehiloth, A Psalm of David. Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation. 
\v 2 Hearken to the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for to thee will I pray. 
\v 3 My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct \add my prayer\add* to thee, and will look up. 
\v 4 For thou \add art\add* not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee. 
\v 5 The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity. 
\v 6 Thou shalt destroy them that speak falsehood: the LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man. 
\v 7 But as for me, I will come \add into\add* thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: \add and\add* in thy fear will I worship towards thy holy temple. 
\v 8 Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness, because of my enemies; make thy way straight before my face. 
\v 9 For \add there is\add* no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part \add is\add* very wickedness; their throat \add is\add* an open sepulcher; they flatter with their tongue. 
\v 10 Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee. 
\v 11 But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee. 
\v 12 For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favor wilt thou compass him as \add with\add* a shield.

\p
\v 1 To the chief Musician on Neginoth upon Sheminith, A Psalm of David. O LORD, rebuke me not in thy anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. 
\v 2 Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I \add am\add* weak: O LORD, heal me; for my bones are agitated. 
\v 3 My soul is also greatly disquieted: but thou, O LORD, how long? 
\v 4 Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: Oh save me for thy mercies sake. 
\v 5 For in death \add there is\add* no remembrance of thee: in the grave who will give thee thanks? 
\v 6 I am weary with my groaning; all the night I make my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears. 
\v 7 My eye is consumed because of grief; it groweth old because of all my enemies. 
\v 8 Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping. 
\v 9 The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my prayer. 
\v 10 Let all my enemies be ashamed and greatly disquieted: let them return \add and\add* be suddenly ashamed.

\v 1 Shiggaion of David, which he sang to the LORD, concerning the words of Cush the Benjaminite. O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me: 
\v 2 Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending \add it\add* in pieces, while \add there is\add* none to deliver. 
\v 3 O LORD my God, if I have done this; if there is iniquity in my hands; 
\v 4 If I have rewarded evil to him that was at peace with me; (yes, I have delivered him that without cause is my enemy:) 
\v 5 Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take \add it\add* ; yes, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay my honor in the dust. Selah. 
\v 6 Arise, O LORD, in thy anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of my enemies: and awake for me \add to\add* the judgment \add that\add* thou hast commanded. 
\v 7 So shall the congregation of the people encompass thee: for their sakes therefore return thou on high. 
\v 8 The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to my integrity \add that is\add* in me. 
\v 9 Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins. 
\v 10 My defense \add is\add* from God, who saveth the upright in heart. 
\v 11 God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry \add with the wicked\add* every day. 
\v 12 If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready. 
\v 13 He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors. 
\v 14 Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood. 
\v 15 He made a pit, and digged it, and hath fallen into the ditch \add which\add* he made. 
\v 16 His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate. 
\v 17 I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.

\v 1 To the chief Musician upon Gittith, A Psalm of David. O LORD our Lord, how excellent \add is\add* thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens. 
\v 2 Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thy enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger. 
\v 3 When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers; the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; 
\v 4 What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him? 
\v 5 For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honor. 
\v 6 Thou hast made him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all \add things\add* under his feet: 
\v 7 All sheep and oxen, yes, and the beasts of the field; 
\v 8 The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, \add and whatever\add* passeth through the paths of the seas. 
\v 9 O LORD our Lord, how excellent \add is\add* thy name in all the earth! 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 To the chief Musician upon Muthlabben, A Psalm of David. I will praise \add thee\add* , O LORD, with my whole heart; I will show forth all thy wonderful works. 
\v 2 I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High. 
\v 3 When my enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence. 
\v 4 For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou sattest on the throne judging right. 
\v 5 Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever. 
\v 6 O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial hath perished with them. 
\v 7 But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment. 
\v 8 And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness. 
\v 9 The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble. 
\v 10 And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee. 
\v 11 Sing praises to the LORD, who dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings. 
\v 12 When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the humble. 
\v 13 Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble \add which I suffer\add* from them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death: 
\v 14 That I may show forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation. 
\v 15 The heathen are sunk down in the pit \add that\add* they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken. 
\v 16 The LORD is known \add by\add* the judgment \add which\add* he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah. 
\v 17 The wicked shall be turned into hell, \add and\add* all the nations that forget God. 
\v 18 For the needy shall not always be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall \add not\add* perish for ever. 
\v 19 Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in thy sight. 
\v 20 Put them in fear, O LORD: \add that\add* the nations may know themselves \add to be but\add* men. Selah. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1 Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? \add why\add* hidest thou \add thyself\add* in times of trouble? 
\v 2 The wicked in \add his\add* pride doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined. 
\v 3 For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, \add whom\add* the LORD abhorreth. 
\v 4 The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek \add after God\add* : God \add is\add* not in all his thoughts. 
\v 5 His ways are always grievous; thy judgments \add are\add* far above out of his sight: \add as for\add* all his enemies, he puffeth at them. 
\v 6 He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for \add I shall\add* never \add be\add* in adversity. 
\v 7 His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue \add is\add* mischief and vanity. 
\v 8 He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the poor. 
\v 9 He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net. 
\v 10 He croucheth, \add and\add* humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by his strong ones. 
\v 11 He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see \add it\add* . 
\v 12 Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thy hand: forget not the humble. 
\v 13 Why doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require \add it\add* . 
\v 14 Thou hast seen \add it\add* ; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite \add it\add* with thy hand: the poor committeth himself to thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless. 
\v 15 Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil \add man\add* : seek out his wickedness \add till\add* thou shalt find none. 
\v 16 The LORD \add is\add* King for ever and ever: the heathen have perished out of his land. 
\v 17 LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thy ear to hear: 
\v 18 To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress.

\v 1 To the chief Musician, \add A Psalm\add* of David. In the LORD I put my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee \add as\add* a bird to your mountain? 
\v 2 For lo, the wicked bend \add their\add* bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart. 
\v 3 If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do? 
\v 4 The LORD \add is\add* in his holy temple, the LORD'S throne \add is\add* in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try the children of men. 
\v 5 The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth. 
\v 6 Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and a horrible tempest: \add this shall be\add* the portion of their cup. 
\v 7 For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance beholdeth the upright. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 To the chief Musician upon Sheminith. A Psalm of David. Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men. 
\v 2 They speak vanity every one with his neighbor: \add with\add* flattering lips \add and\add* with a double heart do they speak. 
\v 3 The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, \add and\add* the tongue that speaketh proud things: 
\v 4 Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips \add are\add* our own: who \add is\add* lord over us? 
\v 5 For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the LORD; I will set \add him\add* in safety \add from him that\add* puffeth at him. 
\v 6 The words of the LORD \add are\add* pure words: \add as\add* silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. 
\v 7 Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever. 
\v 8 The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me? 
\v 2 How long shall I take counsel in my soul, \add having\add* sorrow in my heart daily? how long shall my enemy be exalted over me? 
\v 3 Consider \add and\add* hear me, O LORD my God: lighten my eyes, lest I sleep \add the sleep\add* of death; 
\v 4 Lest my enemy say, I have prevailed against him; \add and\add* those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved. 
\v 5 But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation. 
\v 6 I will sing to the LORD, because he hath dealt bountifully with me. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1 To the chief Musician, \add A Psalm\add* of David. The fool hath said in his heart, \add There is\add* no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, \add there is\add* none that doeth good. 
\v 2 The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, \add and\add* seek God. 
\v 3 They are all gone aside, they are \add all\add* together become filthy: \add there is\add* none that doeth good, no, not one. 
\v 4 Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people \add as\add* they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD. 
\v 5 There were they in great fear: for God \add is\add* in the generation of the righteous. 
\v 6 Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD \add is\add* his refuge. 
\v 7 Oh that the salvation of Israel \add were come\add* out of Zion! when the LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, \add and\add* Israel shall be glad. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1 A Psalm of David. LORD, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill? 
\v 2 He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart. 
\v 3  \add He that\add* backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbor, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbor. 
\v 4 In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoreth them that fear the LORD. \add He that\add* sweareth to \add his own\add* hurt, and changeth not. 
\v 5  \add He that\add* putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these \add things\add* shall never be moved. 
\c 16  
\p
\v 1 Michtam of David. Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust. 
\v 2  \add O my soul\add* , thou hast said to the LORD, Thou \add art\add* my LORD: my goodness \add extendeth\add* not to thee; 
\v 3  \add But\add* to the saints that \add are\add* in the earth, and \add to\add* the excellent, in whom \add is\add* all my delight. 
\v 4 Their sorrows shall be multiplied \add that\add* hasten \add after\add* another \add god\add* : their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take their names into my lips. 
\v 5 The LORD \add is\add* the portion of my inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot. 
\v 6 The lines have fallen to me in pleasant \add places\add* ; yes, I have a goodly heritage. 
\v 7 I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night season. 
\v 8 I have set the LORD always before me: because \add he is\add* at my right hand, I shall not be moved. 
\v 9 Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope. 
\v 10 For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thy Holy One to see corruption. 
\v 11 Thou wilt show me the path of life: in thy presence \add is\add* fullness of joy; at thy right hand \add are\add* pleasures for evermore. 
\c 17  
\p
\v 1 A Prayer of David. Hear the right, O LORD, attend to my cry, give ear to my prayer, \add that goeth\add* not out of feigned lips. 
\v 2 Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thy eyes behold the things that are equal. 
\v 3 Thou hast proved my heart; thou hast visited \add me\add* in the night; thou hast tried me, \add and\add* shalt find nothing; I have purposed \add that\add* my mouth shall not transgress. 
\v 4 Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept \add me from\add* the paths of the destroyer. 
\v 5 Uphold my goings in thy paths, \add that\add* my footsteps slip not. 
\v 6 I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline thy ear to me, \add and hear\add* my speech. 
\v 7 Show thy wonderful loving-kindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them who put their trust \add in thee\add* from those that rise up \add against them\add* . 
\v 8 Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shade of thy wings. 
\v 9 From the wicked that oppress me, \add from\add* my deadly enemies, \add who\add* encompass me, 
\v 10 They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly. 
\v 11 They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth; 
\v 12 Like as a lion \add that\add* is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places. 
\v 13 Arise, O LORD disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked, \add who is\add* thy sword: 
\v 14 From men \add who are\add* thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world, \add who have\add* their portion in \add this\add* life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid \add treasure\add* : they are full of children, and leave the rest of their \add substance\add* to their babes. 
\v 15 As for me, I shall behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness. 
\c 18  
\p
\v 1 To the chief Musician, \add A Psalm\add* of David, the servant of the LORD, who spoke to the LORD the words of this song in the day \add that\add* the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul: And he said, I will love thee, O LORD, my strength. 
\v 2 The LORD \add is\add* my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, \add and\add* my high tower. 
\v 3 I will call upon the LORD, \add who is worthy\add* to be praised: so shall I be saved from my enemies. 
\v 4 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid. 
\v 5 The sorrows of hell encompassed me: the snares of death seized me. 
\v 6 In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, \add even\add* into his ears. 
\v 7 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth. 
\v 8 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it. 
\v 9 He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness \add was\add* under his feet. 
\v 10 And he rode upon a cherub, and flew; yes, he flew upon the wings of the wind. 
\v 11 He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion around him \add were\add* dark waters \add and\add* thick clouds of the skies. 
\v 12 At the brightness \add that was\add* before him his thick clouds passed, hail \add stones\add* and coals of fire. 
\v 13 The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail \add stones\add* and coals of fire. 
\v 14 Yes, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them. 
\v 15 Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were uncovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils. 
\v 16 He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters. 
\v 17 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them who hated me: for they were too strong for me. 
\v 18 They attacked me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay. 
\v 19 He brought me forth also in a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me. 
\v 20 The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me. 
\v 21 For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God. 
\v 22 For all his judgments \add were\add* before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me. 
\v 23 I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from my iniquity. 
\v 24 Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his sight. 
\v 25 With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt show thyself upright; 
\v 26 With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt contend. 
\v 27 For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks. 
\v 28 For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness. 
\v 29 For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall. 
\v 30  \add As for\add* God, his way \add is\add* perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he \add is\add* a buckler to all those that trust in him. 
\v 31 For who \add is\add* God save the LORD? or who \add is\add* a rock save our God? 
\v 32  \add It is\add* God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect. 
\v 33 He maketh my feet like hinds' \add feet\add* , and setteth me upon my high places. 
\v 34 He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by my arms. 
\v 35 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath held me up and thy gentleness hath made me great. 
\v 36 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip. 
\v 37 I have pursued my enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed. 
\v 38 I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they have fallen under my feet. 
\v 39 For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me. 
\v 40 Thou hast also given me the necks of my enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me. 
\v 41 They cried, but \add there was\add* none to save \add them\add* : \add even\add* to the LORD, but he answered them not. 
\v 42 Then I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I cast them out as the dirt in the streets. 
\v 43 Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; \add and\add* thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people \add whom\add* I have not known shall serve me. 
\v 44 As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves to me. 
\v 45 The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid from their close places. 
\v 46 The LORD liveth; and blessed \add be\add* my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted. 
\v 47  \add It is\add* God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me. 
\v 48 He delivereth me from my enemies: yes, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man. 
\v 49 Therefore will I give thanks to thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises to thy name. 
\v 50 He giveth great deliverance to his king; and showeth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for ever.

\v 1 To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament showeth the work of his hands. 
\v 2 Day to day uttereth speech, and night to night showeth knowledge. 
\v 3  \add There is\add* no speech nor language, \add where\add* their voice is not heard. 
\v 4 Their line hath gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun, 
\v 5 Which \add is\add* as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, \add and\add* rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race. 
\v 6 His going forth \add is\add* from the end of the heaven, and his circuit to the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from his heat. 
\v 7 The law of the LORD \add is\add* perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD \add is\add* sure, making wise the simple. 
\v 8 The statutes of the LORD \add are\add* right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD \add is\add* pure, enlightening the eyes. 
\v 9 The fear of the LORD \add is\add* clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the LORD \add are\add* true \add and\add* righteous altogether. 
\v 10 More to be desired \add are they\add* than gold, yes, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honey-comb. 
\v 11 Moreover, by them is thy servant warned: \add and\add* in keeping of them \add there is\add* great reward. 
\v 12 Who can understand \add his\add* errors? cleanse thou me from secret \add faults\add* . 
\v 13 Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous \add sins\add* ; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression. 
\v 14 Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer.

\v 1 To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob defend thee. 
\v 2 Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of Zion. 
\v 3 Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt-sacrifice. Selah. 
\v 4 Grant thee according to thy own heart, and fulfill all thy counsel. 
\v 5 We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up \add our\add* banners: the LORD fulfill all thy petitions. 
\v 6 Now I know that the LORD saveth his anointed; he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand. 
\v 7 Some \add trust\add* in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the name of the LORD our God. 
\v 8 They are brought down and fallen: but we are raised, and stand upright.

\v 1 To the chief Musician, a Psalm of David. The king shall joy in thy strength, O LORD; and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice! 
\v 2 Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not withheld the request of his lips. Selah. 
\v 3 For thou hast met him with the blessings of goodness: thou hast set a crown of pure gold on his head. 
\v 4 He asked life of thee, \add and\add* thou gavest \add it\add* to him, \add even\add* length of days for ever and ever. 
\v 5 His glory \add is\add* great in thy salvation: honor and majesty hast thou laid upon him. 
\v 6 For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance. 
\v 7 For the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved. 
\v 8 Thy hand shall find out all thy enemies: thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee. 
\v 9 Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thy anger: the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them. 
\v 10 Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men. 
\v 11 For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a mischievous device, \add which\add* they are not able \add to perform\add* . 
\v 12 Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, \add when\add* thou shalt make ready \add thy arrows\add* upon thy strings against the face of them. 
\v 13 Be thou exalted, LORD, in thy own strength: \add so\add* will we sing and praise thy power.

\v 1 To the chief Musician upon Aijeleth Shahar, A Psalm of David. My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? \add why art thou so far\add* from helping me, \add and from\add* the words of my roaring? 
\v 2 O my God, I cry in the day-time, but thou hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent. 
\v 3 But thou \add art\add* holy, \add O thou\add* that inhabitest the praises of Israel. 
\v 4 Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver them. 
\v 5 They cried to thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee, and were not confounded. 
\v 6 But I \add am\add* a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised by the people. 
\v 7 All they that see me deride me: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, \add saying\add* , 
\v 8 He trusted on the LORD \add that\add* he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him. 
\v 9 But thou \add art\add* he that brought me forth into life: thou didst make me hope \add when I was\add* upon my mother's breasts. 
\v 10 I was cast upon thee from my birth: thou \add art\add* my God from the time I was born. 
\v 11 Be not far from me; for trouble \add is\add* near; for \add there is\add* none to help. 
\v 12 Many bulls have compassed me: strong \add bulls\add* of Bashan have beset me round. 
\v 13 They gaped upon me \add with\add* their mouths, \add as\add* a ravening and a roaring lion. 
\v 14 I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels. 
\v 15 My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death. 
\v 16 For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet. 
\v 17 I may number all my bones: they look \add and\add* stare upon me. 
\v 18 They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture. 
\v 19 But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste thee to help me. 
\v 20 Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog. 
\v 21 Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns. 
\v 22 I will declare thy name to my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee. 
\v 23 Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel. 
\v 24 For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried to him, he heard. 
\v 25 My praise \add shall be\add* of thee in the great congregation: I will pay my vows before them that fear him. 
\v 26 The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for ever. 
\v 27 All the ends of the world shall remember and turn to the LORD: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee. 
\v 28 For the kingdom \add is\add* the LORD'S: and he \add is\add* the governor among the nations. 
\v 29 All \add they that are\add* fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none can keep alive his own soul. 
\v 30 A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the LORD for a generation. 
\v 31 They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness to a people that shall be born, that he hath done \add this\add* .

\v 1 A Psalm of David. The LORD \add is\add* my shepherd; I shall not want. 
\v 2 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters. 
\v 3 He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. 
\v 4 Yes, though I walk through the valley of the shades of death, I will fear no evil: for thou \add art\add* with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. 
\v 5 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. 
\v 6 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.

\v 1 A Psalm of David. The earth \add is\add* the LORD'S, and the fullness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein. 
\v 2 For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods. 
\v 3 Who shall ascend upon the hill of the LORD? and who shall stand in his holy place? 
\v 4 He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul to vanity, nor sworn deceitfully. 
\v 5 He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and righteousness from the God of his salvation. 
\v 6 This \add is\add* the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face, O Jacob. Selah.

\v 1  \add A Psalm\add* of David. To thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul. 
\v 2 O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not my enemies triumph over me, 
\v 3 Also, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: let them be ashamed who transgress without cause. 
\v 4 Show me thy ways, O LORD; teach me thy paths. 
\v 5 Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou \add art\add* the God of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day. 
\v 6 Remember, O LORD, thy tender mercies and thy loving kindnesses; for they \add have been\add* ever of old. 
\v 7 Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness' sake, O LORD. 
\v 8 Good and upright \add is\add* the LORD: therefore will he teach sinners in the way. 
\v 9 The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way. 
\v 10 All the paths of the LORD \add are\add* mercy and truth to such as keep his covenant and his testimonies. 
\v 11 For thy name's sake, O LORD, pardon my iniquity; for it \add is\add* great. 
\v 12 What man \add is\add* he that feareth the LORD? him shall he teach in the way \add that\add* he shall choose. 
\v 13 His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the earth. 
\v 14 The secret of the LORD \add is\add* with them that fear him; and he will show them his covenant. 
\v 15 My eyes \add are\add* ever towards the LORD; for he will pluck my feet out of the net. 
\v 16 Turn thee to me, and have mercy upon me; for I \add am\add* desolate and afflicted. 
\v 17 The troubles of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of my distresses. 
\v 18 Look upon my affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins. 
\v 19 Consider my enemies, for they are many; and they hate me with cruel hatred. 
\v 20 O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I put my trust in thee. 
\v 21 Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee.

\v 3 For thy loving-kindness \add is\add* before my eyes: and I have walked in thy truth. 
\v 4 I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers. 
\v 5 I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit with the wicked. 
\v 6 I will wash my hands in innocence: so will I compass thy altar, O LORD: 
\v 7 That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works. 
\v 8 LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thy honor dwelleth. 
\v 9 Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men:

\v 11 But as for me, I will walk in my integrity: redeem me, and be merciful to me. 
\v 12 My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I bless the LORD.

\v 1  \add A Psalm\add* of David. The LORD \add is\add* my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD \add is\add* the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? 
\v 2 When the wicked, \add even\add* my enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell. 
\v 3 Though a host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, in this \add will\add* I \add be\add* confident. 
\v 4 One \add thing\add* have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to inquire in his temple. 
\v 5 For in the time of trouble he will hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle will he hide me; he will set me up upon a rock. 
\v 6 And now shall my head be lifted above my enemies around me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yes, I will sing praises to the LORD. 
\v 7 Hear, O LORD, \add when\add* I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me, and answer me. 
\v 8  \add When thou saidst\add* , Seek ye my face; my heart said to thee, Thy face, LORD, will I seek. 
\v 9 Hide not thy face from me; put not thy servant away in anger: thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation. 
\v 10 When my father and my mother forsake me, then the LORD will take me up. 
\v 11 Teach me thy way, O LORD, and lead me in a plain path, because of my enemies. 
\v 12 Deliver me not over to the will of my enemies: for false witnesses have risen against me, and such as breathe out cruelty. 
\v 13  \add I had fainted\add* , unless I had believed to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living. 
\v 14 Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he will strengthen thy heart: wait, I say, on the LORD.

\v 1  \add A Psalm\add* of David. To thee will I cry, O LORD my rock; be not silent to me: lest, \add if\add* thou shouldst be silent to me, I should become like them that go down into the pit. 
\v 2 Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry to thee, when I lift my hands towards thy holy oracle. 
\v 3 Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity, who speak peace to their neighbors, but mischief \add is\add* in their hearts. 
\v 4 Give them according to their deeds, and according to the wickedness of their endeavors: give them after the work of their hands; render to them their desert. 
\v 5 Because they regard not the works of the LORD, nor the operation of his hands, he will destroy them, and not build them up. 
\v 6 Blessed \add be\add* the LORD, because he hath heard the voice of my supplications. 
\v 7 The LORD \add is\add* my strength, and my shield; my heart trusted in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I praise him.

\v 4 The voice of the LORD \add is\add* powerful; the voice of the LORD \add is\add* full of majesty. 
\v 5 The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yes, the LORD breaketh the cedars of Lebanon. 
\v 6 He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn. 
\v 7 The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire. 
\v 8 The voice of the LORD shaketh the wilderness; the LORD shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh. 
\v 9 The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve, and maketh bare the forests: and in his temple doth every one speak of \add his\add* glory. 
\v 10 The LORD sitteth upon the flood; yes, the LORD sitteth king for ever.

\v 1 A Psalm \add and\add* Song, \add at\add* the dedication of the house of David. I will extol thee, O LORD; for thou hast lifted me up, and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me. 
\v 2 O LORD my God, I cried to thee, and thou hast healed me. 
\v 3 O LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit. 
\v 4 Sing to the LORD, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness. 
\v 5 For his anger \add endureth but\add* a moment; in his favor \add is\add* life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy \add cometh\add* in the morning. 
\v 6 And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved. 
\v 7 LORD, by thy favor thou hast made my mountain to stand strong: thou didst hide thy face, \add and\add* I was troubled. 
\v 8 I cried to thee, O LORD; and to the LORD I made supplication. 
\v 9 What profit \add is there\add* in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth? 
\v 10 Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me: LORD, be thou my helper. 
\v 11 Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness; 
\v 12 To the end that \add my\add* glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks to thee for ever.

\v 1 To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed: deliver me in thy righteousness. 
\v 2 Bow down thy ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my strong rock, for a house of defense to save me. 
\v 3 For thou \add art\add* my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name's sake lead me, and guide me. 
\v 4 Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for thou \add art\add* my strength. 
\v 5 Into thy hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O LORD God of truth. 
\v 6 I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the LORD. 
\v 7 I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities; 
\v 8 And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast set my foot in a large room. 
\v 9 Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: my eye is consumed with grief, \add yes\add* , my soul and my belly. 
\v 10 For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my strength faileth because of my iniquity, and my bones are consumed. 
\v 11 I was a reproach among all my enemies, but especially among my neighbors, and a fear to my acquaintance: they that saw me without fled from me. 
\v 12 I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken vessel. 
\v 13 For I have heard the slander of many: fear \add was\add* on every side: while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life. 
\v 14 But I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou \add art\add* my God. 
\v 15 My times \add are\add* in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of my enemies, and from them that persecute me. 
\v 16 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy mercies' sake. 
\v 17 Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee: let the wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in the grave. 
\v 18 Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous. 
\v 19  \add Oh\add* how great \add is\add* thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee; \add which\add* thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men! 
\v 20 Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues. 
\v 21 Blessed \add be\add* the LORD: for he hath showed me his wonderful kindness in a strong city. 
\v 22 For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thy eyes: nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried to thee. 
\v 23 O love the LORD, all ye his saints: \add for\add* the LORD preserveth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer. 
\v 24 Be of good courage, and he will strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the LORD.

\v 1  \add A Psalm\add* of David, Maschil. Blessed \add is he whose\add* transgression \add is\add* forgiven, \add whose\add* sin \add is\add* covered. 
\v 2 Blessed \add is\add* the man to whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit \add there is\add* no guile. 
\v 3 When I kept silence, my bones became old through my roaring all the day long. 
\v 4 For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drouth of summer. Selah. 
\v 5 I acknowledged my sin to thee, and my iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions to the LORD; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah. 
\v 6 For this shall every one that is godly pray to thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh to him. 
\v 7 Thou \add art\add* my hiding place; thou wilt preserve me from trouble; thou wilt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah. 
\v 8 I will instruct thee, and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with my eye. 
\v 9 Be ye not as the horse, \add or\add* as the mule, \add which\add* have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near to thee. 
\v 10 Many sorrows \add shall be\add* to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the LORD, mercy shall encompass him. 
\v 11 Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all \add ye that are\add* upright in heart. 
\c 33  
\p
\v 1 Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: \add for\add* praise is comely for the upright. 
\v 2 Praise the LORD with harp: sing to him with the psaltery \add and\add* an instrument of ten strings. 
\v 3 Sing to him a new song; play skillfully with a loud noise. 
\v 4 For the word of the LORD \add is\add* right; and all his works \add are done\add* in truth. 
\v 5 He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the goodness of the LORD. 
\v 6 By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth. 
\v 7 He gathereth the waters of the sea together as a heap: he layeth up the depth in store-houses. 
\v 8 Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him. 
\v 9 For he spoke, and it was \add done\add* ; he commanded, and it stood fast. 
\v 10 The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to naught: he maketh the devices of the people of no effect. 
\v 11 The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations. 
\v 12 Blessed \add is\add* the nation whose God \add is\add* the LORD; \add and\add* the people \add whom\add* he hath chosen for his own inheritance. 
\v 13 The LORD looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men. 
\v 14 From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth. 
\v 15 He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their works. 
\v 16 There is no king saved by the multitude of a host: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength. 
\v 17 A horse \add is\add* a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver \add any\add* by his great strength. 
\v 18 Behold, the eye of the LORD \add is\add* upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy; 
\v 19 To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine. 
\v 20 Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he \add is\add* our help and our shield. 
\v 21 For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name. 
\v 22 Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in thee.

\v 3 O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together. 
\v 4 I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears. 
\v 5 They looked to him, and were lightened: and their faces were not ashamed. 
\v 6 This poor man cried, and the LORD heard \add him\add* , and saved him out of all his troubles. 
\v 7 The angel of the LORD encampeth around them that fear him, and delivereth them.

\v 9 O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for \add there is\add* no want to them that fear him. 
\v 10 The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the LORD shall not want any good \add thing\add* . 
\v 11 Come, ye children, hearken to me; I will teach you the fear of the LORD. 
\v 12 What man \add is he that\add* desireth life, \add and\add* loveth \add many\add* days, that he may see good? 
\v 13 Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile. 
\v 14 Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it. 
\v 15 The eyes of the LORD \add are\add* upon the righteous, and his ears \add are open\add* to their cry. 
\v 16 The face of the LORD \add is\add* against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth. 
\v 17  \add The righteous\add* cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles. 
\v 18 The LORD \add is\add* nigh to them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as are of a contrite spirit. 
\v 19 Many \add are\add* the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD delivereth him out of them all. 
\v 20 He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken. 
\v 21 Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate. 
\v 22 The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate.

\v 1  \add A Psalm\add* of David. Plead \add my cause\add* , O LORD, with them that strive with me: fight against them that fight against me. 
\v 2 Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for my help. 
\v 3 Draw out also the spear, and stop \add the way\add* against them that persecute me: say to my soul, I \add am\add* thy salvation. 
\v 4 Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt. 
\v 5 Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the LORD chase \add them\add* . 
\v 6 Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the LORD persecute them. 
\v 7 For without cause they have hid for me their net \add in\add* a pit, \add which\add* without cause they have digged for my soul. 
\v 8 Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let him fall. 
\v 9 And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD: it shall rejoice in his salvation. 
\v 10 All my bones shall say, LORD, who \add is\add* like thee, who deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, even the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him? 
\v 11 False witnesses arose; they laid to my charge \add things\add* that I knew not. 
\v 12 They rewarded me evil for good \add to\add* the spoiling of my soul. 
\v 13 But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing \add was\add* sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into my own bosom. 
\v 14 I behaved myself as though \add he had been\add* my friend \add or\add* brother: I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth \add for his\add* mother. 
\v 15 But in my adversity they rejoiced, and assembled themselves: \add yes\add* , the abjects assembled themselves against me, and I knew \add it\add* not; they did tear \add me\add* , and ceased not: 
\v 16 With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their teeth. 
\v 17 LORD, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their destructions, my darling from the lions. 
\v 18 I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise thee among many people. 
\v 19 Let not them that are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: \add neither\add* let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause. 
\v 20 For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters against \add them that are\add* quiet in the land. 
\v 21 Yes, they opened their mouth wide against me, \add and\add* said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen \add it\add* . 
\v 22  \add This\add* thou hast seen, O LORD: keep not silence: O LORD, be not far from me. 
\v 23 Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, \add even\add* to my cause, my God and my LORD. 
\v 24 Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; and let them not rejoice over me. 
\v 25 Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let them not say, We have swallowed him up. 
\v 26 Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at my hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonor that magnify \add themselves\add* against me. 
\v 27 Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favor my righteous cause: yes, let them say continually, Let the LORD be magnified, who hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant. 
\v 28 And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness \add and\add* of thy praise all the day long.

\v 1 To the chief Musician, \add A Psalm\add* of David the servant of the LORD. The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, \add that there is\add* no fear of God before his eyes. 
\v 2 For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity is found to be hateful. 
\v 3 The words of his mouth \add are\add* iniquity and deceit: he hath ceased to be wise, \add and\add* to do good. 
\v 4 He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way \add that is\add* not good; he abhorreth not evil. 
\v 5 Thy mercy, O LORD, \add is\add* in the heavens; \add and\add* thy faithfulness \add reacheth\add* to the clouds. 
\v 6 Thy righteousness \add is\add* like the great mountains; thy judgments \add are\add* a great deep: O LORD, thou preservest man and beast. 
\v 7 How excellent \add is\add* thy loving-kindness, O God! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings. 
\v 8 They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures. 
\v 9 For with thee \add is\add* the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light. 
\v 10 O continue thy loving-kindness to them that know thee; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart. 
\v 11 Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked remove me. 
\v 12 There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast down, and shall not be able to rise. 
\c 37  
\p
\v 1  \add A Psalm\add* of David. Fret not thyself because of evil doers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity. 
\v 2 For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb. 
\v 3 Trust in the LORD, and do good; \add so\add* shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed. 
\v 4 Delight thyself also in the LORD; and he will give thee the desires of thy heart. 
\v 5 Commit thy way to the LORD; trust also in him; and he will bring \add it\add* to pass. 
\v 6 And he will bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noon-day. 
\v 7 Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass. 
\v 8 Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise to do evil. 
\v 9 For evil doers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth. 
\v 10 For yet a little while, and the wicked \add shall\add* not \add be\add* : yes, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it \add shall\add* not \add be\add* . 
\v 11 But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace. 
\v 12 The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth. 
\v 13 The LORD will laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming. 
\v 14 The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, \add and\add* to slay such as are of upright deportment. 
\v 15 Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken. 
\v 16 A little that a righteous man hath \add is\add* better than the riches of many wicked. 
\v 17 For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD upholdeth the righteous. 
\v 18 The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall be for ever. 
\v 19 They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied. 
\v 20 But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD \add shall be\add* as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away. 
\v 21 The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous showeth mercy, and giveth. 
\v 22 For \add such as are\add* blessed by him shall inherit the earth; and \add they that are\add* cursed by him shall be cut off. 
\v 23 The steps of a \add good\add* man are ordered by the LORD: and he delighteth in his way. 
\v 24 Though he should fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD upholdeth \add him with\add* his hand. 
\v 25 I have been young, and \add now\add* am old; yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread. 
\v 26  \add He is\add* ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed \add is\add* blessed. 
\v 27 Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore. 
\v 28 For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off. 
\v 29 The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever. 
\v 30 The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment. 
\v 31 The law of his God \add is\add* in his heart; none of his steps shall slide. 
\v 32 The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him. 
\v 33 The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged. 
\v 34 Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he will exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see \add it\add* . 
\v 35 I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree. 
\v 36 Yet he passed away, and lo, he \add was\add* not: yes, I sought him, but he could not be found. 
\v 37 Mark the perfect \add man\add* , and behold the upright: for the end of \add that\add* man \add is\add* peace. 
\v 38 But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off. 
\v 39 But the salvation of the righteous \add is\add* of the LORD: \add he is\add* their strength in the time of trouble. 
\v 40 And the LORD will help them, and deliver them: he will deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.

\v 1 A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance. O LORD, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. 
\v 2 For thy arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand falleth heavy upon me. 
\v 3  \add There is\add* no soundness in my flesh because of thy anger; neither \add is there any\add* rest in my bones because of my sin. 
\v 4 For my iniquities have gone over my head: as a heavy burden they are too heavy for me. 
\v 5 My wounds are offensive, \add and\add* are corrupt because of my foolishness. 
\v 6 I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long. 
\v 7 For my loins are filled with a lothsome \add disease\add* : and \add there is\add* no soundness in my flesh. 
\v 8 I am feeble and grievously broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart. 
\v 9 LORD, all my desire \add is\add* before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee. 
\v 10 My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of my eyes, that also is gone from me. 
\v 11 My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my affliction; and my kinsmen stand afar off. 
\v 12 They also that seek after my life lay snares \add for me\add* : and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long. 
\v 13 But I, as a deaf \add man\add* , heard not; and \add I was\add* as a dumb man \add that\add* openeth not his mouth. 
\v 14 Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth \add are\add* no reproofs. 
\v 15 For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O LORD my God. 
\v 16 For I said, \add Hear me\add* , lest \add otherwise\add* they should rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify \add themselves\add* against me. 
\v 17 For I \add am\add* ready to halt, and my sorrow \add is\add* continually before me. 
\v 18 For I will declare my iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin. 
\v 19 But my enemies \add are\add* lively, \add and\add* they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied. 
\v 20 They also that render evil for good are my adversaries; because I follow \add the thing that is\add* good. 
\v 21 Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me. 
\v 22 Make haste to help me, O LORD my salvation. 
\c 39  
\p
\v 1 To the chief Musician, \add even\add* to Jeduthun, A Psalm of David. I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me. 
\v 2 I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, \add even\add* from good; and my sorrow was stirred. 
\v 3 My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned: \add then\add* I spoke with my tongue. 
\v 4 LORD, make me to know my end, and the measure of my days, what it \add is\add* ; \add that\add* I may know how frail I \add am\add* . 
\v 5 Behold, thou hast made my days \add as\add* a hand-breadth; and my age \add is\add* as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state \add is\add* altogether vanity. Selah. 
\v 6 Surely every man walketh in a vain show: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up \add riches\add* , and knoweth not who shall gather them. 
\v 7 And now, LORD, what wait I for? my hope \add is\add* in thee. 
\v 8 Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach of the foolish. 
\v 9 I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst \add it\add* . 
\v 10 Remove thy stroke away from me; I am consumed by the blow of thy hand. 
\v 11 When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every man \add is\add* vanity. Selah. 
\v 12 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear to my cry; hold not thy peace at my tears: for I \add am\add* a stranger with thee, \add and\add* a sojourner, as all my fathers \add were\add* . 
\v 13 O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and be no more. 
\c 40  
\p
\v 1 To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined to me, and heard my cry. 
\v 2 He brought me up also out of a horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, \add and\add* established my goings. 
\v 3 And he hath put a new song in my mouth, \add even\add* praise to our God: many shall see \add it\add* , and fear, and shall trust in the LORD. 
\v 4 Blessed \add is\add* that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies. 
\v 5 Many, O LORD, my God, \add are\add* thy wonderful works \add which\add* thou hast done, and thy thoughts \add which are\add* toward us, they cannot be reckoned up in order to thee: \add if\add* I would declare and speak \add of them\add* , they are more than can be numbered. 
\v 6 Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; my ears hast thou opened: burnt-offering and sin-offering hast thou not required. 
\v 7 Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book \add it is\add* written of me, 
\v 8 I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law \add is\add* within my heart. 
\v 9 I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest. 
\v 10 I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy loving-kindness and thy truth from the great congregation. 
\v 11 Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy loving-kindness and thy truth continually preserve me. 
\v 12 For innumerable evils have encompassed me: my iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of my head: therefore my heart faileth me. 
\v 13 Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help me. 
\v 14 Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil. 
\v 15 Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say to me, Aha, aha. 
\v 16 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be magnified. 
\v 17 But I \add am\add* poor and needy; \add yet\add* the LORD thinketh upon me: thou \add art\add* my help and my deliverer; make no delay, O my God. 
\c 41  
\p
\v 1 To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. Blessed \add is\add* he that considereth the poor: the LORD will deliver him in the time of trouble. 
\v 2 The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; \add and\add* he shall be blessed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him to the will of his enemies. 
\v 3 The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness. 
\v 4 I said, LORD, be merciful to me: heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee. 
\v 5 My enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name perish? 
\v 6 And if he cometh to see \add me\add* , he speaketh vanity: his heart gathereth iniquity to itself; \add when\add* he goeth abroad, he telleth \add it\add* . 
\v 7 All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they devise my hurt. 
\v 8 An evil disease, \add say they\add* , cleaveth fast to him: and \add now\add* that he lieth he shall rise no more. 
\v 9 Yes, my own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, who ate of my bread, hath lifted up \add his\add* heel against me. 
\v 10 But thou, O LORD, be merciful to me, and raise me up, that I may requite them. 
\v 11 By this I know that thou favorest me, because my enemy doth not triumph over me. 
\v 12 And as for me, thou upholdest me in my integrity, and settest me before thy face for ever. 
\v 13 Blessed \add be\add* the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting. Amen, and amen.

\v 1 To the chief Musician, Maschil, for the sons of Korah. As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so my soul panteth after thee, O God. 
\v 2 My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God? 
\v 3 My tears have been my food day and night, while they continually say to me, Where \add is\add* thy God? 
\v 4 When I remember these \add things\add* , I pour out my soul in me: for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holy-day. 
\v 5 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and \add why\add* art thou disquieted in me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him \add for\add* the help of his countenance. 
\v 6 O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the hill Mizar. 
\v 7 Deep calleth to deep at the noise of thy water-spouts: all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me. 
\v 8  \add Yet\add* the LORD will command his loving-kindness in the day-time, and in the night his song \add shall be\add* with me, \add and\add* my prayer to the God of my life. 
\v 9 I will say to God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy? 
\v 10  \add As\add* with a sword in my bones, my enemies reproach me; while they say daily to me, Where \add is\add* thy God? 
\v 11 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, \add who is\add* the health of my countenance, and my God. 
\c 43

\v 1 Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation: O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man. 
\v 2 For thou \add art\add* the God of my strength: why dost thou cast me off? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy? 
\v 3 O send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me; let them bring me to thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles. 
\v 4 Then will I go to the altar of God, to God, my exceeding joy: yes, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my God. 
\v 5 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope in God: for I shall yet praise him, \add who\add* is the health of my countenance, and my God.

\v 1 To the chief Musician for the sons of Korah, Maschil. We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, \add what\add* work thou didst in their days, in the times of old. 
\v 2  \add How\add* thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and didst plant them; \add how\add* thou didst afflict the people, and cast them out. 
\v 3 For they obtained not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thy arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favor to them. 
\v 4 Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob. 
\v 5 Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name we will tread them under that rise up against us. 
\v 6 For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me. 
\v 7 But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to shame that hated us. 
\v 8 In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for ever. Selah. 
\v 9 But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not forth with our armies. 
\v 10 Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they who hate us plunder for themselves. 
\v 11 Thou hast given us like sheep \add appointed\add* for food; and hast scattered us among the heathen. 
\v 12 Thou sellest thy people for naught, and dost not increase \add thy wealth\add* by their price. 
\v 13 Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbors, a scorn and a derision to them that are around us. 
\v 14 Thou makest us a by-word among the heathen, a shaking of the head among the people. 
\v 15 My confusion \add is\add* continually before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me, 
\v 16 For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and avenger. 
\v 17 All this is come upon us; yet we have not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant. 
\v 18 Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way; 
\v 19 Though thou hast severely broke us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shades of death. 
\v 20 If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god; 
\v 21 Will not God search out this? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart. 
\v 22 Yes, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter. 
\v 23 Awake, why sleepest thou, O LORD? arise, cast \add us\add* not off for ever. 
\v 24 Why hidest thou thy face, \add and\add* forgettest our affliction and our oppression? 
\v 25 For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth to the earth. 
\v 26 Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies' sake.

\v 1 To the chief Musician upon Shoshannim, for the sons of Korah, Maschil, A Song of loves. My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things which I have made concerning the king: my tongue \add is\add* the pen of a ready writer. 
\v 2 Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever. 
\v 3 Gird thy sword upon \add thy\add* thigh, O \add most\add* mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty. 
\v 4 And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness \add and\add* righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things. 
\v 5 Thy arrows \add are\add* sharp in the heart of the king's enemies; \add by which\add* the people fall under thee. 
\v 6 Thy throne, O God, \add is\add* for ever and ever: the scepter of thy kingdom \add is\add* a scepter of justice. 
\v 7 Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. 
\v 8 All thy garments \add smell\add* of myrrh, and aloes, \add and\add* cassia, out of the ivory palaces, by which they have made thee glad. 
\v 9 Kings daughters \add were\add* among thy honorable women: upon thy right hand stood the queen in gold of Ophir. 
\v 10 Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thy ear; forget also thy own people, and thy father's house; 
\v 11 So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he \add is\add* thy lord; and worship thou him. 
\v 12 And the daughter of Tyre \add shall be there\add* with a gift; \add even\add* the rich among the people shall entreat thy favor. 
\v 13 The king's daughter \add is\add* all glorious within: her clothing \add is\add* of wrought gold. 
\v 14 She shall be brought to the king in raiment of needlework: the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought to thee. 
\v 15 With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall enter into the king's palace. 
\v 16 Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth. 
\v 17 I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.

\v 3  \add Though\add* its waters shall roar \add and\add* be disturbed, \add though\add* the mountains shake with the swelling of it. Selah. 
\v 4  \add There is\add* a river, the streams of which shall make glad the city of God, the holy \add place\add* of the tabernacles of the Most High.

\v 6 The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted.

\v 8 Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath made in the earth. 
\v 9 He maketh wars to cease to the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear asunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire. 
\v 10 Be still, and know that I \add am\add* God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth. 
\v 11 The LORD of hosts \add is\add* with us; the God of Jacob \add is\add* our refuge. Selah.

\v 1 To the chief Musician, A Psalm for the sons of Korah. O clap your hands, all ye people; shout to God with the voice of triumph. 
\v 2 For the LORD most high \add is\add* terrible; \add he is\add* a great King over all the earth. 
\v 3 He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our feet. 
\v 4 He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellence of Jacob whom he loved. Selah. 
\v 5 God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a trumpet. 
\v 6 Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises to our King, sing praises. 
\v 7 For God \add is\add* the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with understanding. 
\v 8 God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness. 
\v 9 The princes of the people are assembled, \add even\add* the people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth \add belong\add* to God: he is greatly exalted.

\v 1 A Song \add and\add* Psalm for the sons of Korah. Great \add is\add* the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, \add in\add* the mountain of his holiness. 
\v 2 Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, \add is\add* mount Zion, \add on\add* the sides of the north, the city of the great King. 
\v 3 God is known in her palaces for a refuge. 
\v 4 For lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by together. 
\v 5 They saw \add it\add* , \add and\add* so they wondered; they were troubled, \add and\add* hasted away. 
\v 6 Fear took hold upon them there, \add and\add* pain, as of a woman in travail. 
\v 7 Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind. 
\v 8 As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever. Selah. 
\v 9 We have thought of thy loving-kindness, O God, in the midst of thy temple. 
\v 10 According to thy name, O God, so \add is\add* thy praise to the ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness. 
\v 11 Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad, because of thy judgments. 
\v 12 Walk about Zion, and go round her: number her towers. 
\v 13 Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may tell \add it\add* to the generation following. 
\v 14 For this God \add is\add* our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide \add even\add* to death.

\v 1 To the chief Musician, A Psalm for the sons of Korah. Hear this, all \add ye\add* people; give ear, all \add ye\add* inhabitants of the world: 
\v 2 Both low and high, rich and poor together. 
\v 3 My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart \add shall be\add* of understanding. 
\v 4 I will incline my ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp. 
\v 5 Why should I fear in the days of evil, \add when\add* the iniquity of my heels shall encompass me? 
\v 6 They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches; 
\v 7 None \add of them\add* can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him: 
\v 8 (For the redemption of their soul \add is\add* precious, and it ceaseth for ever:) 
\v 9 That he should still live for ever, \add and\add* not see corruption. 
\v 10 For he seeth \add that\add* wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others. 
\v 11 Their inward thought \add is\add* , \add that\add* their houses \add shall continue\add* for ever, \add and\add* their dwelling places to all generations; they call \add their\add* lands after their own names. 
\v 12 Nevertheless man \add being\add* in honor abideth not: he is like the beasts \add that\add* perish. 
\v 13 This their way \add is\add* their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah. 
\v 14 Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling. 
\v 15 But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah. 
\v 16 Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased; 
\v 17 For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him. 
\v 18 Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and \add men\add* will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself. 
\v 19 He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light. 
\v 20 Man \add that is\add* in honor, and understandeth not, is like the beasts \add that\add* perish.

\v 1 A Psalm of Asaph. The mighty God, \add even\add* the LORD, hath spoken, and called the earth from the rising to the setting of the sun. 
\v 2 Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined. 
\v 3 Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous around him. 
\v 4 He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people. 
\v 5 Gather my saints together to me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice. 
\v 6 And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God \add is\add* judge himself. Selah. 
\v 7 Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against thee: I \add am\add* God, \add even\add* thy God. 
\v 8 I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt-offerings, \add to have been\add* continually before me. 
\v 9 I will take no bullock out of thy house, \add nor\add* he-goats out of thy folds. 
\v 10 For every beast of the forest \add is\add* mine, \add and\add* the cattle upon a thousand hills. 
\v 11 I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field \add are\add* mine. 
\v 12 If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world \add is\add* mine, and the fullness thereof. 
\v 13 Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats? 
\v 14 Offer to God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows to the Most High: 
\v 15 And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me. 
\v 16 But to the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or \add that\add* thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth? 
\v 17 Seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest my words behind thee. 
\v 18 When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers. 
\v 19 Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit. 
\v 20 Thou sittest \add and\add* speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thy own mother's son. 
\v 21 These \add things\add* hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether \add such an one\add* as thyself: \add but\add* I will reprove thee, and set \add them\add* in order before thine eyes. 
\v 22 Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear \add you\add* in pieces, and \add there be\add* none to deliver. 
\v 23 Whoever offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth \add his\add* deportment \add aright\add* will I show the salvation of God.

\v 1 To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came to him, after he had gone in to Bath-sheba. Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy loving-kindness: according to the multitude of thy tender mercies, blot out my transgressions. 
\v 2 Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. 
\v 3 For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin \add is\add* ever before me. 
\v 4 Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done \add this\add* evil in thy sight: that thou mayest be justified when thou speakest, \add and\add* be clear when thou judgest. 
\v 5 Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me. 
\v 6 Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden \add part\add* thou shalt make me to know wisdom. 
\v 7 Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. 
\v 8 Make me to hear joy and gladness; \add that\add* the bones \add which\add* thou hast broken may rejoice. 
\v 9 Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities. 
\v 10 Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me. 
\v 11 Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me. 
\v 12 Restore to me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me \add with thy\add* free spirit. 
\v 13  \add Then\add* will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be converted to thee. 
\v 14 Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation: \add and\add* my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness. 
\v 15 O LORD, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall show forth thy praise. 
\v 16 For thou desirest not sacrifice: else would I give \add it\add* : thou delightest not in burnt-offering. 
\v 17 The sacrifices of God \add are\add* a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise. 
\v 18 Do good in thy good pleasure to Zion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem. 
\v 19 Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt-offering and whole burnt-offering: then shall they offer bullocks upon thy altar.

\v 1 To the chief Musician, Maschil, \add A Psalm\add* of David, when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, and said to him, David is come to the house of Ahimelech. Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? the goodness of God \add endureth\add* continually. 
\v 2 Thy tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp razor, working deceitfully. 
\v 3 Thou lovest evil more than good; \add and\add* lying rather than to speak righteousness. Selah. 
\v 4 Thou lovest all devouring words, O \add thou\add* deceitful tongue. 
\v 5 God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he shall take thee away, and pluck thee out of \add thy\add* dwelling-place, and root thee out of the land of the living. Selah. 
\v 6 The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him: 
\v 7 Lo, \add this is\add* the man \add that\add* made not God his strength; but trusted in the abundance of his riches, \add and\add* strengthened himself in his wickedness. 
\v 8 But I \add am\add* like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever. 
\v 9 I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done \add it\add* : and I will wait on thy name; for \add it is\add* good before thy saints. 
\c 53

\v 1 To the chief Musician upon Mahalath, Maschil, \add A Psalm\add* of David. The fool hath said in his heart, \add There is\add* no God. They are corrupt, and have done abominable iniquity: \add there is\add* none that doeth good. 
\v 2 God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were \add any\add* that did understand, that did seek God. 
\v 3 Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become filthy; \add there is\add* none that doeth good, no, not one. 
\v 4 Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people \add as\add* they eat bread! they have not called upon God. 
\v 5 There they were in great fear, \add where\add* no fear was: for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth \add against\add* thee: thou hast put \add them\add* to shame, because God hath despised them. 
\v 6 O that the salvation of Israel \add were come\add* out of Zion! when God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, \add and\add* Israel shall be glad.

\v 1 To the chief Musician on Neginoth, Maschil, \add A Psalm\add* of David, when the Ziphims came and said to Saul, Doth not David hide himself with us? Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength. 
\v 2 Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth. 
\v 3 For strangers have risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah. 
\v 4 Behold, God \add is\add* my helper: the LORD \add is\add* with them that uphold my soul. 
\v 5 He will reward evil to my enemies; cut them off in thy truth. 
\v 6 I will freely sacrifice to thee: I will praise thy name, O LORD; for \add it is\add* good. 
\v 7 For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and my eye hath seen \add its desire\add* upon my enemies. 
\c 55  
\p
\v 1 To the chief Musician on Neginoth, Maschil, \add A Psalm\add* of David. Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my supplication. 
\v 2 Attend to me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise; 
\v 3 Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me. 
\v 4 My heart is severely pained within me: and the terrors of death have fallen upon me. 
\v 5 Fearfulness and trembling have come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me. 
\v 6 And I said, O that I had wings like a dove! \add for then\add* I would fly away, and be at rest. 
\v 7 Lo, \add then\add* I would wander far off, \add and\add* remain in the wilderness. Selah. 
\v 8 I would hasten my escape from the windy storm \add and\add* tempest. 
\v 9 Destroy, O LORD, \add and\add* divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city. 
\v 10 Day and night they go about it upon its walls: mischief also and sorrow \add are\add* in the midst of it. 
\v 11 Wickedness \add is\add* in the midst of it: deceit and guile depart not from her streets. 
\v 12 For \add it was\add* not an enemy \add that\add* reproached me; then I could have borne \add it\add* : neither \add was it\add* he that hated me \add that\add* magnified \add himself\add* against me; then I would have hid myself from him: 
\v 13 But \add it was\add* thou, a man my equal, my guide, and my acquaintance. 
\v 14 We took sweet counsel together, \add and\add* walked to the house of God in company. 
\v 15 Let death seize upon them, \add and\add* let them go down quick into hell: for wickedness \add is\add* in their dwellings, \add and\add* among them. 
\v 16 As for me, I will call upon God: and the LORD will save me. 
\v 17 Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he will hear my voice. 
\v 18 He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle \add that was\add* against me: for there were many with me. 
\v 19 God will hear and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God. 
\v 20 He hath put forth his hands against such as are at peace with him: he hath broken his covenant. 
\v 21  \add The words\add* of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war \add was\add* in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet \add were\add* they drawn swords. 
\v 22 Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he will sustain thee: he will never suffer the righteous to be moved. 
\v 23 But thou, O God, wilt bring them down into the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee.

\v 1 To the chief Musician upon Jonathelem-rechokim, Michtam of David, when the Philistines took him in Gath. Be merciful to me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he fighting daily oppresseth me. 
\v 2 My enemies would daily swallow \add me\add* up: for \add they are\add* many that fight against me, O thou Most High. 
\v 3 In the time when I am afraid, I will trust in thee. 
\v 4 In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do to me. 
\v 5 Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts \add are\add* against me for evil. 
\v 6 They assemble themselves, they hide themselves, they mark my steps, when they wait for my soul. 
\v 7 Shall they escape by iniquity; in \add thy\add* anger cast down the people, O God. 
\v 8 Thou numberest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle: \add are they\add* not in thy book? 
\v 9 When I cry \add to thee\add* , then shall my enemies turn back: this I know; for God \add is\add* for me. 
\v 10 In God will I praise \add his\add* word: in the LORD will I praise \add his\add* word. 
\v 11 In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do to me. 
\v 12 Thy vows \add are\add* upon me, O God: I will render praises to thee. 
\v 13 For thou hast delivered my soul from death: \add wilt thou\add* not \add deliver\add* my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living? 
\c 57  
\p
\v 1 To the chief Musician, Al-taschith, Michtam of David, when he fled from Saul in the cave. Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful to me: for my soul trusteth in thee: yes, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until \add these\add* calamities are overpast. 
\v 2 I will cry to God most high; to God that performeth \add all things\add* for me. 
\v 3 He shall send from heaven, and save me \add from\add* the reproach of him that would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his mercy and his truth. 
\v 4 My soul \add is\add* among lions: \add and\add* I lie \add even among\add* them that are set on fire, \add even\add* the sons of men, whose teeth \add are\add* spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword. 
\v 5 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; \add let\add* thy glory \add be\add* above all the earth. 
\v 6 They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down: they have digged a pit before me, into the midst of which they have fallen \add themselves\add* . Selah. 
\v 7 My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give praise. 
\v 8 Awake, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I \add myself\add* will awake early. 
\v 9 I will praise thee, O LORD, among the people: I will sing to thee among the nations. 
\v 10 For thy mercy \add is\add* great to the heavens, and thy truth to the clouds. 
\v 11 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: \add let\add* thy glory \add be\add* above all the earth.

\v 1 To the chief Musician, Al-taschith, Michtam of David. Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men? 
\v 2 Yes, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth. 
\v 3 The wicked are estranged from their birth: they go astray as soon as they are born, speaking lies. 
\v 4 Their poison \add is\add* like the poison of a serpent: \add they are\add* like the deaf adder \add that\add* stoppeth her ear; 
\v 5 Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely. 
\v 6 Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great teeth of the young lions, O LORD. 
\v 7 Let them melt away as waters \add which\add* run continually: \add when\add* he bendeth \add his bow to shoot\add* his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces. 
\v 8 As a snail \add which\add* melteth, let \add every one of them\add* pass away: \add like\add* the untimely birth of a woman, \add that\add* they may not see the sun. 
\v 9 Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in \add his\add* wrath. 
\v 10 The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked. 
\v 11 So that a man shall say, Verily \add there is\add* a reward for the righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.

\v 1 To the chief Musician, Al-taschith, Michtam of David; when Saul sent, and they watched the house to kill him. Deliver me from my enemies, O my God: defend me from them that rise up against me. 
\v 2 Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody men. 
\v 3 For lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered against me; not \add for\add* my transgression, nor \add for\add* my sin, O LORD. 
\v 4 They run and prepare themselves without \add my\add* fault: awake to help me, and behold. 
\v 5 Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah. 
\v 6 They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go about the city. 
\v 7 Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords \add are\add* in their lips: for who, \add say they\add* , doth hear? 
\v 8 But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the heathen in derision. 
\v 9  \add Because of\add* his strength will I wait upon thee: for God \add is\add* my defense. 
\v 10 The God of my mercy will succor me: God will let me see \add my desire\add* upon my enemies. 
\v 11 Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy power; and bring them down, O LORD our shield. 
\v 12  \add For\add* the sin of their mouth \add and\add* the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying \add which\add* they speak. 
\v 13 Consume \add them\add* in wrath, consume \add them\add* , that they \add may\add* not \add be\add* : and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob to the ends of the earth. Selah. 
\v 14 And at evening let them return; \add and\add* let them make a noise like a dog, and go about the city. 
\v 15 Let them wander up and down for food, and grudge if they are not satisfied. 
\v 16 But I will sing of thy power; yes, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defense and refuge in the day of my trouble. 
\v 17 To thee, O my strength, will I sing: for God \add is\add* my defense, \add and\add* the God of my mercy.

\v 1 To the chief Musician upon Shushan-eduth, Michtam of David, to teach; when he strove with Aram-naharaim and with Aram-zobah, when Joab returned, and smote of Edom in the valley of salt twelve thousand. O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou hast been displeased; O turn thyself to us again. 
\v 2 Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal its breaches; for it shaketh. 
\v 3 Thou hast shown thy people hard things: thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment. 
\v 4 Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah. 
\v 5 That thy beloved may be delivered; save \add with\add* thy right hand, and hear me. 
\v 6 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and measure out the valley of Succoth. 
\v 7 Gilead \add is\add* mine, and Manasseh \add is\add* mine; Ephraim also \add is\add* the strength of my head; Judah \add is\add* my lawgiver;

\v 9 Who will bring me \add into\add* the strong city? who will lead me into Edom? 
\v 10  \add Wilt\add* thou not, O God, \add who\add* hadst cast us off? and \add thou\add* , O God, \add who\add* didst not go out with our armies?

\v 1 To the chief Musician upon Neginah, \add A Psalm\add* of David. Hear my cry, O God; attend to my prayer. 
\v 2 From the end of the earth will I cry to thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock \add that\add* is higher than I. 
\v 3 For thou hast been a shelter for me, \add and\add* a strong tower from the enemy. 
\v 4 I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert of thy wings. Selah. 
\v 5 For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given \add me\add* the heritage of those that fear thy name. 
\v 6 Thou wilt prolong the king's life: \add and\add* his years as many generations. 
\v 7 He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth, \add which\add* may preserve him. 
\v 8 So will I sing praise to thy name for ever, that I may daily perform my vows.

\v 1 To the chief Musician, to Jeduthun, A Psalm of David. Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him \add cometh\add* my salvation. 
\v 2 He only \add is\add* my rock and my salvation; \add he is\add* my defense; I shall not be greatly moved. 
\v 3 How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be slain all of you: as a bowing wall \add shall ye be\add* , \add and as\add* a tottering fence. 
\v 4 They only consult to cast \add him\add* down from his excellence: they delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah. 
\v 5 My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation \add is\add* from him. 
\v 6 He only \add is\add* my rock and my salvation: \add he is\add* my defense; I shall not be moved. 
\v 7 In God \add is\add* my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, \add and\add* my refuge, \add is\add* in God. 
\v 8 Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him: God \add is\add* a refuge for us. Selah. 
\v 9 Surely men of low degree \add are\add* vanity, \add and\add* men of high degree \add are\add* a lie: to be laid in the balance, they \add are\add* altogether \add lighter\add* than vanity. 
\v 10 Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your heart \add upon them\add* . 
\v 11 God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power \add belongeth\add* to God. 
\v 12 Also to thee, O LORD, \add belongeth\add* mercy: for thou renderest to every man according to his work.

\v 1 A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah. O God, thou \add art\add* my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is;

\v 3 Because thy loving-kindness \add is\add* better than life, my lips shall praise thee. 
\v 4 Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in thy name. 
\v 5 My soul shall be satisfied as \add with\add* marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise \add thee\add* with joyful lips: 
\v 6 When I remember thee upon my bed, \add and\add* meditate on thee in the \add night\add* watches. 
\v 7 Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice. 
\v 8 My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth me. 
\v 9 But those \add that\add* seek my soul to destroy \add it\add* , shall go into the lower parts of the earth. 
\v 10 They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for foxes. 
\v 11 But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by him shall glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.

\v 1 To the chief Musician, a Psalm of David. Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy. 
\v 2 Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity: 
\v 3 Who whet their tongue like a sword, \add and\add* bend \add their bows to shoot\add* their arrows, \add even\add* bitter words: 
\v 4 That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not. 
\v 5 They encourage themselves \add in\add* an evil matter: they commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who will see them? 
\v 6 They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search: both the inward \add thought\add* of every one \add of them\add* , and the heart, \add is\add* deep. 
\v 7 But God shall shoot at them \add with\add* an arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded. 
\v 8 So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: all that see them shall flee away. 
\v 9 And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for they shall wisely consider of his doing. 
\v 10 The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.

\v 1 To the chief Musician, A Psalm \add and\add* Song of David. Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Zion: and to thee shall the vow be performed. 
\v 2 O thou that hearest prayer, to thee shall all flesh come. 
\v 3 Iniquities prevail against me: \add as for\add* our transgressions, thou shalt purge them away. 
\v 4 Blessed \add is the man whom\add* thou choosest, and causest to approach \add to thee\add* , \add that\add* he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, \add even\add* of thy holy temple. 
\v 5  \add By\add* terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of our salvation; \add who art\add* the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are afar off \add upon\add* the sea: 
\v 6 Who by his strength setteth fast the mountains; \add being\add* girded with power: 
\v 7 Who stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people. 
\v 8 They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice. 
\v 9 Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God, \add which\add* is full of water: thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for it. 
\v 10 Thou waterest the ridges of it abundantly: thou settlest the furrows of it: thou makest it soft with showers: thou blessest the springing of it. 
\v 11 Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop fatness. 
\v 12 They drop \add upon\add* the pastures of the wilderness: and the little hills rejoice on every side. 
\v 13 The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.

\v 1 To the chief Musician, A Song \add or\add* Psalm. Make a joyful noise to God, all ye lands: 
\v 2 Sing forth the honor of his name: make his praise glorious. 
\v 3 Say to God, How terrible \add art thou in\add* thy works! through the greatness of thy power shall thy enemies submit themselves to thee. 
\v 4 All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing to thee; they shall sing \add to\add* thy name. Selah. 
\v 5 Come and see the works of God: \add he is\add* terrible \add in his\add* doing towards the children of men. 
\v 6 He turned the sea into dry \add land\add* : they went through the flood on foot: there we rejoiced in him. 
\v 7 He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah. 
\v 8 O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise to be heard: 
\v 9 Who holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to be moved. 
\v 10 For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silver is tried. 
\v 11 Thou hast brought us into the net; thou hast laid affliction upon our loins. 
\v 12 Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy \add place\add* . 
\v 13 I will go into thy house with burnt-offerings: I will pay thee my vows, 
\v 14 Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in trouble. 
\v 15 I will offer to thee burnt-sacrifices of fatlings, with the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah. 
\v 16 Come \add and\add* hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he hath done for my soul. 
\v 17 I cried to him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue. 
\v 18 If I regard iniquity in my heart, the LORD will not hear \add me\add* : 
\v 19  \add But\add* verily God hath heard \add me\add* ; he hath attended to the voice of my prayer.

\v 3 But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God: yes, let them exceedingly rejoice. 
\v 4 Sing to God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him. 
\v 5 A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, \add is\add* God in his holy habitation. 
\v 6 God setteth the solitary in families: he bringeth out those who are bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell in a dry \add land\add* . 
\v 7 O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou didst march through the wilderness; Selah: 
\v 8 The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God: \add even\add* Sinai itself \add was moved\add* at the presence of God, the God of Israel. 
\v 9 Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, by which thou didst confirm thy inheritance, when it was weary. 
\v 10 Thy congregation hath dwelt therein: thou, O God, hast prepared of thy goodness for the poor. 
\v 11 The LORD gave the word: great \add was\add* the company of those that published \add it\add* . 
\v 12 Kings of armies fled apace: and she that tarried at home divided the spoil. 
\v 13 Though ye have lain among the pots, \add yet shall ye be as\add* the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold. 
\v 14 When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was \add white\add* as snow in Salmon. 
\v 15 The hill of God \add is as\add* the hill of Bashan; a high hill \add as\add* the hill of Bashan. 
\v 16 Why leap ye, ye lofty hills? \add this is\add* the hill \add which\add* God desireth to dwell in; yes, the LORD will dwell \add in it\add* for ever. 
\v 17 The chariots of God \add are\add* twenty thousand, \add even\add* thousands of angels: the LORD \add is\add* among them, \add as in\add* Sinai, in the holy \add place\add* . 
\v 18 Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive: thou hast received gifts for men; yes, \add for\add* the rebellious also, that the LORD God might dwell \add among them\add* . 
\v 19 Blessed \add be\add* the LORD, \add who\add* daily loadeth us \add with benefits\add* , \add even\add* the God of our salvation. Selah. 
\v 20  \add He that is\add* our God \add is\add* the God of salvation; and to God the LORD \add belong\add* the issues from death. 
\v 21 But God will wound the head of his enemies, \add and\add* the hairy scalp of such one as goeth on still in his trespasses. 
\v 22 The LORD said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring \add my people\add* again from the depths of the sea. 
\v 23 That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thy enemies, \add and\add* the tongue of thy dogs in the same. 
\v 24 They have seen thy goings, O God; \add even\add* the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary. 
\v 25 The singers went before, the players on instruments \add followed\add* after; among \add them were\add* the damsels playing with timbrels. 
\v 26 Bless ye God in the congregations, \add even\add* the LORD, from the fountain of Israel. 
\v 27 There \add is\add* little Benjamin \add with\add* their ruler, the princes of Judah \add and\add* their counsel, the princes of Zebulun, \add and\add* the princes of Naphtali. 
\v 28 Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us. 
\v 29 Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents to thee. 
\v 30 Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the people, \add till every one shall\add* submit himself with pieces of silver: scatter thou the people \add that\add* delight in war.

\v 1 To the chief Musician upon Shoshannim, \add A Psalm\add* of David. Save me, O God; for the waters are come in to \add my\add* soul. 
\v 2 I sink in deep mire, where \add there is\add* no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me. 
\v 3 I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: my eyes fail while I wait for my God. 
\v 4 They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head: they that would destroy me, \add being\add* my enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored \add that\add* which I took not away. 
\v 5 O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee. 
\v 6 Let not them that wait on thee, O LORD God of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel. 
\v 7 Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face. 
\v 8 I am become a stranger to my brethren, and an alien to my mother's children. 
\v 9 For the zeal of thy house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee have fallen upon me. 
\v 10 When I wept, \add and chastened\add* my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach. 
\v 11 I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them. 
\v 12 They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I \add was\add* the song of the drunkards. 
\v 13 But as for me, my prayer \add is\add* to thee, O LORD, \add in\add* an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation. 
\v 14 Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters. 
\v 15 Let not the water-flood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me. 
\v 16 Hear me, O LORD; for thy loving-kindness \add is\add* good: turn to me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies. 
\v 17 And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily. 
\v 18 Draw nigh to my soul, \add and\add* redeem it: deliver me because of my enemies. 
\v 19 Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonor: my adversaries \add are\add* all before thee. 
\v 20 Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked \add for some\add* to take pity, but \add there was\add* none; and for comforters, but I found none. 
\v 21 They gave me also gall for my food; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink. 
\v 22 Let their table become a snare before them: and \add that which should have been\add* for \add their\add* welfare, \add let it become\add* a trap. 
\v 23 Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake. 
\v 24 Pour out thy indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them. 
\v 25 Let their habitation be desolate; \add and\add* let none dwell in their tents. 
\v 26 For they persecute \add him\add* whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded. 
\v 27 Add iniquity to their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousness. 
\v 28 Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous. 
\v 29 But I \add am\add* poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high. 
\v 30 I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving. 
\v 31  \add This\add* also shall please the LORD better than an ox \add or\add* bullock that hath horns and hoofs. 
\v 32 The humble shall see \add this\add* , \add and\add* be glad: and your heart shall live that seek God. 
\v 33 For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners. 
\v 34 Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein. 
\v 35 For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may dwell there, and have it in possession. 
\v 36 The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his name shall dwell therein.

\v 1 To the chief Musician, \add A Psalm\add* of David to bring to remembrance. \add Make haste\add* , O God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O LORD. 
\v 2 Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt. 
\v 3 Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, Aha, aha. 
\v 4 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified. 
\v 5 But I \add am\add* poor and needy: make haste to me, O God: thou \add art\add* my help and my deliverer; O LORD, make no delay. 
\c 71  
\p
\v 1 In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust: let me never be put to confusion. 
\v 2 Deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape: incline thy ear to me, and save me. 
\v 3 Be thou my strong habitation, to which I may continually resort: thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou \add art\add* my rock and my fortress. 
\v 4 Deliver me, O my God, from the hand of the wicked, from the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man. 
\v 5 For thou \add art\add* my hope, O LORD God: \add thou art\add* my trust from my youth. 
\v 6 By thee have I been sustained from my birth: thou art he that brought me into life: my praise \add shall be\add* continually of thee. 
\v 7 I am as a wonder to many; but thou \add art\add* my strong refuge. 
\v 8 Let my mouth be filled \add with\add* thy praise \add and with\add* thy honor all the day. 
\v 9 Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength faileth. 
\v 10 For my enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together, 
\v 11 Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for \add there is\add* none to deliver \add him\add* . 
\v 12 O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help. 
\v 13 Let them be confounded \add and\add* consumed that are adversaries to my soul; let them be covered \add with\add* reproach and dishonor that seek my hurt. 
\v 14 But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more. 
\v 15 My mouth shall show forth thy righteousness \add and\add* thy salvation all the day; for I know not the numbers \add thereof\add* . 
\v 16 I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention of thy righteousness, \add even\add* of thine only. 
\v 17 O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works. 
\v 18 Now also when I am old and gray-headed, O God, forsake me not; until I have shown thy strength to \add this\add* generation, \add and\add* thy power to every one \add that\add* is to come. 
\v 19 Thy righteousness also, O God, \add is\add* very high, who hast done great things: O God, who \add is\add* like to thee! 
\v 20  \add Thou\add* , who hast shown me great and severe troubles, wilt revive me again, and wilt bring me again from the depths of the earth. 
\v 21 Thou wilt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side. 
\v 22 I will also praise thee with the psaltery, \add even\add* thy truth, O my God: to thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel. 
\v 23 My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing to thee; and my soul, which thou hast redeemed. 
\v 24 My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: for they are confounded, for they are brought to shame, that seek my hurt.

\v 1  \add A Psalm\add* for Solomon. Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness to the king's son. 
\v 2 He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment. 
\v 3 The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills, by righteousness. 
\v 4 He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor. 
\v 5 They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout all generations. 
\v 6 He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers \add that\add* water the earth. 
\v 7 In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth. 
\v 8 He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river to the ends of the earth. 
\v 9 They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his enemies shall lick the dust. 
\v 10 The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts. 
\v 11 Yes, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall serve him. 
\v 12 For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and \add him\add* that hath no helper. 
\v 13 He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of the needy. 
\v 14 He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and precious shall be their blood in his sight. 
\v 15 And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually; \add and\add* daily shall he be praised. 
\v 16 There shall be a handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains; the fruit of it shall shake like Lebanon: and \add they\add* of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth. 
\v 17 His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as long as the sun: and \add men\add* shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call him blessed.

\v 1 A Psalm of Asaph. Truly God \add is\add* good to Israel, \add even\add* to such as are of a clean heart. 
\v 2 But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped. 
\v 3 For I was envious at the foolish, \add when\add* I saw the prosperity of the wicked. 
\v 4 For \add there are\add* no bands in their death: but their strength \add is\add* firm. 
\v 5 They \add are\add* not in trouble \add as other\add* men; neither are they afflicted like \add other\add* men. 
\v 6 Therefore pride encompasseth them as a chain; violence covereth them \add as\add* a garment. 
\v 7 Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish. 
\v 8 They are corrupt, and speak wickedly \add concerning\add* oppression: they speak loftily. 
\v 9 They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth. 
\v 10 Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full \add cup\add* are wrung out to them. 
\v 11 And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the Most High? 
\v 12 Behold, these \add are\add* the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase \add in\add* riches. 
\v 13 Verily I have cleansed my heart \add in\add* vain, and washed my hands in innocence. 
\v 14 For all the day long have I been afflicted, and chastened every morning. 
\v 15 If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend \add against\add* the generation of thy children. 
\v 16 When I thought to know this, it \add was\add* too painful for me; 
\v 17 Until I went into the sanctuary of God; \add then\add* I understood their end. 
\v 18 Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou didst cast them down into destruction. 
\v 19 How are they \add brought\add* into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors. 
\v 20 As a dream when \add one\add* awaketh; \add so\add* , O LORD, when thou awakest, thou wilt despise their image. 
\v 21 Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins. 
\v 22 So foolish \add was\add* I, and ignorant: I was \add as\add* a beast before thee. 
\v 23 Nevertheless I \add am\add* continually with thee: thou hast held \add me\add* by my right hand. 
\v 24 Thou wilt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me \add to\add* glory. 
\v 25 Whom have I in heaven \add but thee\add* ? and \add there is\add* none upon earth \add that\add* I desire besides thee. 
\v 26 My flesh and my heart faileth: \add but\add* God \add is\add* the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever. 
\v 27 For lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go astray from thee. 
\v 28 But \add it is\add* good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.

\v 1 Maschil of Asaph. O God, why hast thou cast \add us\add* off for ever? \add why\add* doth thy anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture? 
\v 2 Remember thy congregation, \add which\add* thou hast purchased of old: the rod of thy inheritance, \add which\add* thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion, in which thou hast dwelt. 
\v 3 Lift up thy feet to the perpetual desolations; \add even\add* all \add that\add* the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary. 
\v 4 Thy enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up their ensigns \add for\add* signs. 
\v 5  \add A man\add* was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees. 
\v 6 But now they break down the carved work of it at once with axes and hammers. 
\v 7 They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled \add by casting down\add* the dwelling-place of thy name to the ground. 
\v 8 They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land. 
\v 9 We see not our signs: \add there is\add* no more any prophet: neither \add is there\add* among us any that knoweth how long. 
\v 10 O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever? 
\v 11 Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck \add it\add* out of thy bosom. 
\v 12 For God \add is\add* my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth. 
\v 13 Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou didst break the heads of the dragons in the waters. 
\v 14 Thou didst break the head of leviathan in pieces, \add and\add* didst give him \add to be\add* food to the people inhabiting the wilderness. 
\v 15 Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou didst dry up mighty rivers. 
\v 16 The day \add is\add* thine, the night also \add is\add* thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun. 
\v 17 Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter. 
\v 18 Remember this, the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and the foolish people have blasphemed thy name. 
\v 19 O deliver not the soul of thy turtle dove to the multitude \add of the wicked\add* : forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever. 
\v 20 Have respect to the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty. 
\v 21 O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy praise thy name. 
\v 22 Arise, O God, plead thy own cause: remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily. 
\v 23 Forget not the voice of thy enemies: the tumult of those that rise against thee increaseth continually.

\v 6 For promotion \add cometh\add* neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south. 
\v 7 But God \add is\add* the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another. 
\v 8 For in the hand of the LORD \add there is\add* a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture, and he poureth out of the same: but the dregs of it all the wicked of the earth shall wring \add them\add* out, \add and\add* drink \add them\add* . 
\v 9 But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob. 
\v 10 All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; \add but\add* the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.

\v 1 To the chief Musician on Neginoth, A Psalm \add or\add* Song of Asaph. In Judah \add is\add* God known: his name \add is\add* great in Israel. 
\v 2 In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion. 
\v 3 There he broke the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah. 
\v 4 Thou \add art\add* more glorious \add and\add* excellent than the mountains of prey. 
\v 5 The stout-hearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and none of the men of might have found their hands. 
\v 6 At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep. 
\v 7 Thou, \add even\add* thou, \add art\add* to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry? 
\v 8 Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still, 
\v 9 When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah. 
\v 10 Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath wilt thou restrain. 
\v 11 Vow, and pay to the LORD your God: let all that are about him bring presents to him that ought to be feared. 
\v 12 He shall cut off the spirit of princes: \add he is\add* terrible to the kings of the earth.

\v 1 To the chief Musician, to Jeduthun, A Psalm of Asaph. I cried to God with my voice, \add even\add* to God with my voice; and he gave ear to me. 
\v 2 In the day of my trouble I sought the LORD: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted. 
\v 3 I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah. 
\v 4 Thou holdest my eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak. 
\v 5 I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times. 
\v 6 I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with my own heart: and my spirit made diligent search. 
\v 7 Will the LORD cast off for ever? and will he be favorable no more? 
\v 8 Is his mercy wholly gone for ever? doth \add his\add* promise fail for evermore? 
\v 9 Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah. 
\v 10 And I said, This \add is\add* my infirmity: \add but I will remember\add* the years of the right hand of the Most High. 
\v 11 I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember thy wonders of old. 
\v 12 I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings. 
\v 13 Thy way, O God, \add is\add* in the sanctuary: who \add is so\add* great a God as \add our\add* God! 
\v 14 Thou \add art\add* the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people. 
\v 15 Thou hast with \add thy\add* arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah. 
\v 16 The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were disturbed. 
\v 17 The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thy arrows also went abroad. 
\v 18 The voice of thy thunder \add was\add* in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook. 
\v 19 Thy way \add is\add* in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known. 
\v 20 Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

\v 1 Maschil of Asaph. Give ear, O my people, \add to\add* my law: incline your ear to the words of my mouth. 
\v 2 I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old: 
\v 3 Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us. 
\v 4 We will not hide \add them\add* from their children, showing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done. 
\v 5 For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children: 
\v 6 That the generation to come might know \add them\add* , \add even\add* the children \add who\add* should be born; \add who\add* should arise and declare \add them\add* to their children: 
\v 7 That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments: 
\v 8 And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation \add that\add* set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not steadfast with God. 
\v 9 The children of Ephraim, \add being\add* armed, \add and\add* carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle. 
\v 10 They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law; 
\v 11 And forgot his works, and his wonders that he had shown them. 
\v 12 Marvelous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, \add in\add* the field of Zoan. 
\v 13 He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as a heap. 
\v 14 In the day-time also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire. 
\v 15 He cleaved the rocks in the wilderness, and gave \add them\add* drink as \add out of\add* the great depths. 
\v 16 He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers. 
\v 17 And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the Most High in the wilderness. 
\v 18 And they tempted God in their heart by asking food for their desire. 
\v 19 Yes, they spoke against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness? 
\v 20 Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people? 
\v 21 Therefore the LORD heard \add this\add* , and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel; 
\v 22 Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation: 
\v 23 Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven, 
\v 24 And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven. 
\v 25 Man ate angels' food: he sent them food to the full. 
\v 26 He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind. 
\v 27 He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea: 
\v 28 And he let \add it\add* fall in the midst of their camp, around their habitations. 
\v 29 So they ate, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire; 
\v 30 They were not estranged from their desire: but while their meat \add was\add* yet in their mouths, 
\v 31 The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen \add men\add* of Israel. 
\v 32 For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works. 
\v 33 Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble. 
\v 34 When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and inquired early after God. 
\v 35 And they remembered that God \add was\add* their rock, and the high God their redeemer. 
\v 36 Nevertheless they flattered him with their mouth, and they lied to him with their tongues. 
\v 37 For their heart was not right with him, neither were they steadfast in his covenant. 
\v 38 But he, \add being\add* full of compassion, forgave \add their\add* iniquity, and destroyed \add them\add* not: yes, many a time he turned his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath. 
\v 39 For he remembered that they \add were but\add* flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again. 
\v 40 How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, \add and\add* grieve him in the desert! 
\v 41 Yes, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel. 
\v 42 They remembered not his hand, \add nor\add* the day when he delivered them from the enemy. 
\v 43 How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan: 
\v 44 And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink. 
\v 45 He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them. 
\v 46 He gave also their increase to the caterpillar, and their labor to the locust. 
\v 47 He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamore trees with frost. 
\v 48 He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts. 
\v 49 He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels \add among them\add* . 
\v 50 He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence; 
\v 51 And smote all the first-born in Egypt; the chief of \add their\add* strength in the tabernacles of Ham: 
\v 52 But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock. 
\v 53 And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies. 
\v 54 And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, \add even to\add* this mountain, \add which\add* his right hand had purchased. 
\v 55 He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. 
\v 56 Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies: 
\v 57 But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow. 
\v 58 For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images. 
\v 59 When God heard \add this\add* , he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel: 
\v 60 So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent \add which\add* he placed among men; 
\v 61 And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand. 
\v 62 He gave over his people also to the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance. 
\v 63 The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage. 
\v 64 Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation. 
\v 65 Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, \add and\add* like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine. 
\v 66 And he smote his enemies in the hinder part: he put them to a perpetual reproach. 
\v 67 Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim: 
\v 68 But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved. 
\v 69 And he built his sanctuary like high \add palaces\add* , like the earth which he hath established for ever. 
\v 70 He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheep-folds: 
\v 71 From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance. 
\v 72 So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.

\v 1 A Psalm of Asaph. O God, the heathen have come into thy inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps. 
\v 2 The dead bodies of thy servants have they given \add to be\add* food to the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints, to the beasts of the earth. 
\v 3 Their blood have they shed like water around Jerusalem; and \add there was\add* none to bury \add them\add* . 
\v 4 We have become a reproach to our neighbors, a scorn and derision to them that are around us. 
\v 5 How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy burn like fire? 
\v 6 Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name. 
\v 7 For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling-place. 
\v 8 O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender mercies speedily succor us: for we are brought very low. 
\v 9 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake. 
\v 10 Why should the heathen say, Where \add is\add* their God? let him be known among the heathen in our sight \add by\add* avenging the blood of thy servants \add which is\add* shed. 
\v 11 Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die; 
\v 12 And render to our neighbors seven-fold into their bosom their reproach, with which they have reproached thee, O LORD. 
\v 13 So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever: we will show forth thy praise to all generations.

\v 1 To the chief Musician upon Shoshannim Eduth, A Psalm of Asaph. Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest \add between\add* the cherubim, shine forth. 
\v 2 Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come \add and\add* save us. 
\v 3 Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved. 
\v 4 O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people? 
\v 5 Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears to drink in great measure. 
\v 6 Thou makest us a strife to our neighbors: and our enemies laugh among themselves. 
\v 7 Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved. 
\v 8 Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it. 
\v 9 Thou preparedst \add room\add* before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land. 
\v 10 The hills were covered with the shade of it, and its boughs \add were like\add* the goodly cedars. 
\v 11 She sent out her boughs to the sea, and her branches to the river. 
\v 12 Why hast thou \add then\add* broke down her hedges, so that all they who pass by the way do pluck her? 
\v 13 The boar from the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field doth devour it. 
\v 14 Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine; 
\v 15 And the vineyard which thy right hand planted, and the branch \add that\add* thou madest strong for thyself. 
\v 16  \add It is\add* burnt with fire, \add it is\add* cut down: they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance. 
\v 17 Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man \add whom\add* thou madest strong for thyself. 
\v 18 So will we not go back from thee: revive us, and we will call upon thy name. 
\v 19 Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.

\v 1 To the chief Musician upon Gittith, \add A Psalm\add* of Asaph. Sing aloud to God our strength: make a joyful noise to the God of Jacob. 
\v 2 Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery. 
\v 3 Blow the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day. 
\v 4 For this \add was\add* a statute for Israel, \add and\add* a law of the God of Jacob. 
\v 5 This he ordained in Joseph \add for\add* a testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt: \add where\add* I heard a language \add that\add* I understood not. 
\v 6 I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered from the pots. 
\v 7 Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah. 
\v 8 Hear, O my people, and I will testify to thee; O Israel, if thou wilt hearken to me; 
\v 9 There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god. 
\v 10 I \add am\add* the LORD thy God who brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it. 
\v 11 But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would not obey me. 
\v 12 So I gave them up to their own hearts lust: \add and\add* they walked in their own counsels. 
\v 13 O that my people had hearkened to me, \add and\add* Israel had walked in my ways! 
\v 14 I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries. 
\v 15 The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves to him: and their time should have endured for ever. 
\v 16 He would have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock I should have satisfied thee.

\v 2 For lo, thy enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head. 
\v 3 They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones. 
\v 4 They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from \add being\add* a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance. 
\v 5 For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee, 
\v 6 The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes; 
\v 7 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre; 
\v 8 Assur also is joined with them: they have helped the children of Lot. Selah. 
\v 9 Do to them as \add to\add* the Midianites; as \add to\add* Sisera, as \add to\add* Jabin, at the brook of Kison: 
\v 10  \add Who\add* perished at En-dor: they became \add as\add* dung for the earth. 
\v 11 Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yes, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna: 
\v 12 Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession. 
\v 13 O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind. 
\v 14 As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire; 
\v 15 So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm. 
\v 16 Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD. 
\v 17 Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yes, let them be put to shame, and perish:

\v 3 Thou hast taken away all thy wrath; thou hast turned \add thyself\add* from the fierceness of thy anger. 
\v 4 Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thy anger towards us to cease.

\v 3 Be merciful to me, O LORD: for I cry to thee daily.

\v 1 A Song \add or\add* Psalm for the sons of Korah, to the chief Musician upon Mahalath Leannoth, Maschil of Heman the Ezrahite. O LORD God of my salvation, I have cried day \add and\add* night before thee: 
\v 2 Let my prayer come before thee: incline thy ear to my cry; 
\v 3 For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh to the grave. 
\v 4 I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man \add that hath\add* no strength: 
\v 5 Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy hand. 
\v 6 Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps. 
\v 7 Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted \add me\add* with all thy waves. Selah. 
\v 8 Thou hast put away my acquaintance far from me; thou hast made me an abomination to them: \add I am\add* shut up, and I cannot come forth. 
\v 9 My eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD, I have called daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands to thee. 
\v 10 Wilt thou show wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise \add and\add* praise thee? Selah. 
\v 11 Shall thy loving-kindness be declared in the grave? \add or\add* thy faithfulness in destruction? 
\v 12 Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness? 
\v 13 But to thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall my prayer come before thee. 
\v 14 LORD, why castest thou off my soul? \add why\add* hidest thou thy face from me? 
\v 15 I \add am\add* afflicted and ready to die from \add my\add* youth up: \add while\add* I suffer thy terrors I am distracted. 
\v 16 Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.

\v 18 Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, \add and\add* my acquaintance into darkness.

\v 1 Maschil of Ethan the Ezrahite. I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations. 
\v 2 For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy faithfulness wilt thou establish in the very heavens. 
\v 3 I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn to David my servant, 
\v 4 Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations. Selah. 
\v 5 And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD; thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints. 
\v 6 For who in the heaven can be compared to the LORD? \add who\add* among the sons of the mighty can be likened to the LORD? 
\v 7 God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence by all \add them that are\add* about him. 
\v 8 O LORD God of hosts, who \add is\add* a strong LORD like to thee? or to thy faithfulness around thee? 
\v 9 Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when its waves arise, thou stillest them. 
\v 10 Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou hast scattered thy enemies with thy strong arm. 
\v 11 The heavens \add are\add* thine, the earth also \add is\add* thine: \add as for\add* the world, and the fullness of it, thou hast founded them. 
\v 12 The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name. 
\v 13 Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, \add and\add* high is thy right hand. 
\v 14 Justice and judgment \add are\add* the habitation of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face. 
\v 15 Blessed \add are\add* the people that know the joyful sound: they shall walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance. 
\v 16 In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted. 
\v 17 For thou \add art\add* the glory of their strength: and in thy favor our horn shall be exalted. 
\v 18 For the LORD \add is\add* our defense; and the Holy One of Israel \add is\add* our king. 
\v 19 Then thou didst speak in vision to thy holy one, and say, I have laid help upon \add one that is\add* mighty; I have exalted \add one\add* chosen out of the people. 
\v 20 I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him: 
\v 21 With whom my hand shall be established: my arm also shall strengthen him. 
\v 22 The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness afflict him. 
\v 23 And I will beat down his foes before his face, and afflict them that hate him. 
\v 24 But my faithfulness and my mercy \add shall be\add* with him: and in my name shall his horn be exalted. 
\v 25 I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers. 
\v 26 He shall cry to me, Thou \add art\add* my father, my God, and the rock of my salvation. 
\v 27 Also I will make him \add my\add* first-born, higher than the kings of the earth. 
\v 28 My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him. 
\v 29 His seed also will I make \add to endure\add* for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven. 
\v 30 If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments; 
\v 31 If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments; 
\v 32 Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes. 
\v 33 Nevertheless my loving-kindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail. 
\v 34 My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that hath gone out of my lips. 
\v 35 Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie to David. 
\v 36 His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me. 
\v 37 It shall be established for ever as the moon, and \add as\add* a faithful witness in heaven. Selah. 
\v 38 But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with thy anointed. 
\v 39 Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast profaned his crown \add by casting it\add* to the ground. 
\v 40 Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin. 
\v 41 All that pass by the way plunder him: he is a reproach to his neighbors. 
\v 42 Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice. 
\v 43 Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made him to stand in the battle. 
\v 44 Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to the ground. 
\v 45 The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered him with shame. Selah. 
\v 46 How long, LORD, wilt thou hide thyself? for ever? shall thy wrath burn like fire? 
\v 47 Remember how short my time is: why hast thou made all men in vain? 
\v 48 What man \add is he that\add* liveth, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah. 
\v 49 LORD, where \add are\add* thy former loving-kindnesses, \add which\add* thou didst swear to David in thy truth? 
\v 50 Remember, LORD, the reproach of thy servants; \add how\add* I do bear in my bosom \add the reproach of\add* all the mighty people; 
\v 51 With which thy enemies have reproached, O LORD; with which they have reproached the footsteps of thy anointed 
\v 52 Blessed \add be\add* the LORD for evermore. Amen and amen.

\v 1 A prayer of Moses the man of God. LORD, thou hast been our dwelling-place in all generations. 
\v 2 Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou \add art\add* God. 
\v 3 Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men. 
\v 4 For a thousand years in thy sight \add are but\add* as yesterday when it is past, and \add as\add* a watch in the night. 
\v 5 Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are \add as\add* a sleep; in the morning \add they are\add* like grass \add which\add* groweth. 
\v 6 In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth. 
\v 7 For we are consumed by thy anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled. 
\v 8 Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret \add sins\add* in the light of thy countenance. 
\v 9 For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our years, as a tale \add that is told\add* . 
\v 10 The days of our years \add are\add* seventy years; and if by reason of strength \add they are\add* eighty years, yet \add is\add* their strength labor and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away. 
\v 11 Who knoweth the power of thy anger? even according to thy fear, \add so is\add* thy wrath. 
\v 12 So teach \add us\add* to number \add our\add* days, that we may apply our hearts to wisdom. 
\v 13 Return, O LORD, how long? and repent thou concerning thy servants. 
\v 14 O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days. 
\v 15 Make us glad according to the days \add in which\add* thou hast afflicted us, \add and\add* the years \add in which\add* we have seen evil. 
\v 16 Let thy work appear to thy servants, and thy glory to their children. 
\v 17 And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yes, the work of our hands establish thou it. 
\c 91  
\p
\v 1 He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. 
\v 2 I will say of the LORD, \add He is\add* my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust. 
\v 3 Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, \add and\add* from the noisome pestilence. 
\v 4 He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth \add shall be thy\add* shield and buckler. 
\v 5 Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; \add nor\add* for the arrow \add that\add* flieth by day; 
\v 6  \add Nor\add* for the pestilence \add that\add* walketh in darkness; \add nor\add* for the destruction \add that\add* wasteth at noon-day. 
\v 7 A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; \add but\add* it shall not come nigh thee. 
\v 8 Only with thy eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked. 
\v 9 Because thou hast made the LORD \add who is\add* my refuge, \add even\add* the Most High, thy habitation; 
\v 10 There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling. 
\v 11 For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. 
\v 12 They shall bear thee up in \add their\add* hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone. 
\v 13 Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet. 
\v 14 Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name. 
\v 15 He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I \add will be\add* with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honor him. 
\v 16 With long life will I satisfy him, and show him my salvation.

\v 1 A Psalm \add or\add* Song for the sabbath day. \add It is a\add* good \add thing\add* to give thanks to the LORD, and to sing praises to thy name, O Most High. 
\v 2 To show forth thy loving-kindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night. 
\v 3 Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn sound. 
\v 4 For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands. 
\v 5 O LORD, how great are thy works! \add and\add* thy thoughts are very deep. 
\v 6 A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this. 
\v 7 When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; \add it is\add* that they shall be destroyed for ever: 
\v 8 But thou, LORD, \add art most\add* high for evermore. 
\v 9 For lo, thy enemies, O LORD, for lo, thy enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered. 
\v 10 But my horn shalt thou exalt like \add the horn of\add* an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil. 
\v 11 My eye also shall see \add my desire\add* on my enemies, \add and\add* my ears shall hear \add my desire\add* of the wicked that rise up against me. 
\v 12 The righteous shall flourish like the palm-tree; he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon. 
\v 13 Those that are planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the courts of our God. 
\v 14 They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing; 
\v 15 To show that the LORD \add is\add* upright: \add he is\add* my rock, and \add there is\add* no unrighteousness in him. 
\c 93  
\p
\v 1 The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is clothed with strength, \add with which\add* he hath girded himself: the world also is established, that it cannot be moved. 
\v 2 Thy throne \add is\add* established of old: thou \add art\add* from everlasting. 
\v 3 The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift their waves. 
\v 4 The LORD on high \add is\add* mightier than the noise of many waters, \add yes\add* , \add than\add* the mighty waves of the sea. 
\v 5 Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thy house, O LORD, for ever. 
\c 94  
\p
\v 1 O LORD God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom vengeance belongeth, show thyself. 
\v 2 Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to the proud. 
\v 3 LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph? 
\v 4  \add How long\add* shall they utter \add and\add* speak hard things? \add and\add* all the workers of iniquity boast themselves? 
\v 5 They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thy heritage. 
\v 6 They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless. 
\v 7 Yet they say, The LORD will not see, neither will the God of Jacob regard \add it\add* . 
\v 8 Understand, ye brutish among the people: and \add ye\add* fools, when will ye be wise? 
\v 9 He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see? 
\v 10 He that chastiseth the heathen, shall he not correct? he that teacheth man knowledge, \add shall he not know\add* ? 
\v 11 The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they \add are\add* vanity. 
\v 12 Blessed \add is\add* the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest him out of thy law; 
\v 13 That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the wicked. 
\v 14 For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance. 
\v 15 But judgment shall return to righteousness: and all the upright in heart shall follow it. 
\v 16 Who will rise up for me against the evil-doers? \add or\add* who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity? 
\v 17 Unless the LORD \add had been\add* my help, my soul had almost dwelt in silence. 
\v 18 When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up. 
\v 19 In the multitude of my thoughts within me, thy comforts delight my soul. 
\v 20 Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by a law? 
\v 21 They assemble themselves against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood. 
\v 22 But the LORD is my defense; and my God \add is\add* the rock of my refuge. 
\v 23 And he will bring upon them their own iniquity, and will cut them off in their own wickedness; \add yes\add* , the LORD our God will cut them off.

\v 1 O come, let us sing to the LORD: let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation. 
\v 2 Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise to him with psalms. 
\v 3 For the LORD \add is\add* a great God, and a great King above all gods. 
\v 4 In his hand \add are\add* the deep places of the earth: the strength of the hills \add is\add* his also. 
\v 5 The sea \add is\add* his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry \add land\add* . 
\v 6 O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the LORD our maker. 
\v 7 For he \add is\add* our God; and we \add are\add* the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. To-day, if ye will hear his voice, 
\v 8 Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, \add and\add* as \add in\add* the day of temptation in the wilderness: 
\v 9 When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work. 
\v 10 Forty years long was I grieved with \add this\add* generation, and said, It \add is\add* a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways: 
\v 11 To whom I swore in my wrath, that they should not enter into my rest. 
\c 96

\v 1 O sing to the LORD a new song: sing to the LORD, all the earth. 
\v 2 Sing to the LORD, bless his name; show forth his salvation from day to day. 
\v 3 Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all people. 
\v 4 For the LORD \add is\add* great, and greatly to be praised: he \add is\add* to be feared above all gods. 
\v 5 For all the gods of the nations \add are\add* idols: but the LORD made the heavens. 
\v 6 Honor and majesty \add are\add* before him: strength and beauty \add are\add* in his sanctuary. 
\v 7 Give to the LORD, O ye kindreds of the people, give to the LORD glory and strength. 
\v 8 Give to the LORD the glory \add due to\add* his name: bring an offering, and come into his courts. 
\v 9 O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth. 
\v 10 Say among the heathen \add that\add* the LORD reigneth: the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he will judge the people righteously. 
\v 11 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fullness of it. 
\v 12 Let the field be joyful, and all that \add is\add* in it: then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice before the LORD: 
\v 13 For he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: he will judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth. 
\c 97  
\p
\v 1 The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad. 
\v 2 Clouds and darkness surround him: righteousness and judgment \add are\add* the habitation of his throne. 
\v 3 A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about. 
\v 4 His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and trembled. 
\v 5 The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the presence of the LORD of the whole earth. 
\v 6 The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see his glory. 
\v 7 Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols; worship him, all \add ye\add* gods. 
\v 8 Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of thy judgments, O LORD. 
\v 9 For thou, LORD, \add art\add* high above all the earth: thou art exalted far above all gods. 
\v 10 Ye that love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked. 
\v 11 Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart. 
\v 12 Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.

\p
\v 1 A Psalm. O sing to the LORD a new song; for he hath done marvelous things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory. 
\v 2 The LORD hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath he openly shown in the sight of the heathen. 
\v 3 He hath remembered his mercy and his truth towards the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God. 
\v 4 Make a joyful noise to the LORD, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise. 
\v 5 Sing to the LORD with the harp; with the harp, and the voice of a psalm. 
\v 6 With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the LORD, the King. 
\v 7 Let the sea roar, and the fullness of it, the world, and they that dwell therein. 
\v 8 Let the floods clap \add their\add* hands: let the hills be joyful together 
\v 9 Before the LORD; for he cometh to judge the earth: with righteousness will he judge the world, and the people with equity. 
\c 99  
\p
\v 1 The LORD reigneth; let the people tremble: he setteth \add between\add* the cherubim; let the earth be moved. 
\v 2 The LORD \add is\add* great in Zion; and he \add is\add* high above all people. 
\v 3 Let them praise thy great and terrible name; \add for\add* it \add is\add* holy. 
\v 4 The king's strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob. 
\v 5 Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool; \add for\add* he \add is\add* holy. 
\v 6 Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered them. 
\v 7 He spoke to them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his testimonies, and the ordinance \add that\add* he gave them. 
\v 8 Thou didst answer them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God that forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions. 
\v 9 Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the LORD our God \add is\add* holy.

\v 1 A Psalm of praise. Make a joyful noise to the LORD, all ye lands. 
\v 2 Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with singing. 
\v 3 Know ye that the LORD he \add is\add* God: \add it is\add* he \add that\add* hath made us, and not we ourselves; \add we are\add* his people, and the sheep of his pasture. 
\v 4 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, \add and\add* into his courts with praise: be thankful to him, \add and\add* bless his name.

\v 1 A Psalm of David. I will sing of mercy and judgment: to thee, O LORD, will I sing. 
\v 2 I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou come to me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart. 
\v 3 I will set no wicked thing before my eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me. 
\v 4 A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked \add person\add* . 
\v 5 Whoever privily slandereth his neighbor, him will I cut off: him that hath a high look and a proud heart I will not suffer. 
\v 6 My eyes \add shall be\add* upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me. 
\v 7 He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight. 
\v 8 I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut off all who practice wickedness from the city of the LORD.

\p
\v 1 A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, and poureth out his complaint before the LORD. Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come to thee. 
\v 2 Hide not thy face from me in the day \add when\add* I am in trouble; incline thy ear to me: in the day \add when\add* I call, answer me speedily. 
\v 3 For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth. 
\v 4 My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget to eat my bread. 
\v 5 By reason of the voice of my groaning, my bones cleave to my skin. 
\v 6 I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert. 
\v 7 I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top. 
\v 8 My enemies reproach me all the day; \add and\add* they that are enraged against me are sworn against me. 
\v 9 For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping, 
\v 10 Because of thy indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down. 
\v 11 My days \add are\add* like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered like grass. 
\v 12 But thou, O LORD, shalt endure for ever; and thy remembrance to all generations. 
\v 13 Thou shalt arise, \add and\add* have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favor her, yes, the set time, is come. 
\v 14 For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favor the dust thereof. 
\v 15 So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD: and all the kings of the earth thy glory. 
\v 16 When the LORD shall build up Zion, he will appear in his glory. 
\v 17 He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer. 
\v 18 This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD. 
\v 19 For he hath looked down from the hight of his sanctuary; from heaven hath the LORD beheld the earth; 
\v 20 To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death; 
\v 21 To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem; 
\v 22 When the people are assembled, and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD. 
\v 23 He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days. 
\v 24 I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years \add are\add* throughout all generations. 
\v 25 Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens \add are\add* the work of thy hands. 
\v 26 They shall perish, but thou wilt endure: yes, all of them shall grow old like a garment; as a vesture wilt thou change them, and they shall be changed: 
\v 27 But thou \add art\add* the same, and thy years will have no end. 
\v 28 The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee. 
\c 103  
\p
\v 1  \add A Psalm\add* of David. Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, \add bless\add* his holy name. 
\v 2 Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits: 
\v 3 Who forgiveth all thy iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases; 
\v 4 Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with loving-kindness and tender mercies; 
\v 5 Who satisfieth thy mouth with good \add things\add* ; \add so that\add* thy youth is renewed like the eagle's. 
\v 6 The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed. 
\v 7 He made known his ways to Moses, his acts to the children of Israel. 
\v 8 The LORD \add is\add* merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in mercy. 
\v 9 He will not always chide: neither will he keep \add his anger\add* for ever. 
\v 10 He hath not dealt with us according to our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities. 
\v 11 For as the heaven is high above the earth, \add so\add* great is his mercy towards them that fear him. 
\v 12 As far as the east is from the west, \add so\add* far hath he removed our transgressions from us. 
\v 13 Like as a father pitieth \add his\add* children, \add so\add* the LORD pitieth them that fear him. 
\v 14 For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we \add are\add* dust. 
\v 15  \add As for\add* man, his days \add are\add* as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth. 
\v 16 For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and its place shall know it no more. 
\v 17 But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness to children's children; 
\v 18 To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them. 
\v 19 The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all. 
\v 20 Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening to the voice of his word. 
\v 21 Bless ye the LORD, all \add ye\add* his hosts; \add ye\add* ministers of his, that do his pleasure. 
\v 22 Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the LORD, O my soul. 
\c 104  
\p
\v 1 Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honor and majesty. 
\v 2 Who coverest \add thyself\add* with light as \add with\add* a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain: 
\v 3 Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind: 
\v 4 Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire: 
\v 5  \add Who\add* laid the foundations of the earth, \add that\add* it should not be removed for ever. 
\v 6 Thou coveredst it with the deep as \add with\add* a garment: the waters stood above the mountains. 
\v 7 At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away. 
\v 8 They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys to the place which thou hast founded for them. 
\v 9 Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth. 
\v 10 He sendeth the springs into the valleys, \add which\add* run among the hills. 
\v 11 They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst. 
\v 12 By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, \add which\add* sing among the branches. 
\v 13 He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works. 
\v 14 He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth; 
\v 15 And wine \add that\add* maketh glad the heart of man, \add and\add* oil to make \add his\add* face to shine, and bread \add which\add* strengtheneth man's heart. 
\v 16 The trees of the LORD are full \add of sap\add* ; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted; 
\v 17 Where the birds make their nests: \add as for\add* the stork, the fir-trees \add are\add* her house. 
\v 18 The high hills \add are\add* a refuge for the wild goats; \add and\add* the rocks for the conies. 
\v 19 He appointeth the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down. 
\v 20 Thou makest darkness, and it is night: in which all the beasts of the forest do creep \add forth\add* . 
\v 21 The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their food from God. 
\v 22 The sun ariseth, they collect, and lay themselves down in their dens. 
\v 23 Man goeth forth to his work and to his labor until the evening. 
\v 24 O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches. 
\v 25  \add So is\add* this great and wide sea, in which \add are\add* creeping animals innumerable, both small and great beasts. 
\v 26 There go the ships: \add there is\add* that leviathan, \add which\add* thou hast made to play therein. 
\v 27 These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give \add them\add* their food in due season. 
\v 28  \add That which\add* thou givest them, they gather: thou openest thy hand, they are filled with good. 
\v 29 Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust. 
\v 30 Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth. 
\v 31 The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in his works. 
\v 32 He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke. 
\v 33 I will sing to the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being. 
\v 34 My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the LORD. 
\v 35 Let sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD.

\v 1 O give thanks to the LORD; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people. 
\v 2 Sing to him, sing psalms to him: talk ye of all his wondrous works. 
\v 3 Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD. 
\v 4 Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore. 
\v 5 Remember his wonderful works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth; 
\v 6 O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen. 
\v 7 He \add is\add* the LORD our God: his judgments \add are\add* in all the earth. 
\v 8 He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word \add which\add* he commanded to a thousand generations. 
\v 9 Which \add covenant\add* he made with Abraham, and his oath to Isaac; 
\v 10 And confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, \add and\add* to Israel \add for\add* an everlasting covenant: 
\v 11 Saying, To thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance: 
\v 12 When they were a few men in number; yes, very few, and strangers in it. 
\v 13 When they went from one nation to another, from \add one\add* kingdom to another people; 
\v 14 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yes, he reproved kings for their sakes; 
\v 15  \add Saying\add* , Touch not my anointed, and do my prophets no harm. 
\v 16 Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he broke the whole staff of bread. 
\v 17 He sent a man before them, \add even\add* Joseph, \add who\add* was sold for a servant: 
\v 18 Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron: 
\v 19 Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him. 
\v 20 The king sent and loosed him; \add even\add* the ruler of the people, and let him go free. 
\v 21 He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance: 
\v 22 To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom. 
\v 23 Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham. 
\v 24 And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies. 
\v 25 He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants. 
\v 26 He sent Moses his servant; \add and\add* Aaron whom he had chosen. 
\v 27 They showed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham. 
\v 28 He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word. 
\v 29 He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish. 
\v 30 Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings. 
\v 31 He spoke, and there came divers sorts of flies, \add and\add* lice in all their borders. 
\v 32 He gave them hail for rain, \add and\add* flaming fire in their land. 
\v 33 He smote their vines also and their fig-trees; and broke the trees of their borders. 
\v 34 He spoke, and the locusts came, and caterpillars, and that without number, 
\v 35 And ate up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground. 
\v 36 He smote also all the first-born in their land, the chief of all their strength. 
\v 37 He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and \add there was\add* not one feeble \add person\add* among their tribes. 
\v 38 Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them. 
\v 39 He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night. 
\v 40  \add The people\add* asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven. 
\v 41 He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places \add like\add* a river. 
\v 42 For he remembered his holy promise, \add and\add* Abraham his servant. 
\v 43 And he brought forth his people with joy, \add and\add* his chosen with gladness: 
\v 44 And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labor of the people; 
\v 45 That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the LORD. 
\c 106  
\p
\v 1 Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks to the LORD; for \add he is\add* good: for his mercy \add endureth\add* for ever. 
\v 2 Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? \add who\add* can show forth all his praise? 
\v 3 Blessed \add are\add* they that keep judgment, \add and\add* he that doeth righteousness at all times. 
\v 4 Remember me, O LORD, with the favor \add that thou bearest to\add* thy people: O visit me with thy salvation; 
\v 5 That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thy inheritance. 
\v 6 We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly. 
\v 7 Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked \add him\add* at the sea, \add even\add* at the Red sea. 
\v 8 Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known. 
\v 9 He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness. 
\v 10 And he saved them from the hand of him that hated \add them\add* , and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. 
\v 11 And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left. 
\v 12 Then they believed his words; they sang his praise. 
\v 13 They soon forgot his works; they waited not for his counsel: 
\v 14 But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert. 
\v 15 And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul. 
\v 16 They envied Moses also in the camp, \add and\add* Aaron the saint of the LORD. 
\v 17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram. 
\v 18 And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked. 
\v 19 They made a calf in Horeb, and worshiped the molten image. 
\v 20 Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass. 
\v 21 They forgot God their savior, who had done great things in Egypt; 
\v 22 Wondrous works in the land of Ham, \add and\add* terrible things by the Red sea. 
\v 23 Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy \add them\add* . 
\v 24 Yes, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word: 
\v 25 But murmured in their tents, \add and\add* hearkened not to the voice of the LORD. 
\v 26 Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness: 
\v 27 To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands. 
\v 28 They joined themselves also to Baal-peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead. 
\v 29 Thus they provoked \add him\add* to anger with their inventions: and the plague broke in upon them. 
\v 30 Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and \add so\add* the plague was stayed. 
\v 31 And that was counted to him for righteousness to all generations for ever. 
\v 32 They angered \add him\add* also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes: 
\v 33 Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spoke unadvisedly with his lips. 
\v 34 They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them: 
\v 35 But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works. 
\v 36 And they served their idols: which were a snare to them. 
\v 37 Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons, 
\v 38 And shed innocent blood, \add even\add* the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood. 
\v 39 Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went astray with their own inventions. 
\v 40 Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance. 
\v 41 And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them. 
\v 42 Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand. 
\v 43 Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked \add him\add* with their counsel; and were brought low for their iniquity. 
\v 44 Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry: 
\v 45 And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies. 
\v 46 He made them also to be pitied by all those that carried them captives. 
\v 47 Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks to thy holy name, \add and\add* to triumph in thy praise. 
\v 48 Blessed \add be\add* the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD.

\v 1 O give thanks to the LORD, for \add he is\add* good; for his mercy \add endureth\add* for ever. 
\v 2 Let the redeemed of the LORD say \add so\add* , whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy; 
\v 3 And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south. 
\v 4 They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in. 
\v 5 Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them. 
\v 6 Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, \add and\add* he delivered them out of their distresses. 
\v 7 And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation. 
\v 8 Oh that \add men\add* would praise the LORD \add for\add* his goodness, and \add for\add* his wonderful works to the children of men! 
\v 9 For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness. 
\v 10 Such as sit in darkness and in the shades of death, \add being\add* bound in affliction and iron; 
\v 11 Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the Most High: 
\v 12 Therefore he brought down their heart with labor; they fell down, and \add there was\add* none to help. 
\v 13 Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, \add and\add* he saved them out of their distresses. 
\v 14 He brought them out of darkness and the shades of death, and broke their bands asunder. 
\v 15 Oh that \add men\add* would praise the LORD \add for\add* his goodness, and \add for\add* his wonderful works to the children of men! 
\v 16 For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron asunder. 
\v 17 Fools, because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted. 
\v 18 Their soul abhorreth all manner of food; and they draw near to the gates of death. 
\v 19 Then they cry to the LORD in their trouble, he saveth them out of their distresses. 
\v 20 He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered \add them\add* from their destructions. 
\v 21 Oh that \add men\add* would praise the LORD \add for\add* his goodness, and \add for\add* his wonderful works to the children of men! 
\v 22 And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing. 
\v 23 They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business on great waters; 
\v 24 These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep. 
\v 25 For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up its waves. 
\v 26 They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble. 
\v 27 They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit's end. 
\v 28 Then they cry to the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses. 
\v 29 He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves \add of the sea\add* are still. 
\v 30 Then are they glad because they are quiet; so he bringeth them to their desired haven. 
\v 31 Oh that \add men\add* would praise the LORD \add for\add* his goodness, and \add for\add* his wonderful works to the children of men! 
\v 32 Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders. 
\v 33 He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the water-springs into dry ground; 
\v 34 A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell in it. 
\v 35 He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into water-springs. 
\v 36 And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation; 
\v 37 And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase. 
\v 38 He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease. 
\v 39 Again, they are diminished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow. 
\v 40 He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, \add where there is\add* no way. 
\v 41 Yet he setteth the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him families like a flock. 
\v 42 The righteous shall see \add it\add* , and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth. 
\v 43 Whoever \add is\add* wise, and will observe these \add things\add* , even they shall understand the loving-kindness of the LORD.

\v 1 To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise; 
\v 2 For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue. 
\v 3 They encompassed me also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause. 
\v 4 For my love they are my adversaries: but I \add give myself to\add* prayer. 
\v 5 And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love. 
\v 6 Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand. 
\v 7 When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin. 
\v 8 Let his days be few; \add and\add* let another take his office. 
\v 9 Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow. 
\v 10 Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek \add their bread\add* also out of their desolate places. 
\v 11 Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let strangers spoil his labor. 
\v 12 Let there be none to extend mercy to him: neither let there be any to favor his fatherless children. 
\v 13 Let his posterity be cut off; \add and\add* in the generation following let their name be blotted out. 
\v 14 Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out. 
\v 15 Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth. 
\v 16 Because that he remembered not to show mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart. 
\v 17 As he loved cursing, so let it come to him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him. 
\v 18 As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones. 
\v 19 Let it be to him as the garment \add which\add* covereth him, and for a girdle with which he is girded continually. 
\v 20  \add Let\add* this \add be\add* the reward of my adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul. 
\v 21 But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name's sake: because thy mercy \add is\add* good, deliver thou me. 
\v 22 For I \add am\add* poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me. 
\v 23 I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust. 
\v 24 My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness. 
\v 25 I became also a reproach to them: \add when\add* they looked upon me they shook their heads. 
\v 26 Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy: 
\v 27 That they may know that this \add is\add* thy hand; \add that\add* thou, LORD, hast done it. 
\v 28 Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice. 
\v 29 Let my adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle. 
\v 30 I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yes, I will praise him among the multitude. 
\v 31 For he will stand at the right hand of the poor, to save \add him\add* from those that condemn his soul.

\v 16 The heaven, \add even\add* the heavens, \add are\add* the LORD'S: but the earth hath he given to the children of men. 
\v 17 The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence. 
\v 18 But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for ever. Praise the LORD.

\v 1 I love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice \add and\add* my supplications. 
\v 2 Because he hath inclined his ear to me, therefore will I call upon \add him\add* as long as I live. 
\v 3 The sorrows of death encompassed me, and the pains of hell came upon me: I found trouble and sorrow. 
\v 4 Then I called upon the name of the LORD; O LORD, I beseech thee, deliver my soul. 
\v 5 Gracious \add is\add* the LORD, and righteous; yes, our God \add is\add* merciful. 
\v 6 The LORD preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helped me. 
\v 7 Return to thy rest, O my soul; for the LORD hath dealt bountifully with thee. 
\v 8 For thou hast delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, \add and\add* my feet from falling. 
\v 9 I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living. 
\v 10 I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted: 
\v 11 I said in my haste, All men \add are\add* liars. 
\v 12 What shall I render to the LORD \add for\add* all his benefits towards me? 
\v 13 I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the LORD. 
\v 14 I will pay my vows to the LORD now in the presence of all his people. 
\v 15 Precious in the sight of the LORD \add is\add* the death of his saints. 
\v 16 O LORD, truly I \add am\add* thy servant; I \add am\add* thy servant, the son of thy handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds. 
\v 17 I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the LORD. 
\v 18 I will pay my vows to the LORD now in the presence of all his people, 
\v 19 In the courts of the LORD'S house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.

\v 3 Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy \add endureth\add* for ever. 
\v 4 Let them now that fear the LORD say, that his mercy \add endureth\add* for ever. 
\v 5 I called upon the LORD in distress: the LORD answered me, \add and set me\add* in a large place. 
\v 6 The LORD \add is\add* on my side; I will not fear: what can man do to me? 
\v 7 The LORD taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see \add my desire\add* upon them that hate me. 
\v 8  \add It is\add* better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man. 
\v 9  \add It is\add* better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in princes. 
\v 10 All nations encompassed me: but in the name of the LORD will I destroy them. 
\v 11 They encompassed me; yes, they encompassed me: but in the name of the LORD I will destroy them. 
\v 12 They encompassed me like bees; they are quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will destroy them. 
\v 13 Thou hast violently thrust at me that I might fall: but the LORD helped me. 
\v 14 The LORD \add is\add* my strength and song, and is become my salvation. 
\v 15 The voice of rejoicing and salvation \add is\add* in the tabernacles of the righteous: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly. 
\v 16 The right hand of the LORD is exalted: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly. 
\v 17 I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD. 
\v 18 The LORD hath chastened me severely: but he hath not given me over to death. 
\v 19 Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will enter them, \add and\add* I will praise the LORD: 
\v 20 This gate of the LORD, into which the righteous shall enter. 
\v 21 I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation. 
\v 22 The stone \add which\add* the builders refused is become the head \add stone\add* of the corner. 
\v 23 This is the LORD'S doing; it \add is\add* wonderful in our eyes.

\v 27 God \add is\add* the LORD, who hath shown us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, \add even\add* to the horns of the altar. 
\v 28 Thou \add art\add* my God, and I will praise thee: \add thou art\add* my God, I will exalt thee.

\v 9 BETH. Wherewith shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed \add to it\add* , according to thy word. 
\v 10 With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander from thy commandments. 
\v 11 Thy word have I hid in my heart, that I might not sin against thee. 
\v 12 Blessed \add art\add* thou, O LORD: teach me thy statutes. 
\v 13 With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth.

\v 43 And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I have hoped in thy judgments. 
\v 44 So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever. 
\v 45 And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts. 
\v 46 I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will not be ashamed. 
\v 47 And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have loved. 
\v 48 My hands also will I lift to thy commandments, which I have loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes. 
\v 49 ZAIN. Remember the word to thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope. 
\v 50 This \add is\add* my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath revived me. 
\v 51 The proud have had me greatly in derision: \add yet\add* I have not declined from thy law. 
\v 52 I remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD; and have comforted myself. 
\v 53 Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy law. 
\v 54 Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage. 
\v 55 I have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have kept thy law. 
\v 56 This I had, because I kept thy precepts.

\v 59 I thought on my ways, and turned my feet to thy testimonies. 
\v 60 I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments. 
\v 61 The bands of the wicked have robbed me: \add but\add* I have not forgotten thy law. 
\v 62 At midnight I will rise to give thanks to thee, because of thy righteous judgments. 
\v 63 I \add am\add* a companion of all \add them\add* that fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts.

\v 67 Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy word. 
\v 68 Thou \add art\add* good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes. 
\v 69 The proud have forged a lie against me: \add but\add* I will keep thy precepts with \add my\add* whole heart. 
\v 70 Their heart is as gross as fat; \add but\add* I delight in thy law.

\v 87 They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy precepts.

\v 3 Jerusalem is built as a city that is compact together: 
\v 4 Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, to the testimony of Israel, to give thanks to the name of the LORD. 
\v 5 For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David. 
\v 6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee.

\v 3 Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us; for we are exceedingly filled with contempt. 
\v 4 Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease, \add and\add* with the contempt of the proud.

\v 2 If \add it had not been\add* the LORD who was on our side, when men rose up against us: 
\v 3 Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us: 
\v 4 Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul: 
\v 5 Then the proud waters had gone over our soul. 
\v 6 Blessed \add be\add* the LORD, who hath not given us \add as\add* a prey to their teeth. 
\v 7 Our soul hath escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare \add is\add* broken, and we have escaped.

\v 2 Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done great things for them. 
\v 3 The LORD hath done great things for us; \add of which\add* we are glad. 
\v 4 Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south.

\v 2  \add It is\add* vain for you to rise early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: \add for\add* so he giveth his beloved sleep. 
\v 3 Lo, children \add are\add* a heritage of the LORD: \add and\add* the fruit of the womb \add is his\add* reward. 
\v 4 As arrows \add are\add* in the hand of a mighty man: so \add are\add* children of the youth.

\v 1 A Song of degrees. Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say: 
\v 2 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they have not prevailed against me. 
\v 3 The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows. 
\v 4 The LORD \add is\add* righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked. 
\v 5 Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion. 
\v 6 Let them be as the grass \add upon\add* the house-tops, which withereth before it groweth up:

\v 4 But \add there is\add* forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared. 
\v 5 I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope. 
\v 6 My soul \add waiteth\add* for the LORD more than they that watch for the morning: \add I say\add* , \add more than\add* they that watch for the morning.

\v 1 A Song of degrees. LORD, remember David \add and\add* all his afflictions; 
\v 2 How he swore to the LORD, \add and\add* vowed to the mighty \add God\add* of Jacob; 
\v 3 Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed; 
\v 4 I will not give sleep to my eyes, \add or\add* slumber to my eyelids, 
\v 5 Until I find a place for the LORD, a habitation for the mighty \add God\add* of Jacob. 
\v 6 Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood. 
\v 7 We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool. 
\v 8 Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength. 
\v 9 Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy saints shout for joy. 
\v 10 For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thy anointed. 
\v 11 The LORD hath sworn \add in\add* truth to David; he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne. 
\v 12 If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them; their children also shall sit upon thy throne for ever. 
\v 13 For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired \add it\add* for his habitation. 
\v 14 This \add is\add* my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it. 
\v 15 I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread. 
\v 16 I will also clothe her priests with salvation, and her saints shall shout aloud for joy. 
\v 17 There will I make the horn of David to bud, I have ordained a lamp for my anointed. 
\v 18 His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his crown flourish.

\v 1 A Song of degrees of David. Behold, how good and how pleasant \add it is\add* for brethren to dwell together in unity! 
\v 2  \add It is\add* like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, \add even\add* Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of his garment;

\v 6 Whatever the LORD pleased, \add that\add* did he in heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places. 
\v 7 He causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries. 
\v 8 Who smote the first-born of Egypt, both of man and beast. 
\v 9  \add Who\add* sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants. 
\v 10 Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings; 
\v 11 Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan: 
\v 12 And gave their land \add for\add* a heritage, a heritage to Israel his people. 
\v 13 Thy name, O LORD, \add endureth\add* for ever; \add and\add* thy memorial, O LORD, throughout all generations. 
\v 14 For the LORD will judge his people, and he will repent concerning his servants.

\v 1 By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yes, we wept, when we remembered Zion.

\v 4 How shall we sing the LORD'S song in a foreign land? 
\v 5 If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget \add her skill\add* . 
\v 6 If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy. 
\v 7 Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Raze \add it\add* , raze \add it\add* , \add even\add* to its foundation. 
\v 8 O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy \add shall he be\add* , that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.

\v 3 In the day when I cried thou didst answer me, \add and\add* strengthen me \add with\add* strength in my soul. 
\v 4 All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD, when they hear the words of thy mouth.

\v 6 Though the LORD \add is\add* high, yet hath he respect to the lowly: but the proud he knoweth afar off.

\v 1 To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. O LORD, thou hast searched me, and known \add me\add* . 
\v 2 Thou knowest my down-sitting and my up rising, thou understandest my thought afar off. 
\v 3 Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted \add with\add* all my ways. 
\v 4 For \add there is\add* not a word on my tongue, \add but\add* lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether. 
\v 5 Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thy hand upon me. 
\v 6  \add Such\add* knowledge \add is\add* too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot \add attain\add* to it. 
\v 7 Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence? 
\v 8 If I ascend into heaven, thou \add art\add* there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou \add art there\add* . 
\v 9  \add If\add* I take the wings of the morning, \add and\add* dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea; 
\v 10 Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me. 
\v 11 If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me. 
\v 12 Yes, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light \add are\add* both alike \add to thee\add* . 
\v 13 For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb. 
\v 14 I will praise thee: for I am fearfully \add and\add* wonderfully made: wonderful \add are\add* thy works; and \add that\add* my soul well knoweth. 
\v 15 My substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret, \add and\add* curiously formed in the lowest parts of the earth. 
\v 16 Thy eyes saw my substance, yet being imperfect; and in thy book all \add my members\add* were written, \add which\add* in continuance were fashioned, when \add as yet there was\add* none of them. 
\v 17 How precious also are thy thoughts to me, O God! how great is the sum of them! 
\v 18  \add If\add* I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee. 
\v 19 Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men. 
\v 20 For they speak against thee wickedly, \add and\add* thy enemies take \add thy name\add* in vain. 
\v 21 Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee? 
\v 22 I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them my enemies.

\v 3 They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adder's poison \add is\add* under their lips. Selah. 
\v 4 Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my goings. 
\v 5 The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the way side: they have set gins for me. Selah. 
\v 6 I said to the LORD, Thou \add art\add* my God: hear the voice of my supplications, O LORD. 
\v 7 O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered my head in the day of battle.

\v 1 Maschil of David; a prayer when he was in the cave. I cried to the LORD with my voice; with my voice to the LORD I made my supplication. 
\v 2 I poured out my complaint before him; I showed before him my trouble. 
\v 3 When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path. In the way in which I walked have they privily laid a snare for me. 
\v 4 I looked on \add my\add* right hand, and beheld, but \add there was\add* no man that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul. 
\v 5 I cried to thee, O LORD: I said, Thou \add art\add* my refuge \add and\add* my portion in the land of the living. 
\v 6 Attend to my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I. 
\v 7 Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the righteous shall encompass me; for thou wilt deal bountifully with me.

\v 1 A Psalm of David. Hear my prayer, O LORD, give ear to my supplications: in thy faithfulness answer me, \add and\add* in thy righteousness. 
\v 2 And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man living be justified. 
\v 3 For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead. 
\v 4 Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me is desolate. 
\v 5 I remember the days of old, I meditate on all thy works; I muse on the work of thy hands. 
\v 6 I stretch forth my hands to thee: my soul \add thirsteth\add* after thee, as a thirsty land. Selah. 
\v 7 Hear me speedily, O LORD: my spirit faileth: hide not thy face from me, lest I be like them that go down into the pit. 
\v 8 Cause me to hear thy loving-kindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way in which I should walk; for I lift up my soul to thee. 
\v 9 Deliver me, O LORD, from my enemies: I flee to thee to hide me. 
\v 10 Teach me to do thy will; for thou \add art\add* my God: thy spirit \add is\add* good; lead me into the land of uprightness. 
\v 11 Revive me, O LORD, for thy name's sake: for thy righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble.

\v 10 He delighteth not in the strength of the horse: he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man. 
\v 11 The LORD taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in his mercy. 
\v 12 Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion. 
\v 13 For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed thy children within thee. 
\v 14 He maketh peace \add in\add* thy borders, \add and\add* filleth thee with the finest of the wheat. 
\v 15 He sendeth forth his commandment \add upon\add* earth: his word runneth very swiftly. 
\v 16 He giveth snow like wool: he scattereth the hoar-frost like ashes. 
\v 17 He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before his cold? 
\v 18 He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind to blow, \add and\add* the waters flow. 
\v 19 He showeth his word to Jacob, his statutes and his judgments to Israel. 
\v 20 He hath not dealt so with any nation: and \add as for his\add* judgments, they have not known them. Praise ye the LORD.
