\v 1 The elder to the well-beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth. 
\v 2 Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth. 
\v 3 For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth. 
\v 4 I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth. 
\v 5 Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers; 
\v 6 Who have borne testimony of thy charity before the church: whom if thou shalt bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou wilt do well: 
\v 7 Because for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing from the Gentiles. 
\v 8 We therefore ought to receive such, that we may be fellow-helpers to the truth. 
\v 9 I wrote to the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the pre-eminence among them, receiveth us not. 
\v 10 Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content with that, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth \add them\add* out of the church. 
\v 11 Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God. 
\v 12 Demetrius hath good report by all \add men\add* , and by the truth itself: and we \add also\add* bear testimony; and ye know that our testimony is true. 
\v 13 I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write to thee: 
\v 14 But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace \add be\add* to thee. \add Our\add* friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name.
