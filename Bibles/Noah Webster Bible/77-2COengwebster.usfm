\mt1 THE SECOND EPISTLE OF PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE CORINTHIANS 
\c 1  
\p
\v 1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy \add our\add* brother, to the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints who are in all Achaia: 
\v 2 Grace \add be\add* to you and peace from God our Father, and \add from\add* the Lord Jesus Christ. 
\v 3 Blessed \add be\add* God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all consolation. 
\v 4 Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them who are in any trouble by the consolation with which we ourselves are comforted by God. 
\v 5 For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ. 
\v 6 And whether we are afflicted, \add it is\add* for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we are comforted, \add it is\add* for your consolation and salvation. 
\v 7 And our hope of you \add is\add* steadfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so \add shall ye be\add* also of the consolation. 
\v 8 For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, so that we despaired even of life: 
\v 9 But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raiseth the dead: 
\v 10 Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver \add us\add* : 
\v 11 Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift \add bestowed\add* upon us by the means of many persons, thanks may be given by many on our behalf. 
\v 12 For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our manner of life in the world, and more abundantly toward you. 
\v 13 For we write no other things to you, than what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye will acknowledge even to the end; 
\v 14 As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also \add are\add* ours in the day of the Lord Jesus. 
\v 15 And in this confidence I purposed to come to you before, that ye might have a second benefit; 
\v 16 And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again from Macedonia to you, and by you to be brought on my way towards Judea. 
\v 17 When I therefore was thus minded, did I use levity? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea, yea, and nay, nay? 
\v 18 But \add as\add* God \add is\add* true, our word towards you was not yea and nay. 
\v 19 For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, \add even\add* by me, and Silvanus, and Timothy, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea. 
\v 20 For all the promises of God in him \add are\add* yea, and in him Amen, to the glory of God by us. 
\v 21 Now he who establisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, \add is\add* God; 
\v 22 Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the spirit in our hearts. 
\v 23 Moreover, I call God for a witness upon my soul, that to spare you I have not as yet come to Corinth. 
\v 24 Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness. 
\v 2 For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same who is made sorry by me? 
\v 3 And I wrote this same to you, lest, coming I should have sorrow from them by whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is \add the joy\add* of you all. 
\v 4 For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly to you. 
\v 5 But if any hath caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all. 
\v 6 Sufficient to such a man \add is\add* this punishment, which \add was inflicted\add* by many. 
\v 7 So that on the other hand, ye \add ought\add* rather to forgive \add him\add* , and comfort \add him\add* , lest perhaps such one should be swallowed up with excessive sorrow. 
\v 8 Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm \add your\add* love towards him. 
\v 9 For to this end also I wrote, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye are obedient in all things. 
\v 10 To whom ye forgive any thing, I \add forgive\add* also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave \add it\add* , for your sakes \add I forgave it\add* , in the person of Christ; 
\v 11 Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices. 
\v 12 Furthermore, when I came to Troas to \add preach\add* the gospel of Christ, and a door was opened to me by the Lord, 
\v 13 I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother; but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia. 
\v 14 Now thanks \add be\add* to God, who always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savor of his knowledge by us in every place. 
\v 15 For we are to God a sweet savor of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish: 
\v 16 To the one \add we are\add* the savor of death to death; and to the other the savor of life to life. And who \add is\add* sufficient for these things? 
\v 17 For we are not as many, who corrupt the word of God: but as from sincerity, but as from God, in the sight of God we speak in Christ. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some \add others\add* , epistles of commendation to you, or \add letters\add* of commendation from you. 
\v 2 Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read by all men: 
\v 3  \add Forasmuch as ye are\add* manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not on tables of stone, but on fleshly tables of the heart. 
\v 4 And such trust we have through Christ toward God. 
\v 5 Not that we are sufficient by ourselves to think any thing as from ourselves; but our sufficiency \add is\add* from God; 
\v 6 Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life. 
\v 7 But if the ministration of death, written \add and\add* engraven on stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which \add glory\add* was to be done away; 
\v 8 How shall not the ministration of the Spirit be rather glorious? 
\v 9 For if the ministration of condemnation \add was\add* glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory. 
\v 10 For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth. 
\v 11 For if that which was done away \add was\add* glorious, much more that which remaineth \add is\add* glorious. 
\v 12 Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech: 
\v 13 And not as Moses, \add who\add* put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished: 
\v 14 But their minds were blinded: for until this day the same vail remaineth untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which \add vail\add* is done away in Christ. 
\v 15 But even to this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart. 
\v 16 Nevertheless, when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away. 
\v 17 Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord \add is\add* , there \add is\add* liberty. 
\v 18 But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, \add even\add* as by the Spirit of the Lord. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 Therefore, seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not; 
\v 2 But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty; not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but, by manifestation of the truth, commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God. 
\v 3 But if our gospel is hid, it is hid to them that are lost: 
\v 4 In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them who believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine to them. 
\v 5 For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake. 
\v 6 For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined into our hearts, to \add give\add* the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. 
\v 7 But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God, and not from us. 
\v 8  \add We are\add* troubled on every side, yet not distressed; \add we are\add* perplexed, but not in despair; 
\v 9 Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed; 
\v 10 Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our body. 
\v 11 For we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our mortal flesh. 
\v 12 So then death worketh in us, but life in you. 
\v 13 We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak; 
\v 14 Knowing, that he who raised the Lord Jesus, will raise us also by Jesus, and will present \add us\add* with you. 
\v 15 For all things \add are\add* for your sakes, that the abundant grace may, through the thanksgiving of many, redound to the glory of God. 
\v 16 For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man is wasted, yet the inward \add man\add* is renewed day by day. 
\v 17 For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh out for us a far more exceeding \add and\add* eternal weight of glory; 
\v 18 While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen \add are\add* temporal; but the things which are not seen \add are\add* eternal. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 For we know that if our earthly house of \add this\add* tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. 
\v 2 For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed with our house which is from heaven: 
\v 3 If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked. 
\v 4 For we that are in \add this\add* tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not because we would be unclothed, but clothed, that mortality might be swallowed up in life. 
\v 5 Now he that hath wrought us for this same thing \add is\add* God, who also hath given to us the earnest of the Spirit. 
\v 6 Therefore \add we are\add* always confident, knowing that, while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord: 
\v 7 (For we walk by faith, not by sight:) 
\v 8 We are confident, \add I say\add* , and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord. 
\v 9 Wherefore we labor, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted by him. 
\v 10 For we must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things \add done\add* in \add his\add* body, according to what he hath done, whether good or bad. 
\v 11 Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest to God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences. 
\v 12 For we commend not ourselves again to you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to \add answer\add* them who glory in appearance, and not in heart. 
\v 13 For whether we are beside ourselves, \add it is\add* to God: or whether we are sober, \add it is\add* for your cause. 
\v 14 For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: 
\v 15 And \add that\add* he died for all, that they who live should not henceforth live to themselves, but to him who died for them, and rose again. 
\v 16 Wherefore henceforth we know no man according to the flesh: though indeed we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now henceforth we know \add him\add* no more. 
\v 17 Therefore, if any man \add is\add* in Christ, \add he is\add* a new creature: old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new. 
\v 18 And all things \add are\add* from God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation; 
\v 19 To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not imputing their trespasses to them; and hath committed to us the word of reconciliation. 
\v 20 Now then we are embassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech \add you\add* by us: we pray \add you\add* in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God. 
\v 21 For he hath made him \add to be\add* sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1 We then, \add as\add* co-workers \add with him\add* , beseech \add you\add* also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain. 
\v 2 (For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succored thee: behold, now \add is\add* the accepted time; behold, now \add is\add* the day of salvation.) 
\v 3 Giving no offense in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed: 
\v 4 But in all \add things\add* approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses, 
\v 5 In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in fastings; 
\v 6 By pureness, by knowledge, by long-suffering, by kindness, by the Holy Spirit, by love unfeigned, 
\v 7 By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, 
\v 8 By honor and dishonor, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and \add yet\add* true; 
\v 9 As unknown, and \add yet\add* well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed; 
\v 10 As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and \add yet\add* possessing all things. 
\v 11 O \add ye\add* Corinthians, our mouth is open to you, our heart is enlarged. 
\v 12 Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels. 
\v 13 Now for a recompense in the same (I speak as to \add my\add* children,) be ye also enlarged. 
\v 14 Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness? 
\v 15 And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? 
\v 16 And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in \add them\add* ; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. 
\v 17 Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean \add thing\add* ; and I will receive you; 
\v 18 And \add I\add* will be a Father to you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1 Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God. 
\v 2 Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man. 
\v 3 I speak not \add this\add* to condemn \add you\add* : for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die and live with \add you\add* . 
\v 4 Great \add is\add* my boldness of speech towards you, great \add is\add* my glorying concerning you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation. 
\v 5 For, when we had come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without \add were\add* fightings, within \add were\add* fears. 
\v 6 Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus; 
\v 7 And not by his coming only, but by the consolation with which he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind towards me; so that I rejoiced the more. 
\v 8 For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though \add it was\add* but for a season. 
\v 9 Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing. 
\v 10 For godly sorrow worketh penitence to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death. 
\v 11 For behold this very thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, \add what\add* clearing of yourselves, yea, \add what\add* indignation, yea, \add what\add* fear, yea, \add what\add* vehement desire, yea, \add what\add* zeal, yea, \add what\add* avenging! In all \add things\add* ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter. 
\v 12 Wherefore, though I wrote to you, \add I did it\add* not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear to you. 
\v 13 Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: and exceedingly the more we rejoiced for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all. 
\v 14 For if I have boasted any thing to him concerning you, I am not ashamed; but as we spoke all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which \add I made\add* before Titus, is found a truth. 
\v 15 And his tender affection is more abundant towards you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him. 
\v 16 I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all \add things\add* . 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1 Moreover, brethren, we make known to you the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia; 
\v 2 That in a great trial of affliction, the abundance of their joy, and their deep poverty, abounded to the riches of their liberality. 
\v 3 For to \add their\add* power, I bear testimony, and even beyond \add their\add* power, \add they were\add* willing of themselves; 
\v 4 Praying us with much entreaty, that we would receive the gift, and \add take upon us\add* the fellowship of the ministering to the saints. 
\v 5 And \add this they did\add* , not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and to us by the will of God: 
\v 6 So that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also. 
\v 7 Therefore, as ye abound in every \add thing\add* , \add in\add* faith and utterance, and knowledge, and \add in\add* all diligence, and \add in\add* your love to us, \add see\add* that ye abound in this grace also. 
\v 8 I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love. 
\v 9 For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich. 
\v 10 And in this I give \add my\add* advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago. 
\v 11 Now therefore finish the doing \add of it\add* ; that as \add there was\add* a readiness to will, so \add there may be\add* a performance also out of that which ye have. 
\v 12 For if there is first a willing mind, \add it is\add* accepted according to what a man hath, \add and\add* not according to what he hath not. 
\v 13 For \add I mean\add* not that other men should be eased, and you burdened: 
\v 14 But by an equality, \add that\add* now at this time your abundance \add may be a supply\add* for their want, that their abundance also may be \add a supply\add* for your want: that there may be equality: 
\v 15 As it is written, He that \add had gathered\add* much had nothing over; and he that \add had gathered\add* little had no want. 
\v 16 But thanks \add be\add* to God, who put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you. 
\v 17 For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went to you. 
\v 18 And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise \add is\add* in the gospel throughout all the churches; 
\v 19 And not \add that\add* only, but who was also chosen by the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and \add declaration of\add* your ready mind: 
\v 20 Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us: 
\v 21 Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men. 
\v 22 And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have often proved \add to be\add* diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which \add I have\add* in you. 
\v 23 If \add any inquire\add* concerning Titus, \add he is\add* my partner and fellow-helper concerning you: or our brethren \add be inquired of\add* , \add they are\add* the messengers of the churches, \add and\add* the glory of Christ. 
\v 24 Wherefore show ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 For as concerning the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you: 
\v 2 For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath incited very many. 
\v 3 Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready: 
\v 4 Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting. 
\v 5 Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before to you, and make up before hand your bounty, of which ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as \add a matter of\add* bounty, and not \add of\add* covetousness. 
\v 6 But this \add I say\add* , He who soweth sparingly, shall reap also sparingly; and he who soweth bountifully, shall reap also bountifully. 
\v 7 Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, \add so let him give\add* ; not grudgingly, or by constraint: for God loveth a cheerful giver. 
\v 8 And God \add is\add* able to make all grace abound towards you; that ye always having all sufficiency in all \add things\add* , may abound to every good work: 
\v 9 (As it is written, He hath dispersed; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever. 
\v 10 Now may he that ministereth seed to the sower, both minister bread for \add your\add* food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;) 
\v 11 Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God. 
\v 12 For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings to God; 
\v 13 While by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection to the gospel of Christ, and for \add your\add* liberal distribution to them, and to all \add men\add* ; 
\v 14 And by their prayer for you, who long after you, for the exceeding grace of God in you. 
\v 15 Thanks \add be\add* to God for his unspeakable gift. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1 Now I Paul myself beseech you, by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence \add am\add* base among you, but being absent am bold towards you: 
\v 2 But I beseech \add you\add* , that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, with which I think to be bold against some, who think of us as if we walked according to the flesh. 
\v 3 For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh: 
\v 4 (For the weapons of our warfare \add are\add* not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;) 
\v 5 Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ; 
\v 6 And having in a readiness to avenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled. 
\v 7 Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trusteth to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think this again, that, as he \add is\add* Christ's, even so \add are\add* we Christ's. 
\v 8 For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed: 
\v 9 That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters. 
\v 10 For \add his\add* letters (say they) \add are\add* weighty and powerful; but \add his\add* bodily presence \add is\add* weak, and \add his\add* speech contemptible. 
\v 11 Let such one think this, that such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such \add will we be\add* also in deed when we are present. 
\v 12 For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise. 
\v 13 But we will not boast of things without \add our\add* measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even to you. 
\v 14 For we stretch not ourselves beyond \add our measure\add* , as though we reached not to you; for we are come as far as to you also in \add preaching\add* the gospel of Christ: 
\v 15 Not boasting of things without \add our\add* measure, \add that is\add* , of other men's labors; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you, according to our rule abundantly, 
\v 16 To preach the gospel in the \add regions\add* beyond you, \add and\add* not to boast in another man's line of things made ready to our hand. 
\v 17 But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. 
\v 18 For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 I earnestly wish ye could bear with me a little in \add my\add* folly: and indeed bear with me. 
\v 2 For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present \add you as\add* a chaste virgin to Christ. 
\v 3 But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ. 
\v 4 For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or \add if\add* ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with \add him\add* . 
\v 5 For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very greatest apostles. 
\v 6 But though \add I am\add* rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been thoroughly made manifest among you in all things. 
\v 7 Have I committed an offense in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God without reward? 
\v 8 I robbed other churches, taking wages \add of them\add* , to do you service. 
\v 9 And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren who came from Macedonia supplied: and in all \add things\add* I have kept myself from being burdensome to you, and \add so\add* will I keep \add myself\add* . 
\v 10 As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia. 
\v 11 Why? because I love you not? God knoweth. 
\v 12 But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them who desire occasion; that in what they glory, they may be found even as we. 
\v 13 For such \add are\add* false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. 
\v 14 And no wonder; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. 
\v 15 Therefore \add it is\add* no great thing if his ministers also are transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works. 
\v 16 I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little. 
\v 17 That which I speak, I speak \add it\add* not according to the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting. 
\v 18 Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also. 
\v 19 For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye \add yourselves\add* are wise. 
\v 20 For ye suffer, if a man bringeth you into bondage, if a man devoureth \add you\add* , if a man taketh \add from you\add* , if a man exalteth himself, if a man smiteth you on the face. 
\v 21 I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. But in whatever respect any is bold, (I speak foolishly) I am bold also. 
\v 22 Are they Hebrews? so \add am\add* I. Are they Israelites? so \add am\add* I. Are they the offspring of Abraham? so \add am\add* I. 
\v 23 Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I \add am\add* more; in labors more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths often. 
\v 24 From the Jews five times I received forty \add stripes\add* save one. 
\v 25 Thrice was I beaten with rods, once I was stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep; 
\v 26  \add In\add* journeyings often, \add in\add* perils of waters, \add in\add* perils of robbers, \add in\add* perils by \add my own\add* countrymen, \add in\add* perils by the heathen, \add in\add* perils in the city, \add in\add* perils in the wilderness, \add in\add* perils in the sea, \add in\add* perils among false brethren; 
\v 27 In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness. 
\v 28 Besides those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches. 
\v 29 Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is made to fall into sin, and I burn not? 
\v 30 If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern my infirmities. 
\v 31 The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not. 
\v 32 In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me: 
\v 33 And through a window in a basket I was let down by the wall, and escaped his hands. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord. 
\v 2 I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such one caught up to the third heaven. 
\v 3 And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) 
\v 4 That he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter. 
\v 5 Of such one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in my infirmities. 
\v 6 For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but \add now\add* I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me \add to be\add* , or \add what\add* he heareth from me. 
\v 7 And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure. 
\v 8 For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. 
\v 9 And he said to me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. 
\v 10 Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong. 
\v 11 I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended by you: for in nothing am I behind the very greatest apostles, though I am nothing. 
\v 12 Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds. 
\v 13 For what is that in which ye were inferior to other churches, except that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong. 
\v 14 Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours, but you. For the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children. 
\v 15 And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I am loved. 
\v 16 But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile. 
\v 17 Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent to you? 
\v 18 I desired Titus, and with \add him\add* I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? \add walked we\add* not in the same steps? 
\v 19 Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves to you? we speak before God in Christ: but \add we do\add* all things, dearly beloved, for your edification. 
\v 20 For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and \add that\add* I shall be found by you such as ye would not: lest \add there be\add* debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults: 
\v 21  \add And\add* lest, when I come again, my God may humble me among you, and I shall bewail many who have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness, and lewdness, and lasciviousness, which they have committed. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 This \add is\add* the third \add time\add* I am coming to you: By the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established. 
\v 2 I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them who heretofore have sinned, and to all others, that, if I come again, I will not spare; 
\v 3 Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, who toward you is not weak, but is mighty in you. 
\v 4 For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God towards you. 
\v 5 Examine yourselves, whether ye are in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye are reprobates? 
\v 6 But I trust that ye will know that we are not reprobates. 
\v 7 Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we should be as reprobates. 
\v 8 For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth. 
\v 9 For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we wish, \add even\add* your perfection. 
\v 10 Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction. 
\v 11 Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you. 
\v 12 Greet one another with a holy kiss. 
\v 13 All the saints salute you. 
\v 14 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit, \add be\add* with you all. Amen.
