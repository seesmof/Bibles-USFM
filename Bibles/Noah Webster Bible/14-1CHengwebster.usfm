\v 9 And eastward he inhabited to the entrance of the wilderness from the river Euphrates: because their cattle were multiplied in the land of Gilead. 
\v 10 And in the days of Saul they made war with the Hagarites, who fell by their hand: and they dwelt in their tents throughout all the east \add land\add* of Gilead. 
\v 11 And the children of Gad dwelt over against them, in the land of Bashan to Salcah:

\v 19 And they made war with the Hagarites, with Jetur, and Nephish, and Nodab. 
\v 20 And they were helped against them, and the Hagarites were delivered into their hand, and all that \add were\add* with them: for they cried to God in the battle, and he was entreated by them; because they put their trust in him. 
\v 21 And they took away their cattle; of their camels fifty thousand, and of sheep two hundred and fifty thousand, and of asses two thousand, and of men a hundred thousand. 
\v 22 For there fell down many slain, because the war \add was\add* of God. And they dwelt in their steads until the captivity. 
\v 23 And the children of the half tribe of Manasseh dwelt in the land: they increased from Bashan to Baal-hermon and Senir, and to mount Hermon. 
\v 24 And these \add were\add* the heads of the house of their fathers, even Epher, and Ishi, and Eliel, and Azriel, and Jeremiah, and Hodaviah, and Jahdiel, mighty men of valor, famous men, \add and\add* heads of the house of their fathers. 
\v 25 And they transgressed against the God of their fathers, and went astray after the gods of the people of the land, whom God destroyed before them. 
\v 26 And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria, and he carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, and brought them to Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and to the river Gozan, to this day.

\p
\v 1 Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa. 
\v 2 And the Philistines followed hard after Saul, and after his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul. 
\v 3 And the battle prevailed against Saul, and the archers hit him, and he was wounded by the archers. 
\v 4 Then said Saul to his armor-bearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armor-bearer would not; for he was greatly afraid. So Saul took a sword, and fell upon it. 
\v 5 And when his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise on the sword, and died. 
\v 6 So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house died together. 
\v 7 And when all the men of Israel that \add were\add* in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, then they forsook their cities, and fled: and the Philistines came and dwelt in them. 
\v 8 And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa. 
\v 9 And when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines around, to carry tidings to their idols, and to the people. 
\v 10 And they put his armor in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon. 
\v 11 And when all Jabesh-gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul, 
\v 12 They arose, all the valiant men, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days. 
\v 13 So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against the LORD, \add even\add* against the word of the LORD, which he kept not, and also for asking \add counsel\add* of \add one that had\add* a familiar spirit, to inquire \add of it\add* ; 
\v 14 And inquired not of the LORD: therefore he slew him, and turned the kingdom to David the son of Jesse. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 Then all Israel gathered themselves to David to Hebron, saying, Behold, we \add are\add* thy bone and thy flesh. 
\v 2 And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou \add wast\add* he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD thy God said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel. 
\v 3 Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD by Samuel. 
\v 4 And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which \add is\add* Jebus; where the Jebusites \add were\add* , the inhabitants of the land. 
\v 5 And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come hither. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which \add is\add* the city of David. 
\v 6 And David said, Whoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, and was chief. 
\v 7 And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it, The city of David. 
\v 8 And he built the city around, even from Millo around: and Joab repaired the rest of the city. 
\v 9 So David became greater and greater: for the LORD of hosts \add was\add* with him. 
\v 10 These also \add are\add* the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, \add and\add* with all Israel, to make him king according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel. 
\v 11 And this \add is\add* the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam a Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted his spear against three hundred slain \add by him\add* at one time. 
\v 12 And after him \add was\add* Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who \add was one\add* of the three mighties. 
\v 13 He was with David at Pas-dammim, and there the Philistines were gathered to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines. 
\v 14 And they set themselves in the midst of \add that\add* parcel, and delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved \add them\add* by a great deliverance. 
\v 15 Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim. 
\v 16 And David \add was\add* then in the hold, and the Philistines' garrison \add was\add* then at Beth-lehem. 
\v 17 And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Beth-lehem, that \add is\add* at the gate! 
\v 18 And the three broke through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that \add was\add* by the gate, and took \add it\add* , and brought \add it\add* to David: but David would not drink \add of\add* it, but poured it out to the LORD, 
\v 19 And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with \add the jeopardy of\add* their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mightiest. 
\v 20 And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for lifting his spear against three hundred, he slew \add them\add* , and had a name among the three. 
\v 21 Of the three, he was more honorable than the two; for he was their captain: but he attained not to the \add first\add* three. 
\v 22 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lion-like men of Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day. 
\v 23 And he slew an Egyptian, a man of \add great\add* stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian's hand \add was\add* a spear like a weaver's beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear. 
\v 24 These \add things\add* did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among the three mighties. 
\v 25 Behold, he was honorable among the thirty, but attained not to the \add first\add* three: and David set him over his guard. 
\v 26 Also the valiant men of the armies \add were\add* , Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Beth-lehem, 
\v 27 Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite, 
\v 28 Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Antothite, 
\v 29 Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite, 
\v 30 Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite, 
\v 31 Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah, \add that pertained\add* to the children of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite, 
\v 32 Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite, 
\v 33 Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite, 
\v 34 The sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shage the Hararite, 
\v 35 Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphel the son of Ur, 
\v 36 Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite, 
\v 37 Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai, 
\v 38 Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Haggeri, 
\v 39 Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite, the armor-bearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah, 
\v 40 Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite, 
\v 41 Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai, 
\v 42 Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a captain of the Reubenites, and thirty with him, 
\v 43 Hanan the son of Maachah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite, 
\v 44 Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jehiel the sons of Hothan the Aroerite, 
\v 45 Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite, 
\v 46 Eliel the Mehavite, and Jeribai, and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite, 
\v 47 Eliel, and Obed, and Jasiel the Mesobaite. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 Now these \add are\add* they that came to David to Ziklag, while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish: and they \add were\add* among the mighty men, helpers of the war. 
\v 2  \add They were\add* armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in \add hurling\add* stones, and \add shooting\add* arrows from a bow, \add even\add* of Saul's brethren of Benjamin. 
\v 3 The chief \add was\add* Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; and Berachah, and Jehu the Antothite, 
\v 4 And Ismaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and over the thirty; and Jeremiah, and Jahaziel, and Johanan, and Josabad the Gederathite, 
\v 5 Eluzai, and Jerimoth, and Bealiah, and Shemariah, and Shephatiah the Haruphite, 
\v 6 Elkanah, and Jesiah, and Azareel, and Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korhites. 
\v 7 And Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor. 
\v 8 And of the Gadites there separated themselves to David in the hold in the wilderness men of might, \add and\add* men of war \add fit\add* for the battle, that could handle shield and buckler, whose faces \add were like\add* the faces of lions, and \add were\add* as swift as the roes upon the mountains; 
\v 9 Ezer the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third, 
\v 10 Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth, 
\v 11 Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh, 
\v 12 Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth, 
\v 13 Jeremiah the tenth, Machbanai the eleventh. 
\v 14 These \add were\add* of the sons of Gad, captains of the host: one of the least \add was\add* over a hundred, and the greatest over a thousand. 
\v 15 These \add are\add* they that went over Jordan in the first month, when it had overflowed all its banks; and they put to flight all \add them\add* of the valleys, \add both\add* towards the east, and towards the west. 
\v 16 And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the hold to David. 
\v 17 And David went out to meet them, and answered and said to them, If ye have come peaceably to me to help me, my heart shall be knit to you: but if \add ye have come\add* to betray me to my enemies, seeing \add there is\add* no wrong in my hands, the God of our fathers look \add on it\add* , and rebuke \add it\add* . 
\v 18 Then the spirit came upon Amasai, \add who was\add* chief of the captains, \add and he said\add* , Thine \add are we\add* , David, and on thy side, thou son of Jesse: peace, peace \add be\add* to thee, and peace \add be\add* to thy helpers; for thy God helpeth thee. Then David received them, and made them captains of the band. 
\v 19 And there fell \add some\add* of Manasseh to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them not: for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away, saying, He will fall to his master Saul to \add the jeopardy of\add* our heads. 
\v 20 And as he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zilthai, captains of the thousands that \add were\add* of Manasseh. 
\v 21 And they helped David against the band \add of the rovers\add* : for they \add were\add* all mighty men of valor, and were captains in the host. 
\v 22 For at \add that\add* time day by day there came to David to help him, until \add it was\add* a great host, like the host of God. 
\v 23 And these \add are\add* the numbers of the bands \add that were\add* ready armed to the war, \add and\add* came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of the LORD. 
\v 24 The children of Judah that bore shield and spear \add were\add* six thousand and eight hundred, ready armed for war. 
\v 25 Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valor for war, seven thousand and one hundred. 
\v 26 Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred. 
\v 27 And Jehoiada \add was\add* the leader of the Aaronites, and with him \add were\add* three thousand and seven hundred; 
\v 28 And Zadok, a young man mighty of valor, and of his father's house twenty and two captains. 
\v 29 And of the children of Benjamin, the kindred of Saul, three thousand: for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept the ward of the house of Saul. 
\v 30 And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred, mighty men of valor, famous throughout the house of their fathers. 
\v 31 And of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, who were expressed by name, to come and make David king. 
\v 32 And of the children of Issachar, \add who were men\add* that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do; the heads of them \add were\add* two hundred; and all their brethren \add were\add* at their command. 
\v 33 Of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, with all instruments of war, fifty thousand, who could keep rank: \add they were\add* not of double heart. 
\v 34 And of Naphtali a thousand captains, and with them with shield and spear thirty and seven thousand. 
\v 35 And of the Danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand and six hundred. 
\v 36 And of Asher, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, forty thousand. 
\v 37 And on the other side of Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and of the half tribe of Manasseh, with all manner of instruments of war for the battle, a hundred and twenty thousand. 
\v 38 All these men of war, that could keep rank, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel: and all the rest also of Israel \add were\add* of one heart to make David king. 
\v 39 And there they were with David three days, eating and drinking: for their brethren had prepared for them. 
\v 40 Moreover, they that were nigh them, \add even\add* to Issachar, and Zebulun, and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, \add and\add* provision, meal, cakes of figs, and bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep abundantly: for \add there was\add* joy in Israel. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 And David consulted with the captains of thousands, and of hundreds, \add and\add* with every leader. 
\v 2 And David said to all the congregation of Israel, If \add it seemeth\add* good to you, and \add that it is\add* of the LORD our God, let us send abroad to our brethren every where, \add that are\add* left in all the land of Israel, and with them \add also\add* to the priests and Levites \add who are\add* in their cities \add and\add* suburbs, that they may assemble to us: 
\v 3 And let us bring again to us the ark of our God: for we inquired not at it in the days of Saul. 
\v 4 And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people. 
\v 5 So David assembled all Israel, from Shihor of Egypt even to the entrance of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjath-jearim. 
\v 6 And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, \add that is\add* , to Kirjath-jearim, which \add belonged\add* to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the LORD, that dwelleth \add between\add* the cherubim, whose name is called \add on it\add* . 
\v 7 And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart. 
\v 8 And David and all Israel played before God with all \add their\add* might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets. 
\v 9 And when they came to the threshing-floor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled. 
\v 10 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God. 
\v 11 And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perez-uzza to this day. 
\v 12 And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God \add home\add* to me? 
\v 13 So David brought not the ark to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite. 
\v 14 And the ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in his house three months. And the LORD blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that he had. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1 Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him a house. 
\v 2 And David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over Israel, for his kingdom was exalted on high, because of his people Israel. 
\v 3 And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and daughters. 
\v 4 Now these \add are\add* the names of \add his\add* children which he had in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon, 
\v 5 And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet, 
\v 6 And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia, 
\v 7 And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet. 
\v 8 And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard \add of it\add* , and went out against them. 
\v 9 And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. 
\v 10 And David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into my hand? And the LORD said to him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thy hand. 
\v 11 So they came up to Baal-perazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon my enemies by my hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim. 
\v 12 And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire. 
\v 13 And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley. 
\v 14 Therefore David inquired again of God: and God said to him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees. 
\v 15 And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees, then thou shalt go out to battle: for God hath gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines. 
\v 16 David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer. 
\v 17 And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1 And \add David\add* made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent. 
\v 2 Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath the LORD chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister to him for ever. 
\v 3 And David assembled all Israel to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the LORD to its place, which he had prepared for it. 
\v 4 And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites: 
\v 5 Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren a hundred and twenty: 
\v 6 Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty: 
\v 7 Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief, and his brethren a hundred and thirty: 
\v 8 Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred: 
\v 9 Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren eighty: 
\v 10 Of the sons of Uzziel: Amminadab the chief, and his brethren a hundred and twelve. 
\v 11 And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab, 
\v 12 And said to them, Ye \add are\add* the chief of the fathers of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, \add both\add* ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel to \add the place that\add* I have prepared for it. 
\v 13 For because ye \add did it\add* not at the first, the LORD our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order. 
\v 14 So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel. 
\v 15 And the children of the Levites bore the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staffs on it, as Moses commanded, according to the word of the LORD. 
\v 16 And David spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren \add to be\add* the singers with instruments of music, psalteries, and harps, and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy. 
\v 17 So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah; 
\v 18 And with them their brethren of the second \add degree\add* , Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, the porters. 
\v 19 So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, \add were appointed\add* to sound with cymbals of brass; 
\v 20 And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth; 
\v 21 And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel. 
\v 22 And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, \add was\add* for song: he instructed about the song, because he \add was\add* skillful. 
\v 23 And Berechiah and Elkanah \add were\add* door-keepers for the ark. 
\v 24 And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obed-edom and Jehiah \add were\add* door-keepers for the ark. 
\v 25 So David and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD from the house of Obed-edom with joy. 
\v 26 And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams. 
\v 27 And David \add was\add* clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bore the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also \add had\add* upon him an ephod of linen. 
\v 28 Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps. 
\v 29 And it came to pass, \add as\add* the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul, looking out at a window, saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart. 
\c 16  
\p
\v 1 So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt-sacrifices and peace-offerings before God. 
\v 2 And when David had made an end of offering the burnt-offerings and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD. 
\v 3 And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon \add of wine\add* . 
\v 4 And he appointed \add certain\add* of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the LORD God of Israel: 
\v 5 Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals; 
\v 6 Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God. 
\v 7 Then on that day David delivered first \add this psalm\add* to thank the LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren. 
\v 8 Give thanks to the LORD, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people. 
\v 9 Sing to him, sing psalms to him, talk ye of all his wonderous works. 
\v 10 Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD. 
\v 11 Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually. 
\v 12 Remember his wonderful works that he hath done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth; 
\v 13 O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones. 
\v 14 He \add is\add* the LORD our God; his judgments \add are\add* in all the earth. 
\v 15 Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word \add which\add* he commanded to a thousand generations; 
\v 16  \add Even of the covenant\add* which he made with Abraham, and of his oath to Isaac; 
\v 17 And which he confirmed to Jacob for a law, \add and\add* to Israel \add for\add* an everlasting covenant, 
\v 18 Saying, To thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance; 
\v 19 When ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it. 
\v 20 And \add when\add* they went from nation to nation, and from \add one\add* kingdom to another people; 
\v 21 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes, 
\v 22  \add Saying\add* , Touch not my anointed, and do my prophets no harm. 
\v 23 Sing to the LORD, all the earth; show forth from day to day his salvation. 
\v 24 Declare his glory among the heathen; his wonderful works among all nations. 
\v 25 For great \add is\add* the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also \add is\add* to be feared above all gods. 
\v 26 For all the gods of the people \add are\add* idols: but the LORD made the heavens. 
\v 27 Glory and honor \add are\add* in his presence; strength and gladness \add are\add* in his place. 
\v 28 Give to the LORD, ye kindreds of the people, give to the LORD glory and strength. 
\v 29 Give to the LORD the glory \add due\add* to his name: bring an offering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness. 
\v 30 Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved. 
\v 31 Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let \add men\add* say among the nations, The LORD reigneth. 
\v 32 Let the sea roar, and the fullness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all that \add is\add* therein. 
\v 33 Then shall the trees of the wood sing at the presence of the LORD, because he cometh to judge the earth. 
\v 34 O give thanks to the LORD; for \add he is\add* good; for his mercy \add endureth\add* for ever. 
\v 35 And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, \add and\add* glory in thy praise. 
\v 36 Blessed \add be\add* the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the LORD. 
\v 37 So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required: 
\v 38 And Obed-edom with their brethren, sixty and eight; Obed-edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah \add to be\add* porters: 
\v 39 And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that \add was\add* at Gibeon, 
\v 40 To offer burnt-offerings to the LORD upon the altar of the burnt-offering continually morning and evening, and \add to do\add* according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which he commanded Israel; 
\v 41 And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the LORD, because his mercy \add endureth\add* for ever; 
\v 42 And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun \add were\add* porters. 
\v 43 And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house. 
\c 17  
\p
\v 1 Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in a house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the LORD \add remaineth\add* under curtains. 
\v 2 Then Nathan said to David, Do all that \add is\add* in thy heart; for God \add is\add* with thee. 
\v 3 And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying, 
\v 4 Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in: 
\v 5 For I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel to this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from \add one\add* tabernacle \add to another\add* . 
\v 6 Wherever I have walked with all Israel, have I spoken a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me a house of cedars? 
\v 7 Now therefore thus shalt thou say to my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheep-cote, \add even\add* from following the sheep, that thou shouldst be ruler over my people Israel: 
\v 8 And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thy enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that \add are\add* in the earth. 
\v 9 Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning. 
\v 10 And since the time that I commanded judges \add to be\add* over my people Israel. Moreover, I will subdue all thy enemies. Furthermore, I tell thee that the LORD will build thee a house. 
\v 11 And it shall come to pass, when thy days shall be ended that thou must go \add to be\add* with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, who shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom. 
\v 12 He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne for ever. 
\v 13 I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took \add it\add* from \add him\add* that was before thee: 
\v 14 But I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore. 
\v 15 According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to David. 
\v 16 And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who \add am\add* I, O LORD God, and what \add is\add* my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto? 
\v 17 And \add yet\add* this was a small thing in thy eyes, O God; for thou hast \add also\add* spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD God. 
\v 18 What can David \add speak\add* more to thee for the honor of thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant. 
\v 19 O LORD, for thy servant's sake, and according to thy own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all \add these\add* great things. 
\v 20 O LORD, \add there\add* is none like thee, neither \add is there any\add* God besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears. 
\v 21 And what one nation in the earth \add is\add* like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem \add to be\add* his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt? 
\v 22 For thy people Israel didst thou make thy own people for ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God. 
\v 23 Therefore now, LORD, Let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said. 
\v 24 Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts \add is\add* the God of Israel, \add even\add* a God to Israel: and \add let\add* the house of David thy servant \add be\add* established before thee. 
\v 25 For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him a house: therefore thy servant hath found \add in his heart\add* to pray before thee. 
\v 26 And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness to thy servant: 
\v 27 Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest, O LORD, and \add it shall be\add* blessed for ever. 
\c 18  
\p
\v 1 Now after this it came to pass that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and its towns out of the hand of the Philistines. 
\v 2 And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David's servants, \add and\add* brought gifts. 
\v 3 And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah to Hamath, as he went to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates. 
\v 4 And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also houghed all the chariot -\add horses\add* , but reserved of them a hundred chariots. 
\v 5 And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men. 
\v 6 Then David put \add garrisons\add* in Syria-damascus; and the Syrians became David's servants, \add and\add* brought gifts. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went. 
\v 7 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. 
\v 8 Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, David brought very much brass, with which Solomon made the brazen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass. 
\v 9 Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah; 
\v 10 He sent Hadoram his son to king David to inquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had warred with Tou;) and \add with him\add* all manner of vessels of gold, and silver, and brass. 
\v 11 Them also king David dedicated to the LORD, with the silver and the gold that he brought from all \add these\add* nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek. 
\v 12 Moreover, Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand. 
\v 13 And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David's servants. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went. 
\v 14 So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all his people. 
\v 15 And Joab the son of Zeruiah \add was\add* over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, recorder; 
\v 16 And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, \add were\add* the priests; and Shavsha was scribe; 
\v 17 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada \add was\add* over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David \add were\add* chief about the king. 
\c 19  
\p
\v 1 Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead. 
\v 2 And David said, I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me. And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him. 
\v 3 But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honor thy father, that he hath sent comforters to thee? are not his servants come to thee to search, and to overthrow, and to explore the land? 
\v 4 Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them away. 
\v 5 Then there went \add certain\add* , and told David how the men were served. And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards are grown, and \add then\add* return. 
\v 6 And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syria-maachah, and out of Zobah. 
\v 7 So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people, who came and encamped before Medeba. And the children of Ammon assembled from their cities, and came to battle. 
\v 8 And when David heard \add of it\add* , he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men. 
\v 9 And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array before the gate of the city: and the kings that had come \add were\add* by themselves in the field. 
\v 10 Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he selected all the choice of Israel, and put \add them\add* in array against the Syrians. 
\v 11 And the rest of the people he delivered to the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set \add themselves\add* in array against the children of Ammon. 
\v 12 And he said, If the Syrians shall be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon shall be too strong for thee, then I will help thee. 
\v 13 Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the LORD do \add that which is\add* good in his sight. 
\v 14 So Joab and the people that \add were\add* with him drew nigh before the Syrians to the battle; and they fled before him. 
\v 15 And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem. 
\v 16 And when the Syrians saw that they were defeated before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that \add were\add* beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer \add went\add* before them. 
\v 17 And it was told to David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed over Jordan, and came upon them, and set \add the battle\add* in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him. 
\v 18 But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand \add men who fought in\add* chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host. 
\v 19 And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were defeated before Israel, they made peace with David, and became his servants: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more. 
\c 20  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass, that after the year had expired, at the time that kings go out \add to battle\add* , Joab led forth the power of the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it. 
\v 2 And David took the crown of their king from his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and \add there were\add* precious stones in it; and it was set upon David's head: and he brought also a great quantity of spoil out of the city. 
\v 3 And he brought out the people that \add were\add* in it, and cut \add them\add* with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so David dealt with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem. 
\v 4 And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines: at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai, \add that was\add* of the children of the giant: and they were subdued. 
\v 5 And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear-staff \add was\add* like a weaver's beam. 
\v 6 And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of \add great\add* stature, whose fingers and toes \add were\add* four and twenty, six \add on each hand\add* , and six \add on each foot\add* : and he also was the son of the giant. 
\v 7 But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea, David's brother, slew him. 
\v 8 These were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants. 
\c 21  
\p
\v 1 And Satan stood up against Israel, and incited David to number Israel. 
\v 2 And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel from Beer-sheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them to me, that I may know \add it\add* . 
\v 3 And Joab answered, the LORD make his people a hundred times more numerous than they \add are\add* : but, my lord the king, \add are\add* they not all my lord's servants? why then doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel? 
\v 4 Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem. 
\v 5 And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people to David. And all \add they of\add* Israel were a thousand thousand and a hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah \add was\add* four hundred and seventy thousand men that drew sword. 
\v 6 But Levi and Benjamin he counted not among them: for the king's word was abominable to Joab. 
\v 7 And God was displeased with this thing, therefore he smote Israel. 
\v 8 And David said to God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly. 
\v 9 And the LORD spoke to Gad, David's seer, saying, 
\v 10 Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee \add three\add* things; choose thee one of them, that I may do \add it\add* to thee. 
\v 11 So Gad came to David, and said to him, Thus saith the LORD, Choose thee 
\v 12 Either three years' famine; or three months to be destroyed before thy foes, while the sword of thy enemies overtaketh \add thee\add* ; or else three days the sword of the LORD, even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the borders of Israel. Now therefore advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent me. 
\v 13 And David said to Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of the LORD; for very great \add are\add* his mercies: but let me not fall into the hand of man. 
\v 14 So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men. 
\v 15 And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the LORD beheld, and he repented of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thy hand. And the angel of the LORD stood by the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite. 
\v 16 And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders \add of Israel\add* , \add who were\add* clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces. 
\v 17 And David said to God, \add Is it\add* not I \add that\add* commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but \add as for\add* these sheep, what have they done? let thy hand, I pray thee, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my father's house; but not on thy people, that they should be afflicted. 
\v 18 Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and erect an altar to the LORD in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite. 
\v 19 And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spoke in the name of the LORD. 
\v 20 And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat. 
\v 21 And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked, and saw David, and went out of the threshing-floor, and bowed himself to David with \add his\add* face to the ground. 
\v 22 Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of \add this\add* threshing-floor, that I may build an altar in it to the LORD: thou shalt grant it to me for the full price: that the plague may be stayed from the people. 
\v 23 And Ornan said to David, Take \add it\add* to thee, and let my lord the king do \add that which is\add* good in his eyes: lo, I give \add thee\add* the oxen \add also\add* for burnt-offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat-offering; I give it all. 
\v 24 And king David said to Ornan, No; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take \add that\add* which \add is\add* thine for the LORD, nor offer burnt-offerings without cost. 
\v 25 So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight. 
\v 26 And David built there an altar to the LORD, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and called upon the LORD; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt-offering. 
\v 27 And the LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into its sheath. 
\v 28 At that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there. 
\v 29 For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt-offering, \add were\add* at that season in the high place at Gibeon. 
\v 30 But David could not go before it to inquire of God: for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD. 
\c 22  
\p
\v 1 Then David said, This \add is\add* the house of the LORD God, and this \add is\add* the altar of the burnt-offering for Israel. 
\v 2 And David commanded to assemble the strangers that \add were\add* in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God. 
\v 3 And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance without weight; 
\v 4 Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David. 
\v 5 And David said, Solomon my son \add is\add* young and tender, and the house \add that is\add* to be built for the LORD \add must be\add* very magnificent, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will \add therefore\add* now make preparation for it. So David made abundant preparation before his death. 
\v 6 Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build a house for the LORD God of Israel. 
\v 7 And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build a house to the name of the LORD my God: 
\v 8 But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build a house to my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight. 
\v 9 Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies around: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days. 
\v 10 He shall build a house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I \add will be\add* his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever. 
\v 11 Now, my son, the LORD be with thee; and prosper thou, and build the house of the LORD thy God, as he hath said of thee. 
\v 12 Only the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep the law of the LORD thy God. 
\v 13 Then shalt thou prosper, if thou shalt take heed to fulfill the statutes and judgments which the LORD charged Moses with concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed. 
\v 14 Now behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the LORD a hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and thou mayest add to them. 
\v 15 Moreover, \add there are\add* workmen with thee in great numbers, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of skillful men for every manner of work. 
\v 16 Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, \add there is\add* no number. Arise \add therefore\add* , and be doing, and the LORD be with thee. 
\v 17 David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, \add saying\add* , 
\v 18  \add Is\add* not the LORD your God with you? and hath he \add not\add* given you rest on every side? for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into my hand; and the land is subdued before the LORD, and before his people. 
\v 19 Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God; arise, therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the LORD God, to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the LORD. 
\c 23  
\p
\v 1 So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel. 
\v 2 And he assembled all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites. 
\v 3 Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand. 
\v 4 Of which, twenty and four thousand \add were\add* to oversee the work of the house of the LORD; and six thousand \add were\add* officers and judges: 
\v 5 Moreover, four thousand \add were\add* porters; and four thousand praised the LORD with the instruments which I made, \add said David\add* , to praise \add with them\add* . 
\v 6 And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi, \add namely\add* , Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 
\v 7 Of the Gershonites, \add were\add* , Laadan and Shimei. 
\v 8 The sons of Laadan: the chief \add was\add* Jehiel, and Zetham, and Joel, three. 
\v 9 The sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These \add were\add* the chief of the fathers of Laadan. 
\v 10 And the sons of Shimei \add were\add* , Jahath, Zina, and Jeush and Beriah. These four \add were\add* the sons of Shimei. 
\v 11 And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they were in one reckoning, according to \add their\add* father's house. 
\v 12 The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four. 
\v 13 The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister to him, and to bless in his name for ever. 
\v 14 Now \add concerning\add* Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the tribe of Levi. 
\v 15 The sons of Moses \add were\add* , Gershom, and Eliezer. 
\v 16 Of the sons of Gershom; Shebuel \add was\add* the chief. 
\v 17 And the sons of Eliezer \add were\add* , Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer had no other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many. 
\v 18 Of the sons of Izhar; Shelomith the chief. 
\v 19 Of the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jehaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth. 
\v 20 Of the sons of Uzziel; Micah the first, and Jesiah the second. 
\v 21 The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli; Eleazar, and Kish. 
\v 22 And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their brethren the sons of Kish took them. 
\v 23 The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three. 
\v 24 These \add were\add* the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers; \add even\add* the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names by their polls, that did the work for the service of the house of the LORD, from the age of twenty years and upward. 
\v 25 For David said, The LORD God of Israel hath given rest to his people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem for ever; 
\v 26 And also to the Levites: they shall no \add more\add* carry the tabernacle, nor any vessels of it for its service. 
\v 27 For by the last words of David the Levites \add were\add* numbered from twenty years old and above: 
\v 28 Because their office \add was\add* to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God; 
\v 29 Both for the show-bread, and for the fine flour for meat-offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for \add that which is baked in\add* the pan, and for that which is fried, and for all manner of measure and size; 
\v 30 And to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and likewise at evening; 
\v 31 And to offer all burnt-sacrifices to the LORD on the sabbaths, in the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number, according to the order commanded to them, continually before the LORD: 
\v 32 And that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the holy \add place\add* , and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren, in the service of the house of the LORD. 
\c 24  
\p
\v 1 Now \add these are\add* the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron; Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 
\v 2 But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priests' office. 
\v 3 And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their offices in their service. 
\v 4 And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and \add thus\add* were they divided. Among the sons of Eleazar \add there were\add* sixteen chief men of the house of \add their\add* fathers, and eight among the sons of Ithamar according to the house of their fathers. 
\v 5 Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the governors of the sanctuary, and governors \add of the house\add* of God, were of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar. 
\v 6 And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, \add one\add* of the Levites, wrote them before the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and \add before\add* the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites: one principal household being taken for Eleazar, and \add one\add* taken for Ithamar. 
\v 7 Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah, 
\v 8 The third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim, 
\v 9 The fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin, 
\v 10 The seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah, 
\v 11 The ninth to Jeshuah, the tenth to Shecaniah, 
\v 12 The eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim, 
\v 13 The thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab, 
\v 14 The fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer, 
\v 15 The seventeenth to Hezer, the eighteenth to Aphses, 
\v 16 The nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezekel, 
\v 17 The one and twentieth to Jachin, the two and twentieth to Gamul, 
\v 18 The three and twentieth to Delaiah, the four and twentieth to Maaziah. 
\v 19 These \add were\add* the orderings of them in their service to come into the house of the LORD, according to their manner, under Aaron their father, as the LORD God of Israel had commanded him. 
\v 20 And the rest of the sons of Levi \add were these\add* : Of the sons of Amram; Shubael: of the sons of Shubael; Jehdeiah. 
\v 21 Concerning Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, the first \add was\add* Isshiah. 
\v 22 Of the Izharites; Shelomoth: of the sons of Shelomoth; Jahath. 
\v 23 And the sons \add of Hebron\add* ; Jeriah \add the first\add* , Amariah the second, Jehaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth. 
\v 24  \add Of\add* the sons of Uzziel; Michah: of the sons of Michah; Shamir. 
\v 25 The brother of Michah \add was\add* Isshiah: of the sons of Isshiah; Zechariah. 
\v 26 The sons of Merari \add were\add* Mahli, and Mushi: the sons of Jaaziah; Beno. 
\v 27 The sons of Merari by Jaaziah; Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur, and Ibri. 
\v 28 Of Mahli \add came\add* Eleazar, who had no sons. 
\v 29 Concerning Kish: the son of Kish \add was\add* Jerahmeel. 
\v 30 The sons also of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth. These \add were\add* the sons of the Levites after the house of their fathers. 
\v 31 These likewise cast lots over against their brethren the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites, even the principal fathers over against their younger brethren. 
\c 25  
\p
\v 1 Moreover David and the captains of the host separated to the service of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps, with psalteries, and with cymbals: and the number of the workmen according to their service was: 
\v 2 Of the sons of Asaph; Zaccur, and Joseph, and Nethaniah, and Asarelah, the sons of Asaph under the hands of Asaph, who prophesied according to the order of the king. 
\v 3 Of Jeduthun: the sons of Jeduthun; Gedaliah, and Zeri, and Jeshaiah, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six, under the hands of their father Jeduthun, who prophesied with a harp, to give thanks and to praise the LORD.

\v 13 And they cast lots, as well the small as the great, according to the house of their fathers, for every gate. 
\v 14 And the lot eastward fell to Shelemiah. Then for Zechariah his son, a wise counselor, they cast lots; and his lot came out northward.

\v 23 But David took not the number of them from twenty years old and under: because the LORD had said he would increase Israel like to the stars of the heavens. 
\v 24 Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number, but he finished not, because there fell wrath for it against Israel; neither was the number put in the account of the chronicles of king David. 
\v 25 And over the king's treasures \add was\add* Azmaveth the son of Adiel: and over the store-houses in the fields, in the cities, and in the villages, and in the castles, \add was\add* Jehonathan the son of Uzziah:

\c 28  
\p
\v 1 And David assembled all the princes of Israel, the princes of the tribes, and the captains of the companies that ministered to the king by course, and the captains over the thousands, and captains over the hundreds, and the stewards over all the substance and possession of the king, and of his sons, with the officers, and with the mighty men, and with all the valiant men to Jerusalem. 
\v 2 Then David the king stood upon his feet, and said, Hear me, my brethren, and my people: \add As for me\add* , I \add had\add* in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and for the footstool of our God, and had made ready for the building: 
\v 3 But God said to me, Thou shalt not build a house for my name, because thou \add hast been\add* a man of war, and hast shed blood. 
\v 4 However the LORD God of Israel chose me before all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever: for he hath chosen Judah \add to be\add* the ruler; and of the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he approved me to make \add me\add* king over all Israel: 
\v 5 And of all my sons, (for the LORD hath given me many sons,) he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel. 
\v 6 And he said to me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and my courts: for I have chosen him \add to be\add* my son, and I will be his father. 
\v 7 Moreover I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he shall be constant to do my commandments and my judgments, as at this day. 
\v 8 Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the LORD, and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for all the commandments of the LORD your God: that ye may possess this good land, and leave \add it\add* for an inheritance for your children after you for ever. 
\v 9 And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart, and with a willing mind: for the LORD searcheth all hearts and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts: if thou shalt seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou shalt forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever. 
\v 10 Take heed now; for the LORD hath chosen thee to build a house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do \add it\add* . 
\v 11 Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and of the houses of it, and of its treasuries, and of its upper chambers, and of its inner parlors, and of the place of the mercy-seat, 
\v 12 And the pattern of all that he had by the spirit, of the courts of the house of the LORD, and of all the chambers around, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries of the dedicated things: 
\v 13 Also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and for all the vessels of service in the house of the LORD. 
\v 14  \add He gave\add* of gold by weight for \add things\add* of gold, for all instruments of all manner of service; \add silver also\add* for all instruments of silver by weight, for all instruments of every kind of service: 
\v 15 Even the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and for their lamps of gold, by weight for every candlestick, and for its lamps: and for the candlesticks of silver by weight, \add both\add* for the candlestick, and \add also\add* for its lamps, according to the use of every candlestick. 
\v 16 And by weight \add he gave\add* gold for the tables of show-bread, for every table; and \add likewise\add* silver for the tables of silver: 
\v 17 Also pure gold for the flesh-hooks, and the bowls, and the cups: and for the golden basins \add he gave gold\add* by weight for every basin; and \add likewise silver\add* by weight for every basin of silver: 
\v 18 And for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubim, that spread out \add their wings\add* , and covered the ark of the covenant of the LORD. 
\v 19 All \add this\add* , \add said David\add* , the LORD made me understand in writing by \add his\add* hand upon me, \add even\add* all the works of this pattern. 
\v 20 And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong, and of good courage, and do \add it\add* : fear not, nor be dismayed, for the LORD God, \add even\add* my God, \add will be\add* with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of the LORD. 
\v 21 And behold, the courses of the priests and the Levites, \add even they shall be with thee\add* for all the service of the house of God: and \add there shall be\add* with thee for all manner of workmanship every willing skillful man, for any manner of service: also the princes and all the people \add will be\add* wholly at thy command. 
\c 29  
\p
\v 1 Furthermore David the king said to all the congregation, Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, \add is yet\add* young and tender, and the work \add is\add* great: for the palace \add is\add* not for man, but for the LORD God. 
\v 2 Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for \add things to be made\add* of gold, and the silver for \add things\add* of silver, and the brass for \add things\add* of brass, the iron for \add things\add* of iron, and wood for \add things\add* of wood; onyx-stones, and \add stones\add* to be set, glittering stones, and of divers colors, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance. 
\v 3 Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my God, I have of my own possessions, of gold and silver, \add which\add* I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house, 
\v 4  \add Even\add* three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses: 
\v 5 The gold for \add things\add* of gold, and the silver for \add things\add* of silver, and for all manner of work \add to be made\add* by the hands of artificers. And who \add then\add* is willing to consecrate his service this day to the LORD? 
\v 6 Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers over the king's work, offered willingly, 
\v 7 And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron. 
\v 8 And they with whom \add precious\add* stones were found gave \add them\add* to the treasure of the house of the LORD, by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite. 
\v 9 Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy. 
\v 10 Wherefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation: and David said, Blessed \add be\add* thou, LORD God of Israel our father, for ever and ever. 
\v 11 Thine, O LORD, \add is\add* the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all \add that is\add* in the heaven and on the earth \add is thine\add* ; thine \add is\add* the kingdom, O LORD, and thou art exalted as head above all. 
\v 12 Both riches and honor \add come\add* from thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thy hand \add is\add* power and might; and in thy hand \add it is\add* to make great, and to give strength to all. 
\v 13 Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name. 
\v 14 But who \add am\add* I, and what \add is\add* my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things \add come\add* from thee, and of thy own have we given thee. 
\v 15 For we \add are\add* strangers before thee, and sojourners, as \add were\add* all our fathers: our days on the earth \add are\add* as a shadow, and \add there is\add* no abiding. 
\v 16 O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee a house for thy holy name \add cometh\add* from thy hand, and \add is\add* all thy own. 
\v 17 I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy thy people, who are present here, to offer willingly to thee. 
\v 18 O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart to thee: 
\v 19 And give to Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all \add these things\add* , and to build the palace, \add for\add* which I have made provision. 
\v 20 And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your God. And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers, and bowed their heads, and worshiped the LORD, and the king. 
\v 21 And they sacrificed sacrifices to the LORD, and offered burnt-offerings to the LORD, on the morrow after that day, \add even\add* a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, \add and\add* a thousand lambs, with their drink-offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel: 
\v 22 And ate and drank before the LORD on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed \add him\add* to the LORD \add to be\add* the chief governor, and Zadok \add to be\add* priest. 
\v 23 Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him. 
\v 24 And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves to Solomon the king. 
\v 25 And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him \add such\add* royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel. 
\v 26 Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel. 
\v 27 And the time that he reigned over Israel \add was\add* forty years; seven years he reigned in Hebron, and thirty and three \add years\add* he reigned in Jerusalem. 
\v 28 And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead. 
\v 29 Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they \add are\add* written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer, 
\v 30 With all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.
