\v 1 The word of the LORD that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, \add and\add* Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem. 
\v 2 Hear, all ye people; hearken, O earth, and all that therein is: and let the Lord GOD be witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple. 
\v 3 For behold, the LORD cometh forth from his place, and will come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth. 
\v 4 And the mountains shall be melted under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, \add and\add* as the waters \add that are\add* poured down a steep place. 
\v 5 For the transgression of Jacob \add is\add* all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What \add is\add* the transgression of Jacob? \add is it\add* not Samaria? and what \add are\add* the high places of Judah? \add are they\add* not Jerusalem? 
\v 6 Therefore I will make Samaria as a heap of the field, \add and\add* as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down her stones into the valley, and I will lay bare her foundations. 
\v 7 And all her graven images shall be beaten to pieces, and all her hires shall be burned with the fire, and all her idols will I lay desolate: for she gathered \add it\add* from the hire of a harlot, and they shall return to the hire of a harlot. 
\v 8 Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls. 
\v 9 For her wound \add is\add* incurable; for it is come to Judah; he is come to the gate of my people, \add even\add* to Jerusalem. 
\v 10 Declare ye \add it\add* not at Gath, weep ye not at all: in the house of Aphrah roll thyself in the dust. 
\v 11 Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame exposed: the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Beth-ezel; he shall receive from you his standing. 
\v 12 For the inhabitant of Maroth waited anxiously for good: but evil came down from the LORD to the gate of Jerusalem. 
\v 13 O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift beast: she \add is\add* the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion: for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee. 
\v 14 Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moresheth-gath: the houses of Achzib \add shall be\add* a lie to the kings of Israel. 
\v 15 Yet will I bring an heir to thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah: he shall come to Adullam the glory of Israel. 
\v 16 Make thee bald, and poll thee for thy delicate children; enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from thee. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practice it, because it is in the power of their hand. 
\v 2 And they covet fields, and take \add them\add* by violence; and houses, and take \add them\add* away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage. 
\v 3 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither shall ye go haughtily: for this time \add is\add* evil. 
\v 4 In that day shall \add one\add* take up a parable against you, and lament with a grievous lamentation, \add and\add* say, We are utterly wasted: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed \add it\add* from me! turning away he hath divided our fields. 
\v 5 Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the LORD. 
\v 6 Prophesy ye not, \add say they to them that\add* prophesy: they shall not prophesy to them, \add that\add* they shall not take shame. 
\v 7 O \add thou that art\add* named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the LORD straitened? are these his doings? do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly? 
\v 8 Even of late my people hath risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse to war. 
\v 9 The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever. 
\v 10 Arise ye, and depart; for this \add is\add* not \add your\add* rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy \add you\add* , even with a grievous destruction. 
\v 11 If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood doth lie, \add saying\add* , I will prophesy to thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people. 
\v 12 I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of \add the multitude of\add* men. 
\v 13 The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and have gone out by it; and their king shall pass before them, and the LORD on the head of them. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the house of Israel: \add Is it\add* not for you to know judgment? 
\v 2 Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from them, and their flesh from off their bones; 
\v 3 Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron. 
\v 4 Then shall they cry to the LORD, but he will not hear them: he will even hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings. 
\v 5 Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make my people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him: 
\v 6 Therefore night \add shall be\add* to you, that ye shall not have a vision; and it shall be dark to you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them. 
\v 7 Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yes, they shall all cover their lips; for \add there is\add* no answer of God. 
\v 8 But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the LORD, and of judgment, and of might, to declare to Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin. 
\v 9 Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and princes of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity. 
\v 10 They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity. 
\v 11 Her heads judge for reward, and her priests teach for hire, and her prophets divine for money; yet will they lean upon the LORD, and say, \add Is\add* not the LORD among us? no evil can come upon us. 
\v 12 Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed \add as\add* a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 But in the last days it shall come to pass, \add that\add* the mount of the house of the LORD shall be established on the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow to it. 
\v 2 And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall go forth from Zion, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem. 
\v 3 And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plow-shares, and their spears into pruning-hooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. 
\v 4 But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig-tree; and none shall make \add them\add* afraid: for the mouth of the LORD of hosts hath spoken \add it\add* . 
\v 5 For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and ever. 
\v 6 In that day, saith the LORD, I will assemble her that halteth, and I will gather her that is driven out, and her that I have afflicted; 
\v 7 And I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast far off a strong nation: and the LORD will reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth, even for ever. 
\v 8 And thou, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of Zion, to thee shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom shall come, to the daughter of Jerusalem. 
\v 9 Now why dost thou cry aloud? \add is there\add* no king in thee? hath thy counselor perished? for pangs have taken thee as a woman in travail. 
\v 10 Be in pain, and labor to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail: for now shalt thou go forth from the city, and thou shalt dwell in the field, and thou shalt go \add even\add* to Babylon; there shalt thou be delivered; there the LORD shall redeem thee from the hand of thy enemies. 
\v 11 Now also many nations are gathered against thee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion. 
\v 12 But they know not the thoughts of the LORD, neither understand they his counsel: for he will gather them as sheaves into the floor. 
\v 13 Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make thy horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass: and thou shalt beat in pieces many people: and I will consecrate their gain to JEHOVAH, and their substance to the Lord of the whole earth. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 Now gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops: he hath laid siege against us: they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek. 
\v 2 But thou, Beth-lehem Ephratah, \add though\add* thou art little among the thousands of Judah, \add yet\add* out of thee shall he come forth to me \add that is\add* to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth \add have been\add* from of old, from everlasting. 
\v 3 Therefore will he give them up, until the time \add that\add* she who travaileth hath brought forth: then the remnant of his brethren shall return to the children of Israel. 
\v 4 And he will stand and feed in the strength of the LORD, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God; and they shall abide: for now will he be great to the ends of the earth. 
\v 5 And this \add man\add* will be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come into our land: and when he shall tread in our palaces, then shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal men. 
\v 6 And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod in its entrances: thus will he deliver \add us\add* from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he treadeth within our borders. 
\v 7 And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a dew from the LORD, as the showers upon the grass, that tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the sons of men. 
\v 8 And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the gentiles in the midst of many people as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep: who, if he goeth through, both treadeth down, and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver. 
\v 9 Thy hand shall be lifted up upon thy adversaries, and all thy enemies shall be cut off. 
\v 10 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy thy chariots: 
\v 11 And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all thy strong holds: 
\v 12 And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thy hand; and thou shalt have no \add more\add* sooth-sayers: 
\v 13 Thy graven images also will I cut off, and thy standing images out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thy hands. 
\v 14 And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee: so will I destroy thy cities. 
\v 15 And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen, such as they have not heard. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1 Hear ye now what the LORD saith; Arise, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice. 
\v 2 Hear ye, O mountains, the LORD'S controversy, and ye strong foundations of the earth: for the LORD hath a controversy with his people, and he will plead with Israel. 
\v 3 O my people, what have I done to thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me, 
\v 4 For I brought thee out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee from the house of servants; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. 
\v 5 O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim to Gilgal; that ye may know the righteousness of the LORD. 
\v 6 Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, \add and\add* bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt-offerings, with calves of a year old? 
\v 7 Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, \add or\add* with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my first-born \add for\add* my transgression, the fruit of my body \add for\add* the sin of my soul? 
\v 8 He hath shown thee, O man, what \add is\add* good; and what the LORD doth require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God? 
\v 9 The LORD'S voice crieth to the city, and \add the man of\add* wisdom shall see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it. 
\v 10 Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure \add that is\add* abominable? 
\v 11 Shall I count \add them\add* pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag of deceitful weights? 
\v 12 For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue \add is\add* deceitful in their mouth. 
\v 13 Therefore also will I make \add thee\add* sick in smiting thee, in making \add thee\add* desolate because of thy sins. 
\v 14 Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy casting down \add shall be\add* in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take hold, but shalt not deliver; and \add that\add* which thou deliverest will I give up to the sword. 
\v 15 Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and sweet wine, but shalt not drink wine. 
\v 16 For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I should make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing: therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people.

\v 1 Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grape-gleanings of the vintage: \add there is\add* no cluster to eat: my soul desired the first ripe fruit. 
\v 2 The good \add man\add* hath perished from the earth: and \add there is\add* none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net. 
\v 3 That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince asketh, and the judge \add asketh\add* for a reward; and the great \add man\add* , he uttereth his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up. 
\v 4 The best of them \add is\add* as a brier: the most upright \add is sharper\add* than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen \add and\add* thy visitation cometh; now shall be their perplexity. 
\v 5 Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide: keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom. 
\v 6 For the son dishonoreth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; a man's enemies \add are\add* the men of his own house. 
\v 7 Therefore I will look to the LORD; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me. 
\v 8 Rejoice not against me, O my enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD \add will be\add* a light to me. 
\v 9 I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned against him, until he shall plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, \add and\add* I shall behold his righteousness. 
\v 10 Then \add she that is\add* my enemy shall see \add it\add* , and shame shall cover her who said to me, Where is the LORD thy God? my eyes shall behold her: now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets. 
\v 11  \add In\add* the day that thy walls are to be built, \add in\add* that day shall the decree be far removed. 
\v 12  \add In\add* that day \add also\add* he shall come even to thee from Assyria, and \add from\add* the fortified cities, and from the fortress even to the river, and from sea to sea, and \add from\add* mountain to mountain. 
\v 13 Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell in it, for the fruit of their doings. 
\v 14 Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thy heritage, who dwell solitarily \add in\add* the wood, in the midst of Carmel: let them feed \add in\add* Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old. 
\v 15 According to the days of thy departure from the land of Egypt will I show to him marvelous \add things\add* . 
\v 16 The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might: they shall lay \add their\add* hand upon \add their\add* mouth, their ears shall be deaf. 
\v 17 They shall lick the dust like a serpent, they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth: they shall be afraid of the LORD our God, and shall fear because of thee. 
\v 18 Who \add is\add* a God like to thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth \add in\add* mercy. 
\v 19 He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea. 
\v 20 Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, \add and\add* the mercy to Abraham, which thou hast sworn to our fathers from the days of old.
