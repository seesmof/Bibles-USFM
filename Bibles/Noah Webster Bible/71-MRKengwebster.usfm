\mt1 THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST. MARK 
\c 1  
\p
\v 1 The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ the Son of God; 
\v 2 As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee; 
\v 3 The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. 
\v 4 John was baptizing in the wilderness, and preaching the baptism of repentance, for the remission of sins. 
\v 5 And there went out to him all the land of Judea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. 
\v 6 And John was clothed with camels hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he ate locusts and wild honey; 
\v 7 And preached, saying, There cometh after me one mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose. 
\v 8 I indeed have baptized you with water: but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit. 
\v 9 And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth to Galilee, and was baptized by John in Jordan. 
\v 10 And immediately coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him. 
\v 11 And there came a voice from heaven, \add saying\add* , Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. 
\v 12 And immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness. 
\v 13 And he was there in the wilderness forty days tempted by Satan: and was with the wild beasts, and the angels ministered to him. 
\v 14 Now after John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, 
\v 15 And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel. 
\v 16 Now as he was walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers. 
\v 17 And Jesus said to them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men. 
\v 18 And immediately they forsook their nets, and followed him. 
\v 19 And when he had gone a little further thence, he saw James the \add son\add* of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the boat mending their nets. 
\v 20 And immediately he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him. 
\v 21 And they went into Capernaum; and immediately on the sabbath he entered into the synagogue and taught. 
\v 22 And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes. 
\v 23 And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out, 
\v 24 Saying, Let \add us\add* alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God. 
\v 25 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. 
\v 26 And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him. 
\v 27 And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine \add is\add* this? for with authority he commandeth even the unclean spirits, and they obey him. 
\v 28 And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region around Galilee. 
\v 29 And forthwith, when they had come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. 
\v 30 But the mother of Simon's wife lay sick with a fever; and forthwith they tell him of her. 
\v 31 And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered to them. 
\v 32 And at evening, when the sun had set, they brought to him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with demons. 
\v 33 And all the city was gathered at the door. 
\v 34 And he healed many that were sick with divers diseases, and cast out many demons; and suffered not the demons to speak, because they knew him. 
\v 35 And in the morning, rising a great while before day, he went out and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed. 
\v 36 And Simon, and they that were with him, followed after him. 
\v 37 And when they had found him, they said to him, All \add men\add* seek for thee. 
\v 38 And he said to them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for, for this purpose have I come. 
\v 39 And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out demons. 
\v 40 And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying to him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. 
\v 41 And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth \add his\add* hand, and touched him, and saith to him, I will; be thou clean. 
\v 42 And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed. 
\v 43 And he strictly charged him, and forthwith sent him away; 
\v 44 And saith to him, See thou say nothing to any man; but go, show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them. 
\v 45 But he went out, and began to publish \add it\add* much, and to blaze abroad the matter, so that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 And again he entered into Capernaum, after \add some\add* days; and it was understood that he was in the house. 
\v 2 And forthwith many were assembled, so that there was no room to receive \add them\add* , no not so much as about the door: and he preached the word to them. 
\v 3 And they come to him, bringing one sick with the palsy, who was borne by four. 
\v 4 And when they could not come nigh to him by reason of the crowd, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken \add it\add* up, they let down the bed on which the sick with the palsy lay. 
\v 5 When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the sick with the palsy, Son, thy sins are forgiven thee. 
\v 6 But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts, 
\v 7 Why doth this \add man\add* thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only? 
\v 8 And immediately, when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said to them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts? 
\v 9 Which is easier, to say to the sick with the palsy, \add Thy\add* sins are forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk? 
\v 10 But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, he saith to the sick with the palsy, 
\v 11 I say to thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go into thy house. 
\v 12 And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; so that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion. 
\v 13 And he went forth again by the sea -\add side\add* ; and all the multitude resorted to him, and he taught them. 
\v 14 And as he passed by, he saw Levi the \add son\add* of Alpheus, sitting at the receipt of custom, and said to him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him. 
\v 15 And it came to pass, that as Jesus sat at table in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples; for there were many, and they followed him. 
\v 16 And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eating with publicans and sinners, they said to his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners. 
\v 17 When Jesus heard \add it\add* , he saith to them, They that are in health, have no need of a physician, but they that are sick; I came not to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance. 
\v 18 And the disciples of John, and of the Pharisees, used to fast: and they come, and say to him, Why do the disciples of John, and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not? 
\v 19 And Jesus said to them, Can the children of the bride-chamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast. 
\v 20 But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then they will fast in those days. 
\v 21 No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up, taketh away from the old, and the rent is made worse. 
\v 22 And no man putteth new wine into old bottles, else the new wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles. 
\v 23 And it came to pass, that he went through the corn-fields on the sabbath; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn. 
\v 24 And the Pharisees said to him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath that which is not lawful? 
\v 25 And he said to them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was hungry, he and they that were with him? 
\v 26 How he went into the house of God, in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the show-bread, which it is not lawful to eat, but for the priests, and gave also to them who were with him? 
\v 27 And he said to them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath: 
\v 28 Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there who had a withered hand. 
\v 2 And they watched him, \add to see\add* whether he would heal him on the sabbath; that they might accuse him. 
\v 3 And he saith to the man who had the withered hand, Stand forth. 
\v 4 And he saith to them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? but they held their peace. 
\v 5 And when he had looked around on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith to the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched \add it\add* out: and his hand was restored whole as the other. 
\v 6 And the Pharisees went forth, and immediately took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him. 
\v 7 But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judea. 
\v 8 And from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and \add from\add* beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came to him. 
\v 9 And he spoke to his disciples, that a small boat should wait on him, because of the multitude, lest they should throng him. 
\v 10 For he had healed many; so that they pressed upon him to touch him, as many as had diseases. 
\v 11 And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God. 
\v 12 And he strictly charged them, that they should not make him known. 
\v 13 And he goeth up upon a mountain, and calleth \add to him\add* whom he would: and they came to him. 
\v 14 And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach, 
\v 15 And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out demons. 
\v 16 And Simon he surnamed Peter. 
\v 17 And James the \add son\add* of Zebedee, and John the brother of James, (and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, Sons of thunder,) 
\v 18 And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the \add son\add* of Alpheus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the Canaanite, 
\v 19 And Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him: and they went into a house. 
\v 20 And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread. 
\v 21 And when his friends heard \add of it\add* , they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself. 
\v 22 And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem, said, He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of the demons he casteth out demons. 
\v 23 And he called them \add to him\add* , and said to them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan? 
\v 24 And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. 
\v 25 And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand. 
\v 26 And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end. 
\v 27 No man can enter into a strong man's house, and seize his goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will plunder his house. 
\v 28 Verily I say to you, All sins shall be forgiven to the sons of men, and any blasphemies with which they shall blaspheme: 
\v 29 But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Spirit never hath forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation: 
\v 30 Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit. 
\v 31 There came then his brethren and his mother, and standing without, they sent to him, calling him. 
\v 32 And the multitude sat about him, and they said to him, Behold, thy mother, and thy brethren without seek for thee. 
\v 33 And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren? 
\v 34 And he looked around on them who sat about him, and said, Behold, my mother and my brethren! 
\v 35 For whoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 And he began again to teach by the sea-side: and there was gathered to him a great multitude, so that he entered into a boat, and sat on the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea, on the land. 
\v 2 And he taught them many things by parables, and said to them in his doctrine, 
\v 3 Hearken; Behold, a sower went out to sow: 
\v 4 And it came to pass as he sowed, some fell by the way-side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it. 
\v 5 And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth. 
\v 6 But when the sun had risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away. 
\v 7 And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit. 
\v 8 And other fell on good ground, and yielded fruit that sprang up, and increased, and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some a hundred. 
\v 9 And he said to them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. 
\v 10 And when he was alone, they that were about him, with the twelve, asked of him the parable. 
\v 11 And he said to them, To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but to them that are without, all \add these\add* things are done in parables: 
\v 12 That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and \add their\add* sins should be forgiven them. 
\v 13 And he said to them, Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables? 
\v 14 The sower soweth the word. 
\v 15 And these are they by the way-side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts. 
\v 16 And these are they likewise who are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness; 
\v 17 And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they relapse. 
\v 18 And these are they who are sown among thorns; such as hear the word, 
\v 19 And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful. 
\v 20 And these are they who are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive \add it\add* , and bring forth fruit, some thirty-fold, some sixty, and some a hundred. 
\v 21 And he said to them, Is a candle brought to be put under a close vessel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick? 
\v 22 For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither hath any thing been kept secret, but that it should come abroad. 
\v 23 If any man hath ears to hear, let him hear. 
\v 24 And he said to them, Take heed what ye hear: With the measure which ye give, it shall be measured to you: and to you that hear shall more be given. 
\v 25 For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath. 
\v 26 And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground; 
\v 27 And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how. 
\v 28 For the earth bringeth forth fruit of itself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear. 
\v 29 But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come. 
\v 30 And he said, To what shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it? 
\v 31  \add It is\add* like a grain of mustard-seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that are in the earth. 
\v 32 But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under its shade. 
\v 33 And with many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear \add it\add* . 
\v 34 But without a parable he spoke not to them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples. 
\v 35 And the same day, when the evening was come, he saith to them, Let us pass over to the other side. 
\v 36 And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the boat. And there were also with him other small boats. 
\v 37 And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the boat, so that it was now full. 
\v 38 And he was in the hinder part of the boat, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say to him, Master, carest thou not that we perish? 
\v 39 And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, Peace, be still: and the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. 
\v 40 And he said to them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith? 
\v 41 And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him? 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 And they came over to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes. 
\v 2 And when he had come out of the boat, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit, 
\v 3 Who had \add his\add* dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains: 
\v 4 For he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any \add man\add* tame him. 
\v 5 And always, night and day, he was on the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones. 
\v 6 But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshiped him, 
\v 7 And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, \add thou\add* Son of the Most High God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not. 
\v 8 (For he said to him, Come out of the man, \add thou\add* unclean spirit.) 
\v 9 And he asked him, What \add is\add* thy name? And he answered, saying, My name \add is\add* Legion: for we are many. 
\v 10 And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country. 
\v 11 Now there was there nigh to the mountains a great herd of swine feeding. 
\v 12 And all the demons besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them. 
\v 13 And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea (they were about two thousand) and were choked in the sea. 
\v 14 And they that fed the swine fled, and told \add it\add* in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done. 
\v 15 And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the demon, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid. 
\v 16 And they that saw \add it\add* told them how it befell him that was possessed with the demon, and \add also\add* concerning the swine. 
\v 17 And they began to pray him to depart out of their borders. 
\v 18 And when he had come into the boat, he that had been possessed with the demon prayed him that he might be with him. 
\v 19 Yet Jesus suffered him not, but saith to him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee. 
\v 20 And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him. And all \add men\add* wondered. 
\v 21 And when Jesus had passed over again in a boat to the other side, much people gathered to him: and he was nigh to the sea. 
\v 22 And behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet, 
\v 23 And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of death: \add I pray thee\add* , come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she will live. 
\v 24 And \add Jesus\add* went with him; and many people followed him, and thronged him. 
\v 25 And a certain woman who had an issue of blood twelve years, 
\v 26 And had suffered many things from many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was not relieved, but rather grew worse, 
\v 27 When she had heard of Jesus, came in the crowd behind, and touched his garment. 
\v 28 For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole. 
\v 29 And immediately the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in \add her\add* body that she was healed of that infirmity. 
\v 30 And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the throng, and said, Who touched my clothes? 
\v 31 And his disciples said to him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me? 
\v 32 And he looked around, to see her that had done this thing. 
\v 33 But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth. 
\v 34 And he said to her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be healed of thy infirmity. 
\v 35 While he was yet speaking, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's \add house certain\add* who said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master any further? 
\v 36 As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith to the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe, 
\v 37 And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James. 
\v 38 And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly. 
\v 39 And when he had come in, he saith to them, Why make ye this tumult, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth. 
\v 40 And they derided him: but when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying. 
\v 41 And he took the damsel by the hand, and said to her, Talitha cumi: which is, being interpreted, Damsel (I say to thee) arise. 
\v 42 And forthwith the damsel arose, and walked; for she was \add of the age\add* of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment. 
\v 43 And he charged them strictly that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1 And he went out from thence, and came into his own country, and his disciples follow him. 
\v 2 And when the sabbath was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing \add him\add* were astonished, saying, From whence hath this \add man\add* these things? and what wisdom \add is\add* this which is given to him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands? 
\v 3 Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Judas, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him. 
\v 4 But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor, but in his own country, and among his own kindred, and in his own house. 
\v 5 And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick persons, and healed \add them\add* . 
\v 6 And he marveled because of their unbelief. And he went around the villages teaching. 
\v 7 And he calleth \add to him\add* the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits; 
\v 8 And commanded them that they should take nothing for \add their\add* journey, save a staff only; no bag, no bread, no money in \add their\add* purse: 
\v 9 But \add be\add* shod with sandals; and not put on two coats. 
\v 10 And he said to them, In whatever place ye enter into a house, there abide till ye depart from that place. 
\v 11 And whoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence shake off the dust under your feet, for a testimony against them. Verily I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that city. 
\v 12 And they went out and preached that men should repent. 
\v 13 And they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed \add them\add* . 
\v 14 And king Herod heard \add of him\add* (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist had risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do show forth themselves in him. 
\v 15 Others said, That it is Elijah. And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets. 
\v 16 But when Herod heard \add of him\add* , he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he hath risen from the dead. 
\v 17 For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife: for he had married her. 
\v 18 For John had said to Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife. 
\v 19 Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not: 
\v 20 For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just and holy man, and observed him: and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly. 
\v 21 And when a convenient day had come, that Herod on his birth-day made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief \add men\add* of Galilee; 
\v 22 And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod, and them that sat with him, the king said to the damsel, Ask of me whatever thou wilt, and I will give \add it\add* thee. 
\v 23 And he swore to her, Whatever thou shalt ask of me, I will give \add it\add* thee, to the half of my kingdom. 
\v 24 And she went forth, and said to her mother, What shall I ask? and she said, The head of John the Baptist. 
\v 25 And she came in forthwith with haste to the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou shouldst give me, immediately, in a dish, the head of John the Baptist. 
\v 26 And the king was exceeding sorry: \add yet\add* for his oath's sake, and for their sakes who sat with him, he would not reject her. 
\v 27 And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison, 
\v 28 And brought his head in a dish, and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother. 
\v 29 And when his disciples heard \add of it\add* , they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb. 
\v 30 And the apostles assembled themselves to Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught. 
\v 31 And he said to them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat. 
\v 32 And they departed into a desert place in a boat privately. 
\v 33 And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran on foot thither out of all cities, and out went them, and came together to him. 
\v 34 And Jesus, when he came out, saw many people, and was moved with compassion towards them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things. 
\v 35 And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came to him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time \add is\add* far passed: 
\v 36 Send them away, that they may go into the country around, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat. 
\v 37 He answered and said to them, Give ye them to eat. And they say to him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat? 
\v 38 He saith to them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes. 
\v 39 And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass. 
\v 40 And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties. 
\v 41 And when he had taken the five loaves, and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and broke the loaves, and gave \add them\add* to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes he divided among them all. 
\v 42 And they all ate, and were satisfied. 
\v 43 And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes. 
\v 44 And they that ate of the loaves, were about five thousand men. 
\v 45 And immediately he constrained his disciples to get into the boat, and to go to the other side before to Bethsaida, while he sent away the people. 
\v 46 And when he had dismissed them, he departed to a mountain to pray. 
\v 47 And when evening was come, the boat was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land. 
\v 48 And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary to them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh to them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them. 
\v 49 But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit, and cried out. 
\v 50 (For they all saw him, and were troubled.) And immediately he talked with them, and saith to them, Be of good cheer: It is I; be not afraid. 
\v 51 And he went up to them into the boat; and the wind ceased: and they were greatly amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered. 
\v 52 For they considered not \add the miracle\add* of the loaves; for their heart was hardened. 
\v 53 And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore. 
\v 54 And when they had come out of the boat forthwith they knew him, 
\v 55 And ran through that whole region around, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was. 
\v 56 And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch, if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him, were healed. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1 Then came together to him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, who came from Jerusalem. 
\v 2 And when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with defiled (that is to say with unwashed) hands, they found fault. 
\v 3 For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash \add their\add* hands often eat not, holding the tradition of the elders. 
\v 4 And \add when they come\add* from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there are, which they have received to hold, \add as\add* the washing of cups, and pots, and of brazen vessels, and tables. 
\v 5 Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashed hands? 
\v 6 He answered and said to them, Well hath Isaiah prophesied concerning you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoreth me with \add their\add* lips, but their heart is far from me. 
\v 7 But, in vain do they worship me, teaching \add for\add* doctrines the commandments of men. 
\v 8 For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, \add as\add* the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do. 
\v 9 And he said to them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition, 
\v 10 For Moses said, Honor thy father and thy mother; and, Whoever curseth father or mother, let him die the death: 
\v 11 But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, \add It is\add* Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatever thou mightest be profited by me; \add he shall be free\add* . 
\v 12 And ye suffer him no more to do aught for his father or his mother; 
\v 13 Making the word of God of no effect through your traditions, which ye have delivered: and many such like things ye do. 
\v 14 And when he had called all the people \add to him\add* , he said to them, Hearken to me every one \add of you\add* , and understand. 
\v 15 There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him, can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man. 
\v 16 If any man hath ears to hear, let him hear. 
\v 17 And when he had entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable. 
\v 18 And he saith to them, Are ye so void of understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatever thing from without entereth into the man, \add it\add* cannot defile him. 
\v 19 Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all kinds of food. 
\v 20 And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man. 
\v 21 For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, 
\v 22 Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness; 
\v 23 All these evil things come from within, and defile the man. 
\v 24 And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into a house, and would have no man know \add it\add* : but he could not be hid. 
\v 25 For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet: 
\v 26 (The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation,) and she besought him that he would cast forth the demon out of her daughter. 
\v 27 But Jesus said to her, Let the children first be satisfied: for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast \add it\add* to the dogs. 
\v 28 And she answered and said to him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crums. 
\v 29 And he said to her, For this saying, depart; the demon is gone out of thy daughter. 
\v 30 And when she had come to her house, she found the demon had gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed. 
\v 31 And again, departing from the borders of Tyre and Sidon, he came to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the borders of Decapolis. 
\v 32 And they bring to him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him. 
\v 33 And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue. 
\v 34 And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith to him, Effatha, that is, Be opened. 
\v 35 And immediately his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke plain. 
\v 36 And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them; so much the more a great deal they published \add it\add* ; 
\v 37 And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well; he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1 In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples, and saith to them, 
\v 2 I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat: 
\v 3 And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for some of them came from a distance. 
\v 4 And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these \add men\add* with bread here in the wilderness? 
\v 5 And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven. 
\v 6 And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and broke, and gave to his disciples to set before \add them\add* ; and they set \add them\add* before the people. 
\v 7 And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before \add them\add* . 
\v 8 So they ate, and were satisfied: and they took up of the fragments that were left, seven baskets. 
\v 9 And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he dismissed them. 
\v 10 And forthwith he entered into a boat with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha. 
\v 11 And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking from him a sign from heaven, tempting him. 
\v 12 And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek for a sign? Verily I say to you, There shall no sign be given to this generation. 
\v 13 And he left them, and entering into the boat again, departed to the other side. 
\v 14 Now \add the disciples\add* had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the boat with them more than one loaf. 
\v 15 And he charged them saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and \add of\add* the leaven of Herod. 
\v 16 And they reasoned among themselves, saying, \add It is\add* because we have no bread. 
\v 17 And when Jesus knew \add it\add* , he saith to them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened? 
\v 18 Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember? 
\v 19 When I divided the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say to him, Twelve. 
\v 20 And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven. 
\v 21 And he said to them, How is it that ye do not understand? 
\v 22 And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man to him, and besought him to touch him. 
\v 23 And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw aught. 
\v 24 And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees walking. 
\v 25 After that, he put \add his\add* hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly. 
\v 26 And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell \add it\add* to any in the town. 
\v 27 And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Cesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying to them, Who do men say that I am? 
\v 28 And they answered, John the Baptist: but some \add say\add* , Elijah; and others, One of the prophets, 
\v 29 And he saith to them, But who say ye that I am? And Peter answereth and saith to him, Thou art the Christ. 
\v 30 And he charged them that they should tell no man of him. 
\v 31 And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, and the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again. 
\v 32 And he spoke that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him. 
\v 33 But when he had turned about, and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savorest not the things that are of God, but the things that are of men. 
\v 34 And when he had called the people \add to him\add* with his disciples also, he said to them, Whoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. 
\v 35 For whoever will save his life, shall lose it; but whoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it. 
\v 36 For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul: 
\v 37 Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul? 
\v 38 Whoever therefore shall be ashamed of me, and of my words, in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also will the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 And he said to them, Verily I say to you, that there are some of them that stand here who shall not taste death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power. 
\v 2 And after six days, Jesus taketh \add with him\add* Peter, and James, and John, and leadeth them up upon a high mountain apart by themselves; and he was transfigured before them. 
\v 3 And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can whiten them. 
\v 4 And there appeared to them Elijah, with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus. 
\v 5 And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah. 
\v 6 For he knew not what to say: for they were greatly terrified. 
\v 7 And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him. 
\v 8 And suddenly, when they had looked around, they saw no man any more, save Jesus only with themselves. 
\v 9 And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son of man were risen from the dead. 
\v 10 And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean. 
\v 11 And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elijah must first come? 
\v 12 And he answered and told them, Elijah verily cometh first, and restoreth all things; and how it is written concerning the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at naught. 
\v 13 But I say to you, that Elijah is indeed come, and they have done to him whatever they pleased, as it is written concerning him. 
\v 14 And when he came to \add his\add* disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes questioning with them. 
\v 15 And immediately all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and running to \add him\add* , saluted him. 
\v 16 And he asked the scribes, What question ye with them? 
\v 17 And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought to thee my son, who hath a dumb spirit; 
\v 18 And wherever he taketh him, he teareth him; and he foameth and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away; and I spoke to thy disciples that they should cast him out, and they could not. 
\v 19 He answered him, and saith, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you, how long shall I suffer you? bring him to me. 
\v 20 And they brought him to him: and when he saw him, immediately the spirit tore him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed, foaming. 
\v 21 And he asked his father, How long is it since this came to him? and he said, From a child. 
\v 22 And often it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us. 
\v 23 Jesus said to him, If thou canst believe, all things \add are\add* possible to him that believeth. 
\v 24 And immediately the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou my unbelief. 
\v 25 When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying to him, \add Thou\add* dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him. 
\v 26 And \add the spirit\add* cried, and rent him severely, and came out of him: and he was as one dead; so that many said, He is dead. 
\v 27 But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose. 
\v 28 And when he had come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out? 
\v 29 And he said to them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting. 
\v 30 And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know \add it\add* . 
\v 31 For he taught his disciples, and said to them, The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill him; and after that he is killed, he will rise the third day. 
\v 32 But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him. 
\v 33 And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house, he asked them, What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way? 
\v 34 But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among themselves, who \add should be\add* the greatest. 
\v 35 And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith to them, If any man desireth to be first, \add the same\add* shall be last of all, and servant of all. 
\v 36 And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when he had taken him in his arms, he said to them, 
\v 37 Whoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receiveth me: and whoever shall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me. 
\v 38 And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out demons in thy name, and he followeth not us; and we forbad him, because he followeth not us. 
\v 39 But Jesus said, Forbid him not; for there is no man who shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me. 
\v 40 For he that is not against us, is on our part. 
\v 41 For whoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say to you, he shall not lose his reward. 
\v 42 And whoever shall cause one of \add these\add* little ones that believe in me, to fall into sin, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea. 
\v 43 And if thy hand causeth thee to fall into sin, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched: 
\v 44 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. 
\v 45 And if thy foot causeth thee to fall into sin, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched: 
\v 46 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. 
\v 47 And if thy eye causeth thee to fall into sin, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes, to be cast into hell-fire. 
\v 48 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. 
\v 49 For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt. 
\v 50 Salt \add is\add* good: but if the salt hath lost its saltness, with what will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1 And he arose from thence, and cometh into the borders of Judea, by the further side of Jordan: and the people resort to him again; and, as he was accustomed, he taught them again. 
\v 2 And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away \add his\add* wife? tempting him. 
\v 3 And he answered and said to them, What did Moses command you? 
\v 4 And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put \add her\add* away. 
\v 5 And Jesus answered and said to them, For the hardness of your heart, he wrote you this precept. 
\v 6 But from the beginning of the creation, God made them male and female. 
\v 7 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife; 
\v 8 And they two shall be one flesh: so then they are no more two, but one flesh. 
\v 9 What therefore God hath joined together, let not man separate. 
\v 10 And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same \add matter\add* . 
\v 11 And he saith to them, Whoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her. 
\v 12 And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery. 
\v 13 And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them; and \add his\add* disciples rebuked those that brought \add them\add* . 
\v 14 But when Jesus saw \add it\add* , he was much displeased, and said to them, Suffer the little children to come to me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God. 
\v 15 Verily I say to you, Whoever shall not receive the kingdom of God, as a little child, he shall not enter it. 
\v 16 And he took them up in his arms, put \add his\add* hands upon them, and blessed them. 
\v 17 And when he had gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life? 
\v 18 And Jesus said to him, Why callest thou me good? \add there is\add* none good, but one, \add that is\add* God. 
\v 19 Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honor thy father and mother. 
\v 20 And he answered and said to him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth. 
\v 21 Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said to him, One thing thou lackest: go, sell whatever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, take up the cross, and follow me. 
\v 22 And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions. 
\v 23 And Jesus looked around, and saith to his disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God! 
\v 24 And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answereth again, and saith to them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God! 
\v 25 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. 
\v 26 And they were astonished beyond measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved? 
\v 27 And Jesus looking upon them, saith, With men \add it is\add* impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible. 
\v 28 Then Peter began to say to him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee. 
\v 29 Jesus answered and said, Verily I say to you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's, 
\v 30 But he shall receive a hundred-fold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come, eternal life. 
\v 31 But many \add that are\add* first shall be last; and the last first. 
\v 32 And they were in the way, going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen to him, 
\v 33  \add Saying\add* , Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man will be delivered to the chief priests, and to the scribes; and they will condemn him to death, and will deliver him to the Gentiles; 
\v 34 And they will mock him, and will scourge him, and will spit upon him, and will kill him: and the third day he will rise again. 
\v 35 And James and John the sons of Zebedee come to him, saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatever we shall desire. 
\v 36 And he said to them, What would ye that I should do for you? 
\v 37 They said to him, Grant to us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory. 
\v 38 But Jesus said to them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? 
\v 39 And they said to him, We can. And Jesus said to them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of: and with the baptism that I am baptized with shalt ye be baptized; 
\v 40 But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand, is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared. 
\v 41 And when the ten heard \add it\add* , they began to be much displeased with James and John. 
\v 42 But Jesus called them, and saith to them, Ye know that they who are accounted to rule over the Gentiles, exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them. 
\v 43 But so it shall not be among you: but whoever will be great among you, shall be your minister: 
\v 44 And whoever of you will be the chief, shall be servant of all. 
\v 45 For even the son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many. 
\v 46 And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples, and a great number of people, blind Bartimeus, the son of Timeus, sat by the highway-side begging. 
\v 47 And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, \add thou\add* son of David, have mercy on me. 
\v 48 And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, \add Thou\add* son of David, have mercy on me. 
\v 49 And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called: and they call the blind man, saying to him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee. 
\v 50 And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus. 
\v 51 And Jesus answered and said to him, What wilt thou that I should do to thee? The blind man said to him, Lord, that I may receive my sight. 
\v 52 And Jesus said to him, Go, thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, to Bethphage, and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples, 
\v 2 And saith to them, Go into the village over against you: and as soon as ye have entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied, on which never man sat; loose him, and bring \add him\add* . 
\v 3 And if any man shall say to you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord hath need of him; and immediately he will send him hither. 
\v 4 And they went, and found the colt tied by the door without, in a place where two ways met; and they loose him. 
\v 5 And certain of them that stood there, said to them, What do ye, loosing the colt? 
\v 6 And they said to them even as Jesus had commanded; and they let them go. 
\v 7 And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on him; and he sat upon him. 
\v 8 And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down branches off trees, and strewed \add them\add* in the way. 
\v 9 And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna: Blessed \add is\add* he that cometh in the name of the Lord. 
\v 10 Blessed \add be\add* the kingdom of our Father David, that cometh in the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest. 
\v 11 And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when he had looked round upon all things, it being now evening, he went out to Bethany, with the twelve. 
\v 12 And on the morrow, when they had come from Bethany, he was hungry, 
\v 13 And seeing a fig-tree afar off, having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing on it: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves: for the time of figs had not yet come. 
\v 14 And Jesus answered and said to it, Let no man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard \add it\add* . 
\v 15 And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of them that sold doves; 
\v 16 And would not suffer that any man should carry \add any\add* vessel through the temple. 
\v 17 And he taught, saying to them, Is it not written, My house shall be called by all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den of thieves. 
\v 18 And the scribes and chief priests heard \add it\add* , and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people were astonished at his doctrine. 
\v 19 And when evening had come, he went out of the city. 
\v 20 And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig-tree dried up from the roots. 
\v 21 And Peter calling to remembrance, saith to him, Master, behold, the fig-tree which thou cursedst is withered. 
\v 22 And Jesus answering, saith to them, Have faith in God. 
\v 23 For verily I say to you, that whoever shall say to this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that the things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatever he saith. 
\v 24 Therefore I say to you, Whatever things ye desire when ye pray, believe that ye receive \add them\add* , and ye shall have \add them\add* . 
\v 25 And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have aught against any: that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses. 
\v 26 But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your trespasses. 
\v 27 And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders, 
\v 28 And say to him, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority to do these things? 
\v 29 And Jesus answered and said to them, I will also ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things. 
\v 30 The baptism of John, was \add it\add* from heaven, or from men? answer me. 
\v 31 And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him? 
\v 32 But if we shall say, from men; they feared the people: for all \add men\add* counted John that he was a prophet indeed. 
\v 33 And they answered and said to Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus answering saith to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 And he began to speak to them by parables. A \add certain\add* man planted a vineyard, and set a hedge about \add it\add* , and digged \add a place for\add* the wine-vat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country. 
\v 2 And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard. 
\v 3 And they caught \add him\add* , and beat him and sent \add him\add* away empty. 
\v 4 And again, he sent to them another servant: and at him they cast stones, and wounded \add him\add* in the head, and sent \add him\add* away shamefully handled. 
\v 5 And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some. 
\v 6 Having yet therefore one son, his well-beloved, he sent him also last to them, saying, They will reverence my son. 
\v 7 But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours. 
\v 8 And they took him, and killed \add him\add* , and cast \add him\add* out of the vineyard. 
\v 9 What therefore will the Lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to others. 
\v 10 And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner: 
\v 11 This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes? 
\v 12 And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people; for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and departed. 
\v 13 And they sent to him certain of the Pharisees, and of the Herodians, to catch him in \add his\add* words. 
\v 14 And when they had come, they say to him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Cesar, or not? 
\v 15 Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see \add it\add* . 
\v 16 And they brought \add it\add* : and he saith to them, Whose \add is\add* this image and superscription? And they said to him, Cesar's. 
\v 17 And Jesus answering, said to them, Render to Cesar the things that are Cesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they wondered at him. 
\v 18 Then come to him the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying, 
\v 19 Master, Moses wrote to us, If a man's brother shall die, and leave \add his\add* wife, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise seed to his brother. 
\v 20 Now there were seven brothers: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed. 
\v 21 And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise. 
\v 22 And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also. 
\v 23 In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her for a wife. 
\v 24 And Jesus answering, said to them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God? 
\v 25 For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels who are in heaven. 
\v 26 And concerning the dead that they rise; have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spoke to him, saying, I \add am\add* the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? 
\v 27 He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err. 
\v 28 And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all? 
\v 29 And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments \add is\add* , Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord. 
\v 30 And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this \add is\add* the first commandment. 
\v 31 And the second \add is\add* like, \add namely\add* this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself: there is no other commandment greater than these. 
\v 32 And the scribe said to him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is no other but he. 
\v 33 And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love \add his\add* neighbor as himself, is more than all whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices. 
\v 34 And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said to him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question. 
\v 35 And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David? 
\v 36 For David himself said by the Holy Spirit, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thy enemies thy footstool. 
\v 37 David therefore himself calleth him Lord, and whence is he \add then\add* his son? and the common people heard him gladly. 
\v 38 And he said to them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, who love to go in long clothing, and \add love\add* salutations in the market-places, 
\v 39 And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts: 
\v 40 Who devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation. 
\v 41 And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much. 
\v 42 And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing. 
\v 43 And he called his disciples, and saith to them, Verily I say to you, that this poor widow hath cast in more, than all they who have cast into the treasury. 
\v 44 For all \add they\add* cast in of their abundance: but she of her want cast in all that she had, \add even\add* all her living. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 And as he was going out of the temple, one of his disciples saith to him, Master, see what manner of stones, and what buildings \add are here\add* ! 
\v 2 And Jesus answering said to him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down. 
\v 3 And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, over against the temple, Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, asked him privately, 
\v 4 Tell us, when will these things be? and what \add will be\add* the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled? 
\v 5 And Jesus answering them, began to say, Take heed lest any \add man\add* deceive you: 
\v 6 For many will come in my name, saying, I am \add Christ\add* ; and will deceive many. 
\v 7 And when ye shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars, be ye not troubled: for \add such things\add* must needs be; but the end \add will\add* not \add be\add* yet. 
\v 8 For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there will be earthquakes in \add divers\add* places, and there will be famines, and troubles: these \add are\add* the beginnings of sorrows. 
\v 9 But take heed to yourselves: for they will deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye will be beaten: and ye will be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them. 
\v 10 And the gospel must first be published among all nations. 
\v 11 But when they shall lead \add you\add* , and deliver you up, be not anxious beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Spirit. 
\v 12 Now the brother will betray the brother to death, and the father the son: and children will rise up against \add their\add* parents, and will cause them to be put to death. 
\v 13 And ye will be hated by all \add men\add* for my name's sake: but he that shall endure to the end, the same shall be saved. 
\v 14 But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand) then let them that are in Judea flee to the mountains: 
\v 15 And let him that is on the house-top not go down into the house, neither enter \add it\add* , to take any thing out of his house: 
\v 16 And let him that is in the field not turn back again to take up his garment. 
\v 17 But woe to them that are with child, and to them that nurse infants in those days. 
\v 18 And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter. 
\v 19 For \add in\add* those days shall be affliction, such as hath not been from the beginning of the creation which God created to this time, neither shall be. 
\v 20 And except the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh would be saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days. 
\v 21 And then, if any man shall say to you, Lo, here \add is\add* Christ; or lo, \add he is\add* there; believe \add him\add* not. 
\v 22 For false Christs, and false prophets will rise, and will show signs and wonders, to seduce, if \add it were\add* possible, even the elect. 
\v 23 But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things. 
\v 24 But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, 
\v 25 And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken. 
\v 26 And then they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory. 
\v 27 And then he will send his angels, and will assemble his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven. 
\v 28 Now learn a parable of the fig-tree: When its branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near: 
\v 29 So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know that it is nigh, \add even\add* at the doors. 
\v 30 Verily I say to you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things shall be done. 
\v 31 Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away. 
\v 32 But of that day and \add that\add* hour knoweth no man, no not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father. 
\v 33 Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is. 
\v 34  \add For the son of man is\add* as a man taking a long journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work; and commanded the porter to watch. 
\v 35 Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at evening, or at midnight, or at the cock-crowing, or in the morning: 
\v 36 Lest coming suddenly, he should find you sleeping. 
\v 37 And what I say to you, I say to all, Watch. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1 After two days was \add the feast of\add* the passover, and of unleavened bread: and the chief priests, and the scribes, sought how they might take him by craft, and put \add him\add* to death. 
\v 2 But they said, Not on the feast -\add day\add* , lest there should be an uproar of the people. 
\v 3 And being in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at table, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard, very precious; and she broke the box, and poured \add it\add* on his head. 
\v 4 And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made? 
\v 5 For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against her. 
\v 6 And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me. 
\v 7 For ye have the poor with you always, and whenever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always. 
\v 8 She hath done what she could: she is come beforehand to anoint my body to the burying. 
\v 9 Verily I say to you, Wherever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, \add this\add* also that she hath done shall be spoken of, for a memorial of her. 
\v 10 And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests, to betray him to them. 
\v 11 And when they heard \add it\add* , they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him. 
\v 12 And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said to him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare, that thou mayest eat the passover? 
\v 13 And he sendeth two of his disciples, and saith to them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him. 
\v 14 And wherever he shall go in, say ye to the master of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guest-chamber, where I may eat the passover with my disciples? 
\v 15 And he will show you a large upper room furnished \add and\add* prepared: there make ready for us. 
\v 16 And his disciples went, and came into the city, and found as he had said to them: and they made ready the passover. 
\v 17 And in the evening he cometh with the twelve. 
\v 18 And as they sat, and were eating, Jesus said, Verily I say to you, One of you who eateth with me, will betray me. 
\v 19 And they began to be sorrowful, and to say to him one by one, \add Is\add* it I? and another \add said\add* , \add Is\add* it I? 
\v 20 And he answered and said to them, \add It is\add* one of the twelve that dippeth with me in the dish. 
\v 21 The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written concerning him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born. 
\v 22 And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke \add it\add* , and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body. 
\v 23 And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave \add it\add* to them: and they all drank of it. 
\v 24 And he said to them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many. 
\v 25 Verily I say to you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God. 
\v 26 And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives. 
\v 27 And Jesus saith to them, All ye will be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered. 
\v 28 But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee. 
\v 29 But Peter said to him, Although all shall be offended, yet \add will\add* not I. 
\v 30 And Jesus saith to him, Verily I say to thee, that this day, \add even\add* in this night, before the cock shall crow twice, thou wilt deny me thrice. 
\v 31 But he spoke the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all. 
\v 32 And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray. 
\v 33 And he taketh with him Peter, and James, and John, and began to be greatly amazed, and to be very heavy; 
\v 34 And saith to them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful to death: tarry ye here, and watch. 
\v 35 And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, If it were possible, the hour might pass from him. 
\v 36 And he said, Abba, Father, all things \add are\add* possible to thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless, not what I will, but what thou wilt. 
\v 37 And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith to Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldst not thou watch one hour? 
\v 38 Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly \add is\add* ready, but the flesh \add is\add* weak. 
\v 39 And again he went away, and prayed, and spoke the same words. 
\v 40 And when he returned, he found them asleep again (for their eyes were heavy:) neither knew they what to answer him. 
\v 41 And he cometh the third time, and saith to them, Sleep on now, and take \add your\add* rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. 
\v 42 Rise, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand. 
\v 43 And immediately while he was yet speaking, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staffs, from the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders. 
\v 44 And he that betrayed him, had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead \add him\add* away safely. 
\v 45 And as soon as he was come, he goeth immediately to him, and saith, Master, master; and kissed him. 
\v 46 And they laid their hands on him, and took him. 
\v 47 And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear. 
\v 48 And Jesus answered and said to them, Have ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and \add with\add* staffs to take me? 
\v 49 I was daily with you in the temple, teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled. 
\v 50 And they all forsook him, and fled. 
\v 51 And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about \add his\add* naked \add body\add* ; and the young men laid hold on him. 
\v 52 And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked. 
\v 53 And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests, and the elders and the scribes. 
\v 54 And Peter followed him at a distance, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire. 
\v 55 And the chief priests, and all the council sought for testimony against Jesus to put him to death; and found none. 
\v 56 For many bore false testimony against him, but their testimony agreed not together. 
\v 57 And there arose certain, and bore false testimony against him, saying, 
\v 58 We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands. 
\v 59 But neither so did their testimony agree together. 
\v 60 And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these testify against thee? 
\v 61 But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said to him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed? 
\v 62 And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven. 
\v 63 Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses? 
\v 64 Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death. 
\v 65 And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say to him, Prophesy: and the servants struck him with the palms of their hands. 
\v 66 And as Peter was below in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest: 
\v 67 And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth. 
\v 68 But he denied, saying, I know not, neither do I understand what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crowed. 
\v 69 And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is \add one\add* of them. 
\v 70 And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art \add one\add* of them: for thou art a Galilean, and thy speech agreeth \add thereto\add* . 
\v 71 But he began to curse and to swear, \add saying\add* , I know not this man of whom ye speak. 
\v 72 And the second time the cock crowed. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said to him, Before the cock shall crow twice, thou wilt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1 And forthwith in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes, and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried \add him\add* away, and delivered \add him\add* to Pilate. 
\v 2 And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering, said to him, Thou sayest \add it\add* . 
\v 3 And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing. 
\v 4 And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they testify against thee. 
\v 5 But Jesus yet answered nothing: so that Pilate marveled. 
\v 6 Now at \add that\add* feast he released to them one prisoner, whom they desired. 
\v 7 And there was \add one\add* named Barabbas, \add who lay\add* bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection. 
\v 8 And the multitude crying aloud, began to desire \add him to do\add* as he had ever done to them. 
\v 9 But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release to you the King of the Jews? 
\v 10 (For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.) 
\v 11 But the chief priests moved the people that he should rather release Barabbas to them. 
\v 12 And Pilate answered, and said again to them, What will ye then that I shall do \add to him\add* whom ye call the King of the Jews? 
\v 13 And they cried out again, Crucify him. 
\v 14 Then Pilate said to them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him. 
\v 15 And \add so\add* Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas to them, and having scourged Jesus, delivered him to be crucified. 
\v 16 And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Pretorium; and they call together the whole band; 
\v 17 And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his \add head\add* , 
\v 18 And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews! 
\v 19 And they struck him on the head with a reed, and spit upon him, and bowing \add their\add* knees, worshiped him. 
\v 20 And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him. 
\v 21 And they constrain one Simon, a Cyrenian, who was passing by, coming from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross. 
\v 22 And they bring him to the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull. 
\v 23 And they gave him to drink, wine mingled with myrrh: but he received \add it\add* not. 
\v 24 And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take. 
\v 25 And it was the third hour, and they crucified him. 
\v 26 And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS. 
\v 27 And with him they crucify two thieves, the one on his right hand, and the other on his left. 
\v 28 And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors. 
\v 29 And they that passed by, railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest \add it\add* in three days, 
\v 30 Save thyself, and come down from the cross. 
\v 31 Likewise also the chief priests mocking, said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others, himself he cannot save. 
\v 32 Let Christ the king of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him, reviled him. 
\v 33 And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land, until the ninth hour. 
\v 34 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama, sabacthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? 
\v 35 And some of them that stood by, when they heard \add it\add* , said, Behold, he calleth Elijah. 
\v 36 And one ran and filled a sponge full of vinegar, and put \add it\add* on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down. 
\v 37 And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and expired. 
\v 38 And the vail of the temple was rent in two, from the top to the bottom. 
\v 39 And when the centurion who stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and expired, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God. 
\v 40 There were also women looking on at a distance, among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger, and of Joses, and Salome; 
\v 41 Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered to him; and many other women who came with him to Jerusalem. 
\v 42 And now, when the evening was come, (because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath) 
\v 43 Joseph of Arimathea, an honorable counselor, who also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly to Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus. 
\v 44 And Pilate wondered if he was already dead: and calling the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead. 
\v 45 And when he knew \add it\add* from the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph. 
\v 46 And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped \add him\add* in the linen, and laid him in a sepulcher which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone to the door of the sepulcher. 
\v 47 And Mary Magdalene and Mary \add the mother\add* of Joses, beheld where he was laid. 
\c 16  
\p
\v 1 And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the \add mother\add* of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him. 
\v 2 And very early in the morning, the first \add day\add* of the week, they came to the sepulcher at the rising of the sun: 
\v 3 And they said among themselves, Who shall roll away for us the stone from the door of the sepulcher? 
\v 4 (And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away) for it was very great. 
\v 5 And entering into the sepulcher, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were frightened. 
\v 6 And he saith to them, Be not frightened: ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him: 
\v 7 But go, tell his disciples and Peter, that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said to you. 
\v 8 And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulcher; for they trembled, and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any \add man\add* ; for they were afraid. 
\v 9 Now when \add Jesus\add* was risen early, the first \add day\add* of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven demons. 
\v 10  \add And\add* she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept. 
\v 11 And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen by her, believed not. 
\v 12 After that, he appeared in another form to two of them, as they were walking and going into the country. 
\v 13 And they went and told \add it\add* to the residue: neither believed they them. 
\v 14 Afterward he appeared to the eleven, as they sat at table, and upbraided them with their unbelief, and hardness of heart, because they believed not them who had seen him after he was risen. 
\v 15 And he said to them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. 
\v 16 He that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. 
\v 17 And these signs shall follow them that believe: In my name shall they cast out demons; they shall speak in new languages; 
\v 18 They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover. 
\v 19 So then after the Lord had spoken to them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God. 
\v 20 And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with \add them\add* , and confirming the word with signs following. Amen.
