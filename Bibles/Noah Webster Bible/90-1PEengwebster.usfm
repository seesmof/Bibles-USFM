\mt1 THE FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER 
\c 1  
\p
\v 1 Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, 
\v 2 Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, to obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you, and peace, be multiplied. 
\v 3 Blessed \add be\add* the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again to a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, 
\v 4 To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you, 
\v 5 Who are kept by the power of God through faith to salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. 
\v 6 In which ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season (if need be) ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations: 
\v 7 That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though tried with fire, might be found to praise, and honor, and glory, at the appearing of Jesus Christ: 
\v 8 Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see \add him\add* not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable, and full of glory: 
\v 9 Receiving the end of your faith, \add even\add* the salvation of \add your\add* souls. 
\v 10 Concerning which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace \add that should come\add* to you: 
\v 11 Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow. 
\v 12 To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us they ministered the things which are now reported to you by them that have preached the gospel to you, with the Holy Spirit sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into. 
\v 13 Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ; 
\v 14 As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance: 
\v 15 But as he who hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of deportment. 
\v 16 Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy. 
\v 17 And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning \add here\add* in fear: 
\v 18 Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, \add as\add* silver and gold, from your vain course of life \add received\add* by tradition from your fathers; 
\v 19 But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot: 
\v 20 Who verily was fore-ordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifested in these last times for you, 
\v 21 Who by him do believe in God, that raised him from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God. 
\v 22 Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit to unfeigned love of the brethren, \add see that ye\add* love one another with a pure heart fervently: 
\v 23 Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever. 
\v 24 For all flesh \add is\add* as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and its flower falleth away: 
\v 25 But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached to you. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 Wherefore, laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil-speakings, 
\v 2 As new-born babes, desire the pure milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby: 
\v 3 If indeed ye have tasted that the Lord \add is\add* gracious. 
\v 4 To whom coming \add as to\add* a living stone, disallowed indeed by men, but chosen by God, \add and\add* precious, 
\v 5 Ye also, as living stones, are built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. 
\v 6 Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner-stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded. 
\v 7 To you therefore who believe \add he is\add* precious: but to them who are disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner, 
\v 8 And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense, \add even to them\add* who stumble at the word, being disobedient: to which also they were appointed. 
\v 9 But ye \add are\add* a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light: 
\v 10 Who in time past \add were\add* not a people, but \add are\add* now the people of God: who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy. 
\v 11 Dearly beloved, I beseech \add you\add* as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul; 
\v 12 Having your manner of life honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evil-doers, they may by \add your\add* good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation. 
\v 13 Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether to the king, as supreme; 
\v 14 Or to governors, as to them that are sent by him for the punishment of evil-doers, and for the praise of them that do well. 
\v 15 For so is the will of God, that with well-doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men: 
\v 16 As free, and not using \add your\add* liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God. 
\v 17 Honor all \add men\add* . Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king. 
\v 18 Servants, \add be\add* subject to \add your\add* masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward. 
\v 19 For this \add is\add* thank-worthy, if a man for conscience towards God endureth grief, suffering wrongfully. 
\v 20 For what glory \add is it\add* , if, when ye are buffeted for your faults, ye bear it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer \add for it\add* , ye bear it patiently, this \add is\add* acceptable with God. 
\v 21 For even to this were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps: 
\v 22 Who committed no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: 
\v 23 Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed \add himself\add* to him that judgeth righteously: 
\v 24 Who himself bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live to righteousness; by whose stripes ye were healed. 
\v 25 For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned to the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 Likewise, ye wives, \add be\add* in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the deportment of the wives; 
\v 2 While they behold your chaste manner of life \add coupled\add* with fear. 
\v 3 Whose adorning let it not be that outward \add adorning\add* of plaiting the hair, and of wearing gold, or of putting on apparel; 
\v 4 But \add let it be\add* the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, \add even the ornament\add* of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price. 
\v 5 For after this manner in former times the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands: 
\v 6 Even as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement. 
\v 7 Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with \add them\add* according to knowledge, giving honor to the wife, as to the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered. 
\v 8 Finally, \add be ye\add* all of one mind, having compassion one of another; love as brethren, \add be\add* pitiful, \add be\add* courteous: 
\v 9 Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but on the contrary, blessing; knowing that ye are called to this, that ye should inherit a blessing. 
\v 10 For he that will love life, and see good days, let him restrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile: 
\v 11 Let him shun evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and pursue it. 
\v 12 For the eyes of the Lord \add are\add* over the righteous, and his ears \add are open\add* to their prayers: but the face of the Lord \add is\add* against them that do evil. 
\v 13 And who \add is\add* he that will harm you, if ye are followers of that which is good? 
\v 14 But if ye suffer for righteousness' sake, happy \add are ye\add* : and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled; 
\v 15 But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and \add be\add* ready always to \add give\add* an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear. 
\v 16 Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evil-doers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good deportment in Christ. 
\v 17 For \add it is\add* better, if the will of God is so, that ye suffer for well-doing, than for evil-doing. 
\v 18 For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but made alive by the Spirit: 
\v 19 By which also he went and preached to the spirits in prison; 
\v 20 Who formerly were disobedient, when once the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was preparing, in which few, that is, eight souls, were saved by water. 
\v 21 The like figure to which, \add even\add* baptism, doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience towards God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ: 
\v 22 Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels, and authorities, and powers being made subject to him. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin; 
\v 2 That he no longer should live the rest of \add his\add* time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God. 
\v 3 For the time past of \add our\add* life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revelings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries: 
\v 4 In which they think it strange that ye run not with \add them\add* to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of \add you\add* : 
\v 5 Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the living and the dead. 
\v 6 For, for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit. 
\v 7 But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch to prayer. 
\v 8 And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity will cover a multitude of sins. 
\v 9 Use hospitality one to another without grudging. 
\v 10 As every man hath received the gift, \add even so\add* minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God. 
\v 11 If any man speaketh \add let him speak\add* as the oracles of God; if any man ministereth \add let him do it\add* as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ; to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. 
\v 12 Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you: 
\v 13 But rejoice, seeing ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy. 
\v 14 If ye are reproached for the name of Christ, happy \add are ye\add* ; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you. On their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified. 
\v 15 But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or \add as\add* a thief, or \add as\add* an evil-doer, or as a busy-body in other men's matters. 
\v 16 Yet if \add any man suffereth\add* as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf. 
\v 17 For the time \add is come\add* that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if \add it\add* first \add beginneth\add* at us, what will \add be\add* the end of them that obey not the gospel of God? 
\v 18 And if the righteous is scarcely saved, where will the ungodly and the sinner appear? 
\v 19 Wherefore, let them that suffer according to the will of God, commit the keeping of their souls \add to him\add* in well-doing, as to a faithful Creator.

\v 1 The elders who are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed: 
\v 2 Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight \add of it\add* , not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but from a ready mind; 
\v 3 Neither as being lords over \add God's\add* heritage, but being examples to the flock. 
\v 4 And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away. 
\v 5 Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves to the elder. Yes, all \add of you\add* be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble. 
\v 6 Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time: 
\v 7 Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you. 
\v 8 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour: 
\v 9 Whom resist steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world. 
\v 10 But the God of all grace, who hath called us to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, establish, strengthen, settle \add you\add* . 
\v 11 To him \add be\add* glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. 
\v 12 By Silvanus, a faithful brother to you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God in which ye stand. 
\v 13 The \add church that is\add* at Babylon, elected together with \add you\add* , saluteth you; and \add so doth\add* Mark my son. 
\v 14 Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace \add be\add* with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.
