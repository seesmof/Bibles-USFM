\v 1 Now king David was old \add and\add* advanced in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he got no heat. 
\v 2 Wherefore his servants said to him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat. 
\v 3 So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the borders of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunamite, and brought her to the king. 
\v 4 And the damsel \add was\add* very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to him: but the king knew her not. 
\v 5 Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him. 
\v 6 And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he also \add was a\add* very goodly \add man\add* ; and \add his mother\add* bore him after Absalom. 
\v 7 And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah, helped \add him\add* . 
\v 8 But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men who \add belonged\add* to David, were not with Adonijah. 
\v 9 And Adonijah slew sheep, and oxen, and fat cattle, by the stone of Zoheleth, which \add is\add* by En-rogel, and called all his brethren the king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants: 
\v 10 But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not. 
\v 11 Wherefore Nathan spoke to Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth \add it\add* not? 
\v 12 Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thy own life, and the life of thy son Solomon. 
\v 13 Go, and enter in to king David, and say to him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear to thy handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign? 
\v 14 Behold, while thou art yet talking there with the king, I will also come in after thee, and confirm thy words. 
\v 15 And Bath-sheba went to the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunamite ministered to the king. 
\v 16 And Bath-sheba bowed, and did obeisance to the king. And the king said, What wouldst thou? 
\v 17 And she said to him, My lord, thou didst swear by the LORD thy God to thy handmaid, \add saying\add* , Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne. 
\v 18 And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest \add it\add* not: 
\v 19 And he hath slain oxen, and fat cattle, and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not called. 
\v 20 And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel \add are\add* upon thee, that thou shouldst tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him. 
\v 21 Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders. 
\v 22 And lo, while she was yet talking with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in. 
\v 23 And they told the king, saying, Behold, Nathan the prophet. And when he had come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground. 
\v 24 And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? 
\v 25 For he hath gone down this day, and hath slain oxen, and fat cattle, and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah. 
\v 26 But me, \add even\add* me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called. 
\v 27 Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shown \add it\add* to thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him? 
\v 28 Then king David answered and said, Call me Bath-sheba. And she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king. 
\v 29 And the king swore, and said, \add As\add* the LORD liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress, 
\v 30 Even as I swore to thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day. 
\v 31 Then Bath-sheba bowed with \add her\add* face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever. 
\v 32 And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king. 
\v 33 The king also said to them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon: 
\v 34 And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon. 
\v 35 Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah. 
\v 36 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so \add too\add* . 
\v 37 As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so let him be with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David. 
\v 38 So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon. 
\v 39 And Zadok the priest took a horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon. 
\v 40 And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them. 
\v 41 And Adonijah and all the guests that \add were\add* with him heard \add it\add* as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Why \add is this\add* noise of the city being in an uproar? 
\v 42 And while he yet spoke, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said to him, Come in; for thou \add art\add* a valiant man, and bringest good tidings. 
\v 43 And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king. 
\v 44 And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule: 
\v 45 And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they have come from thence rejoicing, so that the city resounded. This \add is\add* the noise that ye have heard. 
\v 46 And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom. 
\v 47 And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed. 
\v 48 And also thus said the king, Blessed \add be\add* the LORD God of Israel, who hath given \add one\add* to sit on my throne this day, my eyes even seeing \add it\add* . 
\v 49 And all the guests that \add were\add* with Adonijah were afraid, and arose, and went every man his way. 
\v 50 And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar. 
\v 51 And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear to me to-day that he will not slay his servant with the sword. 
\v 52 And Solomon said, If he will show himself a worthy man, there shall not a hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die. 
\v 53 So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said to him, Go to thy house. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying, 
\v 2 I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and show thyself a man; 
\v 3 And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself. 
\v 4 That the LORD may continue his word which he spoke concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel. 
\v 5 Moreover, thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, \add and\add* what he did to the two captains of the armies of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner, and to Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that \add was\add* about his loins, and in his shoes that \add were\add* on his feet. 
\v 6 Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoary head go down to the grave in peace. 
\v 7 But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother. 
\v 8 And behold, \add thou hast\add* with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjaminite of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I swore to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword. 
\v 9 Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou \add art\add* a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do to him; but his hoary head do thou bring down to the grave with blood. 
\v 10 So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David. 
\v 11 And the days that David reigned over Israel \add were\add* forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem. 
\v 12 Then Solomon was seated upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly. 
\v 13 And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? and he said, Peaceably. 
\v 14 He said moreover, I have somewhat to say to thee. And she said, Say on. 
\v 15 And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and \add that\add* all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: but the kingdom is turned about, and hath become my brother's: for it was his from the LORD. 
\v 16 And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said to him, Say on. 
\v 17 And he said, Speak, I pray thee, to Solomon the king, (for he will not say to thee no,) that he give me Abishag the Shunamite for a wife. 
\v 18 And Bath-sheba said, Well; I will speak for thee to the king. 
\v 19 Bath-sheba therefore went to king Solomon, to speak to him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself to her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand. 
\v 20 Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; \add I pray thee\add* , deny me not. And the king said to her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not deny thee. 
\v 21 And she said, Let Abishag the Shunamite be given to Adonijah thy brother for a wife. 
\v 22 And king Solomon answered and said to his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunamite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he \add is\add* my elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah. 
\v 23 Then king Solomon swore by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah hath not spoken this word against his own life. 
\v 24 Now therefore, \add as\add* the LORD liveth, who hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me a house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day. 
\v 25 And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died. 
\v 26 And to Abiathar the priest said the king, Depart to Anathoth, to thy own fields; for thou \add art\add* worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou didst bear the ark of the LORD God before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all in which my father was afflicted. 
\v 27 So Solomon removed Abiathar from being priest to the LORD; that he might fulfill the word of the LORD, which he spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh. 
\v 28 Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled to the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar. 
\v 29 And it was told to king Solomon that Joab had fled to the tabernacle of the LORD; and behold, \add he is\add* by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him. 
\v 30 And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said to him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, No; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me. 
\v 31 And the king said to him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father. 
\v 32 And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing \add of it\add* , \add to wit\add* , Abner the son of Ner captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah. 
\v 33 Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace forever from the LORD. 
\v 34 So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness. 
\v 35 And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the army: and Zadok the priest the king put in the room of Abiathar. 
\v 36 And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Build thee a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence to any place whatever. 
\v 37 For it shall be, \add that\add* on the day thou shalt go out, and pass over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thy own head. 
\v 38 And Shimei said to the king, The saying \add is\add* good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days. 
\v 39 And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away to Achish son of Maachah king of Gath: and they told Shimei, saying, behold, thy servants are in Gath. 
\v 40 And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went and brought his servants from Gath. 
\v 41 And it was told to Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and had returned. 
\v 42 And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protest to thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest any where abroad, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst to me, The word \add that\add* I have heard \add is\add* good. 
\v 43 Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged thee with? 
\v 44 The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thy heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the LORD will return thy wickedness upon thy own head; 
\v 45 And king Solomon \add shall be\add* blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD for ever. 
\v 46 So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; who went out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem on every side. 
\v 2 Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built to the name of the LORD, until those days. 
\v 3 And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places. 
\v 4 And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that \add was\add* the great high place: a thousand burnt-offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar. 
\v 5 In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and God said, Ask what I shall give thee. 
\v 6 And Solomon said, Thou hast shown to thy servant David my father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as \add it is\add* this day. 
\v 7 And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: and I \add am but\add* a little child: I know not how to go out or come in. 
\v 8 And thy servant \add is\add* in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude. 
\v 9 Give therefore to thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy so great a people? 
\v 10 And the speech pleased the LORD, that Solomon had asked this thing. 
\v 11 And God said to him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thy enemies: but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment; 
\v 12 Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there hath been none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like to thee. 
\v 13 And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and honor: so that there shall not be any among the kings like to thee all thy days, 
\v 14 And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy days. 
\v 15 And Solomon awoke; and behold, \add it was\add* a dream. And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and offered up burnt-offerings, and offered peace-offerings, and made a feast to all his servants. 
\v 16 Then came there two women, \add that were\add* harlots, to the king, and stood before him. 
\v 17 And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house. 
\v 18 And it came to pass the third day after I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we \add were\add* together; \add there was\add* no stranger with us in the house, save us two in the house. 
\v 19 And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid it. 
\v 20 And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thy handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom. 
\v 21 And when I rose in the morning to nurse my child, behold, it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, which I bore. 
\v 22 And the other woman said, No; but the living \add is\add* my son, and the dead \add is\add* thy son. And this said, No; but the dead \add is\add* thy son, and the living \add is\add* my son. Thus they spoke before the king. 
\v 23 Then said the king, The one saith, This \add is\add* my son that liveth, and thy son \add is\add* the dead; and the other saith, No; but thy son \add is\add* the dead, and my son \add is\add* the living. 
\v 24 And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king. 
\v 25 And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other. 
\v 26 Then spoke the woman whose the living child \add was\add* to the king, for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, \add but\add* divide \add it\add* . 
\v 27 Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she \add is\add* the mother of it. 
\v 28 And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God \add was\add* in him, to do judgment. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 So king Solomon was king over all Israel. 
\v 2 And these \add were\add* the princes which he had; Azariah the son of Zadok the priest, 
\v 3 Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehosaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder. 
\v 4 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada \add was\add* over the army: and Zadok and Abiathar \add were\add* the priests: 
\v 5 And Azariah the son of Nathan \add was\add* over the officers: and Zabud the son of Nathan \add was\add* principal officer, \add and\add* the king's friend: 
\v 6 And Ahishar \add was\add* over the household: and Adoniram the son of Abda \add was\add* over the tribute. 
\v 7 And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, who provided victuals for the king and his household: each man his month in a year made provision. 
\v 8 And these \add are\add* their names: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim: 
\v 9 The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan: 
\v 10 The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him \add pertained\add* Sochoh, and all the land of Hepher: 
\v 11 The son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; who had Taphath the daughter of Solomon for a wife: 
\v 12 Baana the son of Ahilud; \add to him pertained\add* Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth-shean, which \add is\add* by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah, \add even\add* to \add the place that is\add* beyond Jokneam: 
\v 13 The son of Geber, in Ramoth-gilead; to him \add pertained\add* the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which \add are\add* in Gilead; to him \add also pertained\add* the region of Argob, which \add is\add* in Bashan, sixty great cities with walls and brazen bars: 
\v 14 Ahinadab the son of Iddo \add had\add* Mahanaim: 
\v 15 Ahimaaz \add was\add* in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of Solomon for a wife: 
\v 16 Baanah the son of Hushai \add was\add* in Asher and in Aloth: 
\v 17 Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar: 
\v 18 Shimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin: 
\v 19 Geber the son of Uri \add was\add* in the country of Gilead, \add in\add* the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan; and \add he was\add* the only officer who \add was\add* in the land. 
\v 20 Judah and Israel \add were\add* many, as the sand which \add is\add* by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry. 
\v 21 And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life. 
\v 22 And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and sixty measures of meal. 
\v 23 Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and a hundred sheep, besides harts, and roebucks, and fallow-deer, and fatted fowls. 
\v 24 For he had dominion over all \add the region\add* on this side the river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side of the river: and he had peace on all sides around him. 
\v 25 And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig-tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon. 
\v 26 And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. 
\v 27 And those officers provided victuals for king Solomon, and for all that came to king Solomon's table, every man in his month: they lacked nothing. 
\v 28 Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries they brought to the place where \add the officers\add* were, every man according to his charge. 
\v 29 And God gave Solomon great wisdom and understanding, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that \add is\add* on the sea-shore. 
\v 30 And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt. 
\v 31 For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all the surrounding nations. 
\v 32 And he spoke three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five. 
\v 33 And he spoke of trees, from the cedar tree that \add is\add* in Lebanon even to the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spoke also of beasts, and of fowls, and of creeping animals, and of fishes. 
\v 34 And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, who had heard of his wisdom. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David. 
\v 2 And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying, 
\v 3 Thou knowest how that David my father could not build a house to the name of the LORD his God, for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet. 
\v 4 But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, \add so that there is\add* neither adversary nor evil occurrent. 
\v 5 And behold, I purpose to build a house to the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spoke to David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build a house to my name. 
\v 6 Now therefore command thou, that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and to thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that \add there is\add* not among us any that is skilled in hewing timber like the Sidonians. 
\v 7 And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed \add be\add* the LORD this day, who hath given to David a wise son over this great people. 
\v 8 And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for: \add and\add* I will perform all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir. 
\v 9 My servants shall bring \add them\add* down from Lebanon to the sea: and I will convey them by sea in floats to the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt receive \add them\add* : and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household. 
\v 10 So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees \add according to\add* all his desire. 
\v 11 And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat \add for\add* food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year. 
\v 12 And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together. 
\v 13 And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men. 
\v 14 And he sent them to Lebanon ten thousand a month by courses; a month they were in Lebanon, \add and\add* two months at home. And Adoniram \add was\add* over the levy. 
\v 15 And Solomon had seventy thousand that bore burdens, and eighty thousand hewers in the mountains; 
\v 16 Besides the chief of Solomon's officers who \add were\add* over the work, three thousand and three hundred, who ruled over the people that wrought in the work. 
\v 17 And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, \add and\add* hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house. 
\v 18 And Solomon's builders, and Hiram's builders did hew \add them\add* , and the stone-squarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel had come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month of Zif, which \add is\add* the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD. 
\v 2 And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length of it \add was\add* sixty cubits, and the breadth of it twenty \add cubits\add* , and the hight of it thirty cubits. 
\v 3 And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits \add was\add* the length of it, according to the breadth of the house; \add and\add* ten cubits \add was\add* the breadth of it, before the house. 
\v 4 And for the house he made windows of narrow lights. 
\v 5 And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, \add against\add* the walls of the house round about, \add both\add* of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about: 
\v 6 The nethermost chamber \add was\add* five cubits broad, and the middle \add was\add* six cubits broad, and the third \add was\add* seven cubits broad: for without \add in the wall\add* of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that \add the beams\add* should not be fastened in the walls of the house. 
\v 7 And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither; so that there was neither hammer nor ax \add nor\add* any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building. 
\v 8 The door for the middle chamber \add was\add* in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle \add chamber\add* , and out of the middle into the third; 
\v 9 So he built the house and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar. 
\v 10 And \add then\add* he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar. 
\v 11 And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying, 
\v 12  \add Concerning\add* this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with thee, which I spoke to David thy father: 
\v 13 And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel. 
\v 14 So Solomon built the house, and finished it. 
\v 15 And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the ceiling: \add and\add* he covered \add them\add* on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir. 
\v 16 And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built \add them\add* for it within, \add even\add* for the oracle, \add even\add* for the most holy \add place\add* . 
\v 17 And the house, that \add is\add* , the temple before it, was forty cubits \add long\add* . 
\v 18 And the cedar of the house within \add was\add* carved with knobs and open flowers: all \add was\add* cedar; there was no stone seen. 
\v 19 And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD. 
\v 20 And the oracle in the forepart \add was\add* twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the hight of it, and he overlaid it with pure gold; and \add so\add* covered the altar \add which was of\add* cedar. 
\v 21 So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold. 
\v 22 And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that \add was\add* by the oracle he overlaid with gold. 
\v 23 And within the oracle he made two cherubim \add of\add* olive tree, \add each\add* ten cubits high. 
\v 24 And five cubits \add was\add* the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing to the uttermost part of the other \add were\add* ten cubits. 
\v 25 And the other cherub \add was\add* ten cubits: both the cherubim \add were\add* of one measure and one size. 
\v 26 The hight of the one cherub \add was\add* ten cubits, and so \add was it\add* of the other cherub. 
\v 27 And he set the cherubim within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubim, so that the wing of the one touched the \add one\add* wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house. 
\v 28 And he overlaid the cherubim with gold. 
\v 29 And he carved all the walls of the house around with carved figures of cherubim, and palm trees, and open flowers, within and without. 
\v 30 And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without. 
\v 31 And for the entrance of the oracle he made doors \add of\add* olive tree: the lintel \add and\add* side-posts \add were\add* a fifth part \add of the wall\add* . 
\v 32 The two doors also \add were of\add* olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubim, and palm trees, and open flowers, and overlaid \add them\add* with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubim, and upon the palm trees. 
\v 33 So also he made for the door of the temple posts \add of\add* olive tree a fourth part \add of the wall\add* . 
\v 34 And the two doors \add were of\add* fir tree: the two leaves of the one door \add were\add* folding, and the two leaves of the other door \add were\add* folding. 
\v 35 And he carved \add thereon\add* cherubim, and palm trees, and open flowers; and covered \add them\add* with gold, fitted upon the carved work. 
\v 36 And he built the inner court with three rows of hewn stone, and a row of cedar beams. 
\v 37 In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in the month Zif: 
\v 38 And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul (which \add is\add* the eighth month) was the house finished throughout all its parts, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1 But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house. 
\v 2 He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; its length \add was\add* a hundred cubits, and its breadth fifty cubits, and its hight thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars. 
\v 3 And \add it was\add* covered with cedar above upon the beams, that \add lay\add* on forty-five pillars, fifteen \add in\add* a row. 
\v 4 And \add there were\add* windows in three rows, and light \add was\add* against light \add in\add* three ranks. 
\v 5 And all the doors and posts \add were\add* square, with the windows: and light \add was\add* against light \add in\add* three ranks. 
\v 6 And he made a porch of pillars; its length \add was\add* fifty cubits, and its breadth thirty cubits: and the porch \add was\add* before them: and the \add other\add* pillars and the thick beams \add were\add* before them. 
\v 7 Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, \add even\add* the porch of judgment: and \add it was\add* covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other. 
\v 8 And his house where he dwelt \add had\add* another court within the porch, \add which\add* was of the like work. Solomon made also a house for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had married, like to this porch. 
\v 9 All these \add were of\add* costly stones, according to the measures of hewn stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation to the coping, and \add so\add* on the outside towards the great court. 
\v 10 And the foundation \add was of\add* costly stones, even great stones; stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits. 
\v 11 And above \add were\add* costly stones, after the measures of hewn stones, and cedars. 
\v 12 And the great court around \add was\add* with three rows of hewn stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house. 
\v 13 And king Solomon sent and brought Hiram out of Tyre. 
\v 14 He \add was\add* a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father \add was\add* a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and ingenious to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work. 
\v 15 For he cast two pillars of brass, each of eighteen cubits high: and a line of twelve cubits did encompass each of them. 
\v 16 And he made two capitals \add of\add* molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the hight of the one capital \add was\add* five cubits, and the hight of the other capital \add was\add* five cubits: 
\v 17  \add And\add* nets of checker-work, and wreaths of chain-work, for the capitals which \add were\add* upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital. 
\v 18 And he made the pillars, and two rows around upon the one net-work, to cover the capitals that \add were\add* upon the top, with pomegranates: and so he did for the other capital. 
\v 19 And the capitals that \add were\add* upon the top of the pillars \add were\add* of lily-work in the porch, four cubits. 
\v 20 And the capitals upon the two pillars \add had pomegranates\add* also above, over against the belly which \add was\add* by the net-work: and the pomegranates \add were\add* two hundred in rows around upon the other capital. 
\v 21 And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called its name Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and called its name Boaz. 
\v 22 And upon the top of the pillars \add was\add* lily-work: so was the work of the pillars finished. 
\v 23 And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: \add it was\add* entirely round, and its hight \add was\add* five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits encompassed it. 
\v 24 And under the brim of it around \add there were\add* knobs compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea around: the knobs \add were\add* cast in two rows, when it was cast. 
\v 25 It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking towards the north, and three looking towards the west, and three looking towards the south, and three looking towards the east: and the sea \add was set\add* above upon them, and all their hinder parts \add were\add* inward. 
\v 26 And it \add was\add* a hand-breadth thick, and its brim was wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand baths. 
\v 27 And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits \add was\add* the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth of it, and three cubits the hight of it. 
\v 28 And the work of the bases \add was\add* in this \add manner\add* : They had borders, and the borders \add were\add* between the ledges: 
\v 29 And on the borders that \add were\add* between the ledges \add were\add* lions, oxen, and cherubim: and upon the ledges \add there was\add* a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen \add were\add* certain additions made of thin work. 
\v 30 And every base had four brazen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners of it had undersetters: under the laver \add were\add* undersetters molten, at the side of every addition. 
\v 31 And the mouth of it within the capital and above \add was\add* a cubit: but the mouth of it \add was\add* round \add after\add* the work of the base, a cubit and a half: and also upon the mouth of it \add were\add* gravings with their borders, foursquare, not round. 
\v 32 And under the borders \add were\add* four wheels; and the axletrees of the wheels \add were joined\add* to the base: and the hight of a wheel \add was\add* a cubit and half a cubit. 
\v 33 And the work of the wheels \add was\add* like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their fellies, and their spokes, \add were\add* all molten. 
\v 34 And \add there were\add* four undersetters to the four corners of one base: \add and\add* the undersetters \add were\add* of the very base itself. 
\v 35 And in the top of the base \add was there\add* a round compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base its ledges and its borders \add were\add* of the same. 
\v 36 For on the plates of its ledges, and on its borders, he graved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of every one, and additions around. 
\v 37 After this \add manner\add* he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, \add and\add* one size. 
\v 38 Then he made ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths: \add and\add* every laver was four cubits: \add and\add* upon every one of the ten bases one laver. 
\v 39 And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south. 
\v 40 And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he executed for king Solomon for the house of the LORD: 
\v 41 The two pillars, and the \add two\add* bowls of the capitals that \add were\add* on the top of the two pillars; and the two net-works, to cover the two bowls of the capitals which \add were\add* upon the top of the pillars; 
\v 42 And four hundred pomegranates for the two net-works, \add even\add* two rows of pomegranates for one net-work, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that \add were\add* upon the pillars; 
\v 43 And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases; 
\v 44 And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea; 
\v 45 And the pots, and the shovels, and the basins: and all these vessels which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the LORD, \add were of\add* bright brass. 
\v 46 In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan. 
\v 47 And Solomon left all the vessels \add unweighed\add* , because they were very numerous: neither was the weight of the brass ascertained. 
\v 48 And Solomon made all the vessels that \add pertained\add* to the house of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, upon which \add was\add* the show-bread, 
\v 49 And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right \add side\add* , and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs \add of\add* gold, 
\v 50 And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the censers \add of\add* pure gold; and the hinges \add of\add* gold, \add both\add* for the doors of the inner house, the most holy \add place\add* , \add and\add* for the doors of the house, \add to wit\add* , of the temple. 
\v 51 So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated; \add even\add* the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, he placed among the treasures of the house of the LORD. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1 Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, to king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which \add is\add* Zion. 
\v 2 And all the men of Israel assembled themselves to king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which \add is\add* the seventh month. 
\v 3 And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark. 
\v 4 And they brought the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that \add were\add* in the tabernacle, even those did the priests and the Levites bring. 
\v 5 And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled to him, \add were\add* with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude. 
\v 6 And the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy \add place\add* , \add even\add* under the wings of the cherubim. 
\v 7 For the cherubim spread forth \add their\add* two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the staffs thereof above. 
\v 8 And they drew out the staffs, that the ends of the staffs were seen out in the holy \add place\add* before the oracle, and they were not seen without: and there they are to this day. 
\v 9  \add There was\add* nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses deposited there at Horeb, when the LORD made \add a covenant\add* with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt. 
\v 10 And it came to pass, when the priests had come out of the holy \add place\add* , that the cloud filled the house of the LORD, 
\v 11 So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of the LORD. 
\v 12 Then spoke Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in the thick darkness. 
\v 13 I have surely built thee a house to dwell in, a settled place for thee to abide in for ever. 
\v 14 And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel were standing. 
\v 15 And he said, Blessed \add be\add* the LORD God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth to David my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled \add it\add* , saying, 
\v 16 Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel from Egypt, I have chosen no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house, that my name might be therein; but I chose David to be over my people Israel. 
\v 17 And it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the LORD God of Israel. 
\v 18 And the LORD said to David my father, Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house to my name, thou didst well that it was in thy heart. 
\v 19 Nevertheless, thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house to my name. 
\v 20 And the LORD hath performed his word that he spoke, and I have risen in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built a house for the name of the LORD God of Israel. 
\v 21 And I have set there a place for the ark, in which \add is\add* the covenant of the LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them from the land of Egypt. 
\v 22 And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands towards Heaven: 
\v 23 And he said, LORD God of Israel, \add there is\add* no God like thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart. 
\v 24 Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou didst promise him: thou didst speak also with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled \add it\add* with thy hand, as \add it is\add* this day. 
\v 25 Therefore now, LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou didst promise him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; provided thy children take heed to their way, that they walk before me as thou hast walked before me. 
\v 26 And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified, which thou didst speak to thy servant David my father. 
\v 27 But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have built? 
\v 28 Yet have thou respect to the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken to the cry and to the prayer, which thy servant prayeth before thee this day: 
\v 29 That thy eyes may be open towards this house night and day, \add even\add* towards the place of which thou hast said, My name shall be there: that thou mayest hearken to the prayer which thy servant shall make towards this place. 
\v 30 And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray towards this place: and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling-place: and when thou hearest, forgive. 
\v 31 If any man shall trespass against his neighbor, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thy altar in this house: 
\v 32 Then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness. 
\v 33 When thy people Israel shall be smitten before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to thee, and confess thy name, and pray, and make supplication to thee in this house: 
\v 34 Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again to the land which thou gavest to their fathers. 
\v 35 When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray towards this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou afflictest them: 
\v 36 Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, that thou mayest teach them the good way in which they should walk, and give rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance. 
\v 37 If there shall be in the land famine, if there shall be pestilence, blasting, mildew, locust, \add or\add* if there shall be caterpillar; if their enemy shall besiege them in the land of their cities, whatever plague, whatever sickness \add there shall be\add* ; 
\v 38 Whatever prayer and supplication shall be \add made\add* by any man, \add or\add* by all thy people Israel, who shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands towards this house: 
\v 39 Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling-place, and forgive, and do, and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou, \add even\add* thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men;) 
\v 40 That they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest to our fathers. 
\v 41 Moreover, concerning a stranger, that \add is\add* not of thy people Israel, but cometh out of a far country for thy name's sake; 
\v 42 (For they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong hand, and of thy out-stretched arm;) when he shall come and pray towards this house; 
\v 43 Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling-place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for: that all people of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as \add do\add* thy people Israel; and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name. 
\v 44 If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, whithersoever thou shalt send them, and shall pray to the LORD towards the city which thou hast chosen, and \add towards\add* the house that I have built for thy name: 
\v 45 Then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause. 
\v 46 If they shall sin against thee, (for \add there is\add* no man that sinneth not,) and thou shalt be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captives to the land of the enemy, far or near; 
\v 47  \add Yet\add* if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they were carried captives, and repent and make supplication to thee in the land of them that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed wickedness; 
\v 48 And \add so\add* return to thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies, who led them away captive, and pray to thee towards their land, which thou gavest to their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name: 
\v 49 Then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling-place, and maintain their cause, 
\v 50 And forgive thy people that have sinned against thee, and all their transgressions in which they have transgressed against thee, and give them compassion before them who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them: 
\v 51 For they \add are\add* thy people, and thy inheritance, which thou broughtest out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron: 
\v 52 That thy eyes may be open to the supplication of thy servant, and to the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken to them in all their supplications to thee. 
\v 53 For thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth, \add to be\add* thy inheritance, as thou didst speak by the hand of Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O LORD God. 
\v 54 And it was \add so\add* , that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication to the LORD, he arose from before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees, with his hands spread up to heaven. 
\v 55 And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying, 
\v 56 Blessed \add be\add* the LORD, that hath given rest to his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant. 
\v 57 The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us: 
\v 58 That he may incline our hearts to him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers. 
\v 59 And let these my words with which I have made supplication before the LORD, be nigh to the LORD our God day and night, that he may maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel at all times, as the matter shall require: 
\v 60 That all the people of the earth may know, that the LORD \add is\add* God, \add and that there is\add* none else. 
\v 61 Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day. 
\v 62 And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the LORD. 
\v 63 And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace-offerings, which he offered to the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD. 
\v 64 The same day did the king consecrate the middle of the court that \add was\add* before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt-offerings, and meat-offerings, and the fat of the peace-offerings: because the brazen altar that \add was\add* before the LORD \add was\add* too little to receive the burnt-offerings, and meat-offerings, and the fat of the peace-offerings. 
\v 65 And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entrance into Hamath to the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, \add even\add* fourteen days. 
\v 66 On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed the king, and went to their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had done for David his servant, and for Israel his people.

\v 1 And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and all Solomon's desire which he was pleased to perform, 
\v 2 That the LORD appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared to him at Gibeon. 
\v 3 And the LORD said to him, I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually. 
\v 4 And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, \add and\add* wilt keep my statutes and my judgments: 
\v 5 Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever, as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel. 
\v 6  \add But\add* if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your children, and will not keep my commandments \add and\add* my statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them: 
\v 7 Then will I cut off Israel from the land which I have given them; and this house which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a by-word among all people: 
\v 8 And at this house \add which\add* is high, every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why hath the LORD done thus to this land, and to this house? 
\v 9 And they shall answer, Because they forsook the LORD their God, who brought forth their fathers from the land of Egypt, and have taken hold upon other gods, and have worshiped them, and served them: therefore hath the LORD brought upon them all this evil. 
\v 10 And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD, and the king's house, 
\v 11 (\add Now\add* Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee. 
\v 12 And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they pleased him not. 
\v 13 And he said, What cities \add are\add* these which thou hast given me, my brother? And he called them the land of Cabul to this day. 
\v 14 And Hiram sent to the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold. 
\v 15 And this \add is\add* the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised, to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer. 
\v 16  \add For\add* Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it \add for\add* a present to his daughter, Solomon's wife. 
\v 17 And Solomon built Gezer, and Beth-horon the nether, 
\v 18 And Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land, 
\v 19 And all the cities of store that Solomon had, and cities for his chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion. 
\v 20  \add And\add* all the people \add that were\add* left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, who \add were\add* not of the children of Israel, 
\v 21 Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bond-service to this day. 
\v 22 But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bond-men: but they \add were\add* men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen. 
\v 23 These \add were\add* the chief of the officers that \add were\add* over Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, who bore rule over the people that wrought in the work. 
\v 24 But Pharaoh's daughter came up from the city of David to her house which \add Solomon\add* had built for her: then he built Millo. 
\v 25 And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt-offerings and peace-offerings upon the altar which he built to the LORD, and he burnt incense upon the altar that \add was\add* before the LORD. So he finished the house. 
\v 26 And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion-geber, which \add is\add* beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom. 
\v 27 And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon. 
\v 28 And they came to Ophir, and imported from thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought \add it\add* to king Solomon. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1 And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with hard questions. 
\v 2 And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bore spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when she had come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart. 
\v 3 And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not \add any\add* thing hid from the king, which he told her not. 
\v 4 And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom, and the house that he had built, 
\v 5 And the provisions of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cup-bearers, and his ascent by which he went up to the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her. 
\v 6 And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in my own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom. 
\v 7 Howbeit, I believed not the words, until I came, and my eyes had seen \add it\add* : and behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame which I heard. 
\v 8 Happy \add are\add* thy men, happy \add are\add* these thy servants, who stand continually before thee, \add and\add* that hear thy wisdom. 
\v 9 Blessed be the LORD thy God, who delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel: because the LORD loved Israel for ever, therefore he made thee king, to do judgment and justice. 
\v 10 And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices a very great quantity, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon. 
\v 11 And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and precious stones. 
\v 12 And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the LORD, and for the king's house, harps also and psalteries for singers: there came no such almug-trees, nor have they been seen to this day. 
\v 13 And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, besides \add that\add* which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants. 
\v 14 Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty six talents of gold, 
\v 15 Besides \add what he had\add* of the merchants, and of the traffic of the spice-merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country. 
\v 16 And king Solomon made two hundred targets \add of\add* beaten gold: six hundred \add shekels\add* of gold went to one target. 
\v 17 And \add he made\add* three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pounds of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon. 
\v 18 Moreover, the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold. 
\v 19 The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne \add was\add* round behind: and \add there were\add* stays on either side on the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays. 
\v 20 And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom. 
\v 21 And all king Solomon's drinking vessels \add were of\add* gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon \add were of\add* pure gold; none \add were of\add* silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon. 
\v 22 For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks. 
\v 23 So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom. 
\v 24 And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart. 
\v 25 And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year. 
\v 26 And Solomon collected chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem. 
\v 27 And the king made silver \add to be\add* in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars he made \add to be\add* as the sycamore trees that \add are\add* in the vale, for abundance. 
\v 28 And Solomon had horses brought from Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price. 
\v 29 And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred \add shekels\add* of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring \add them\add* out by their means. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 But king Solomon loved many foreign women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, \add and\add* Hittites; 
\v 2 Of the nations \add concerning\add* which the LORD said to the children of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in to you: \add for\add* surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: Solomon cleaved to these in love. 
\v 3 And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart. 
\v 4 For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, \add that\add* his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as \add was\add* the heart of David his father. 
\v 5 For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites. 
\v 6 And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not fully after the LORD, as \add did\add* David his father. 
\v 7 Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that \add is\add* before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon. 
\v 8 And likewise did he for all his foreign wives, who burnt incense and sacrificed to their gods. 
\v 9 And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned from the LORD God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice, 
\v 10 And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he kept not that which the LORD commanded. 
\v 11 Wherefore the LORD said to Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done by thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant. 
\v 12 Notwithstanding, in thy days, I will not do it, for David thy father's sake: \add but\add* I will rend it out of the hand of thy son. 
\v 13 Yet, I will not rend away all the kingdom; \add but\add* will give one tribe to thy son for David my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen. 
\v 14 And the LORD stirred up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he \add was\add* of the king's seed in Edom. 
\v 15 For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host had gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in Edom; 
\v 16 (For six months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until he had cut off every male in Edom:) 
\v 17 That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad \add being\add* yet a little child. 
\v 18 And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took men with them from Paran, and they came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt; who gave him a house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land. 
\v 19 And Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him for a wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen. 
\v 20 And the sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house: and Genubath was in Pharaoh's household among the sons of Pharaoh. 
\v 21 And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to my own country. 
\v 22 Then Pharaoh said to him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seekest to go to thy own country? And he answered, Nothing: yet, in any wise let me go. 
\v 23 And God stirred him up \add another\add* adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, who fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah: 
\v 24 And he gathered men to him, and became captain over a band, when David slew them \add of Zobah\add* : and they went to Damascus, and dwelt in it, and reigned in Damascus. 
\v 25 And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, besides the mischief that Hadad \add did\add* : and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria. 
\v 26 And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon's servant, whose mother's name \add was\add* Zeruah, a widow woman, even he raised \add his\add* hand against the king. 
\v 27 And this \add was\add* the cause why he raised \add his\add* hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, \add and\add* repaired the breaches of the city of David his father. 
\v 28 And the man Jeroboam \add was\add* a mighty man of valor: and Solomon, seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph. 
\v 29 And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two \add were\add* alone in the field: 
\v 30 And Ahijah caught the new garment that \add was\add* on him, and rent it \add in\add* twelve pieces: 
\v 31 And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom from the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee: 
\v 32 (But he shall have one tribe for my servant David's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel:) 
\v 33 Because they have forsaken me, and have worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do \add that which is\add* right in my eyes, and \add to keep\add* my statutes and my judgments, as \add did\add* David his father. 
\v 34 Yet I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant's sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes: 
\v 35 But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it to thee, \add even\add* ten tribes. 
\v 36 And to his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a light always before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen for me to put my name there. 
\v 37 And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel. 
\v 38 And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken to all that I command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do right in my sight, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with thee, and build thee a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel to thee. 
\v 39 And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever. 
\v 40 Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon. 
\v 41 And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, \add are\add* they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon? 
\v 42 And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel \add was\add* forty years. 
\v 43 And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king. 
\v 2 And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet in Egypt, heard \add of it\add* , (for he had fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;) 
\v 3 That they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came, and spoke to Rehoboam, saying, 
\v 4 Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee. 
\v 5 And he said to them, Depart yet \add for\add* three days, then come again to me. And the people departed. 
\v 6 And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that I may answer this people? 
\v 7 And they spoke to him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant to this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever. 
\v 8 But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that had grown up with him, \add and\add* who stood before him: 
\v 9 And he said to them, What counsel give ye that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter? 
\v 10 And the young men that had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, Thus shalt thou speak to this people who spoke to thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou \add it\add* lighter to us; thus shalt thou say to them, My little \add finger\add* shall be thicker than my father's loins. 
\v 11 And now whereas my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions. 
\v 12 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day. 
\v 13 And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old men's counsel that they gave him; 
\v 14 And spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke: my father \add also\add* chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions. 
\v 15 Wherefore the king hearkened not to the people; for the cause was from the LORD, that he might perform his saying, which the LORD spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat. 
\v 16 So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not to them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither \add have we\add* inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to thy own house, David. So Israel departed to their tents. 
\v 17 But \add as for\add* the children of Israel who dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them. 
\v 18 Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who \add was\add* over the tribute; and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king Rehoboam made speed to enter his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem. 
\v 19 So Israel rebelled against the house of David to this day. 
\v 20 And it came to pass when all Israel heard that Jeroboam had come again, that they sent and called him to the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only. 
\v 21 And when Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand chosen men, who were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon. 
\v 22 But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying, 
\v 23 Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying, 
\v 24 Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to the word of the LORD, and returned to depart, according to the word of the LORD. 
\v 25 Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt in it, and went out from thence, and built Penuel. 
\v 26 And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David: 
\v 27 If this people go up to perform sacrifice in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again to their lord, \add even\add* to Rehoboam king of Judah, and they shall kill me, and return to Rehoboam king of Judah. 
\v 28 Upon which the king took counsel, and made two calves \add of\add* gold, and said to them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt. 
\v 29 And he set the one in Beth-el, and the other he placed in Dan. 
\v 30 And this thing became a sin: for the people went \add to worship\add* before the one, \add even\add* to Dan. 
\v 31 And he made a house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, who were not of the sons of Levi. 
\v 32 And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like the feast that \add is\add* in Judah, and he offered upon the altar. So did he in Beth-el, sacrificing to the calves that he had made: and he placed in Beth-el the priests of the high places which he had made. 
\v 33 So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Beth-el the fifteenth day of the eighth month, \add even\add* in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast to the children of Israel: and he offered upon the altar, and burnt incense. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 And behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the LORD to Beth-el: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense. 
\v 2 And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and said, O altar, altar, thus saith the LORD; Behold, a child shall be born to the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men's bones shall be burnt upon thee. 
\v 3 And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This \add is\add* the sign which the LORD hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that \add are\add* upon it shall be poured out. 
\v 4 And it came to pass when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God, who had cried against the altar in Beth-el, that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not draw it to him again. 
\v 5 The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the LORD. 
\v 6 And the king answered and said to the man of God, Entreat now the face of the LORD thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored to me again. And the man of God besought the LORD, and the king's hand was restored to him again, and became as \add it was\add* before. 
\v 7 And the king said to the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward. 
\v 8 And the man of God said to the king, If thou wilt give me half thy house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place: 
\v 9 For so was it charged me by the word of the LORD, saying, Eat no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that thou camest. 
\v 10 So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Beth-el. 
\v 11 Now there dwelt an old prophet in Beth-el; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Beth-el: the words which he had spoken to the king, them they told also to their father. 
\v 12 And their father said to them, What way went he? for his sons had seen what way the man of God went, who came from Judah. 
\v 13 And he said to his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him the ass: and he rode upon it. 
\v 14 And went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak: and he said to him, \add Art\add* thou the man of God that camest from Judah? And he said, I \add am\add* . 
\v 15 Then he said to him, Come home with me, and eat bread. 
\v 16 And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee: neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place: 
\v 17 For it was said to me by the word of the LORD, Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest. 
\v 18 He said to him, I \add am\add* a prophet also as thou \add art\add* ; and an angel spoke to me by the word of the LORD, saying, Bring him back with thee into thy house, that he may eat bread and drink water. \add But\add* he lied to him. 
\v 19 So he went back with him, and ate bread in his house, and drank water. 
\v 20 And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of the LORD came to the prophet that brought him back: 
\v 21 And he cried to the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the LORD, and hast not kept the commandment which the LORD thy God commanded thee, 
\v 22 But hast returned, and hast eaten bread and drank water in the place, of which \add the LORD\add* said to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no water; thy carcass shall not come to the sepulcher of thy fathers. 
\v 23 And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drank, that he saddled for him the ass, \add to wit\add* , for the prophet whom he had brought back. 
\v 24 And when he had gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him: and his carcass was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion also stood by the carcass. 
\v 25 And behold, men passed by, and saw the carcass cast in the way, and the lion standing by the carcass: and they came and told \add it\add* in the city where the old prophet dwelt. 
\v 26 And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard \add of it\add* , he said, It \add is\add* the man of God, who was disobedient to the word of the LORD: therefore the LORD hath delivered him to the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke to him. 
\v 27 And he spoke to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they saddled \add him\add* . 
\v 28 And he went and found his carcass cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the carcass: the lion had not eaten the carcass, nor torn the ass. 
\v 29 And the prophet took up the carcass of the man of God, and laid it upon the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet came to the city, to mourn and to bury him. 
\v 30 And he laid his carcass in his own grave; and they mourned over him, \add saying\add* , Alas, my brother! 
\v 31 And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spoke to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulcher in which the man of God \add is\add* buried; lay my bones beside his bones: 
\v 32 For the saying which he cried by the word of the LORD against the altar in Beth-el, and against all the houses of the high places which \add are\add* in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass. 
\v 33 After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places: whoever would, he consecrated him, and he became \add one\add* of the priests of the high places. 
\v 34 And this thing became sin to the house of Jeroboam, even to cut \add it off\add* , and to destroy \add it\add* from the face of the earth. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1 At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick. 
\v 2 And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself, that thou mayest not be known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and go to Shiloh: behold, there \add is\add* Ahijah the prophet, who told me that \add I should be\add* king over this people. 
\v 3 And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of honey, and go to him: he will tell thee what shall become of the child. 
\v 4 And Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age. 
\v 5 And the LORD said to Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son; for he \add is\add* sick: thus and thus shalt thou say to her: for it shall be, when she cometh in, that she will feign herself \add to be\add* another \add woman\add* . 
\v 6 And it was \add so\add* , when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; why feignest thou thyself \add to be\add* another? for I \add am\add* sent to thee \add with\add* heavy \add tidings\add* . 
\v 7 Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my people Israel, 
\v 8 And rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it to thee: and \add yet\add* thou hast not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do \add that\add* only \add which was\add* right in my eyes; 
\v 9 But hast done evil above all that were before thee: for thou hast gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back: 
\v 10 Therefore behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam the males, \add and\add* him that is shut up and left in Israel, and will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as a man taketh away dung, till it is all gone. 
\v 11 Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat: for the LORD hath spoken \add it\add* . 
\v 12 Arise thou therefore, depart to thy own house: \add and\add* when thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die. 
\v 13 And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found \add some\add* good thing towards the LORD God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam. 
\v 14 Moreover, the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now. 
\v 15 For the LORD will smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water, and he will root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and will scatter them beyond the river, because they have made their groves, provoking the LORD to anger. 
\v 16 And he will give up Israel because of the sins of Jeroboam, who sinned, and who made Israel to sin. 
\v 17 And Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: \add and\add* when she came to the threshhold of the door, the child died; 
\v 18 And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by the hand of his servant Ahijah the prophet. 
\v 19 And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they \add are\add* written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. 
\v 20 And the days which Jeroboam reigned \add were\add* two and twenty years: and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead. 
\v 21 And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam \add was\add* forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD chose out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name \add was\add* Naamah an Ammonitess. 
\v 22 And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed, above all that their fathers had done. 
\v 23 For they also built for themselves high places, and images and groves, on every high hill, and under every green tree. 
\v 24 And there were also sodomites in the land: \add and\add* they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD cast out before the children of Israel. 
\v 25 And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, \add that\add* Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem: 
\v 26 And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he even took away all; and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made. 
\v 27 And king Rehoboam made in their stead brazen shields, and committed \add them\add* to the hands of the chief of the guard, who kept the door of the king's house. 
\v 28 And it was \add so\add* , when the king went into the house of the LORD, that the guard bore them, and brought them back into the guard chamber. 
\v 29 Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, \add are\add* they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
\v 30 And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all \add their\add* days. 
\v 31 And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And his mother's name \add was\add* Naamah an Ammonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his stead. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1 Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat reigned Abijam over Judah. 
\v 2 Three years he reigned in Jerusalem. And his mother's name \add was\add* Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom. 
\v 3 And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father. 
\v 4 Nevertheless, for David's sake the LORD his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem: 
\v 5 Because David did \add that which was\add* right in the eyes of the LORD, and turned not aside from any \add thing\add* that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite. 
\v 6 And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life. 
\v 7 Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, \add are\add* they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam. 
\v 8 And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. 
\v 9 And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa over Judah. 
\v 10 And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name \add was\add* Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom. 
\v 11 And Asa did \add that which was\add* right in the eyes of the LORD, as \add did\add* David his father. 
\v 12 And he banished the sodomites from the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made. 
\v 13 And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from \add being\add* queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed her idol, and burnt \add it\add* by the brook Kidron. 
\v 14 But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa's heart was perfect with the LORD all his days. 
\v 15 And he brought the things which his father had dedicated, and the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the LORD, silver, and gold, and vessels. 
\v 16 And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days. 
\v 17 And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah. 
\v 18 Then Asa took all the silver and the gold \add that were\add* left in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants: and king Asa sent them to Ben-hadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying, 
\v 19  \add There is\add* a league between me and thee, \add and\add* between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent to thee a present of silver and gold; come and break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me. 
\v 20 So Ben-hadad hearkened to king Asa, and sent the captains of the armies which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-beth-maachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali. 
\v 21 And it came to pass, when Baasha heard \add of it\add* , that he left off building of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah. 
\v 22 Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none \add was\add* exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and its timber, with which Baasha had built it; and king Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah. 
\v 23 The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, \add are\add* they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet. 
\v 24 And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead. 
\v 25 And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel two years. 
\v 26 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin. 
\v 27 And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which \add belonged\add* to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon. 
\v 28 Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him, and reigned in his stead. 
\v 29 And it came to pass, when he reigned, \add that\add* he smote all the house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the LORD, which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite: 
\v 30 Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made Israel sin, by his provocation with which he provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger. 
\v 31 Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, \add are\add* they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
\v 32 And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days. 
\v 33 In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty and four years. 
\v 34 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin. 
\c 16  
\p
\v 1 Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying, 
\v 2 Forasmuch as I exalted thee from the dust, and made thee prince over my people Israel; and thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam, and hast made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins; 
\v 3 Behold, I will take away the posterity of Baasha, and the posterity of his house; and will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat. 
\v 4 Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat. 
\v 5 Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might, \add are\add* they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
\v 6 So Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah: and Elah his son reigned in his stead. 
\v 7 And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the word of the LORD against Baasha, and against his house, even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD, in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam; and because he killed him. 
\v 8 In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years. 
\v 9 And his servant Zimri, captain of half \add his\add* chariots, conspired against him, as he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza steward of \add his\add* house in Tirzah. 
\v 10 And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead. 
\v 11 And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, \add that\add* he slew all the house of Baasha: he left him not one male, neither of his kinsman, nor of his friends. 
\v 12 Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke against Baasha, by Jehu the prophet, 
\v 13 For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by which they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities. 
\v 14 Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, \add are\add* they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
\v 15 In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah. And the people \add were\add* encamped against Gibbethon, which \add belonged\add* to the Philistines. 
\v 16 And the people \add that were\add* encamped heard it said, Zimri hath conspired, and hath also slain the king: wherefore all Israel made Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp. 
\v 17 And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah. 
\v 18 And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the palace of the king's house, and burnt the king's house over him with fire, and died, 
\v 19 For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the LORD, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin. 
\v 20 Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he wrought, \add are\add* they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
\v 21 Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri. 
\v 22 But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned. 
\v 23 In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah. 
\v 24 And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria. 
\v 25 But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse than all that \add were\add* before him. 
\v 26 For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin, to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities. 
\v 27 Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he showed, \add are\add* they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
\v 28 So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria: and Ahab his son reigned in his stead. 
\v 29 And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years. 
\v 30 And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD above all that \add were\add* before him. 
\v 31 And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshiped him. 
\v 32 And he erected an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria. 
\v 33 And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him. 
\v 34 In his days Hiel the Beth-elite built Jericho: he laid the foundation of it in Abiram his first-born, and set up the gates of it in his youngest \add son\add* Segub, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by Joshua the son of Nun. 
\c 17  
\p
\v 1 And Elijah the Tishbite \add who was\add* of the inhabitants of Gilead, said to Ahab, \add As\add* the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word. 
\v 2 And the word of the LORD came to him, saying, 
\v 3 Depart hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that \add is\add* before Jordan. 
\v 4 And it shall be, \add that\add* thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there. 
\v 5 So he went and did according to the word of the LORD: for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that \add is\add* before Jordan. 
\v 6 And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook. 
\v 7 And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land. 
\v 8 And the word of the LORD came to him, saying, 
\v 9 Arise, go to Zarephath, which \add belongeth\add* to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee. 
\v 10 So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman \add was\add* there gathering sticks: and he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink. 
\v 11 And as she was going to bring \add it\add* , he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thy hand. 
\v 12 And she said, \add As\add* the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but a handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and behold, I \add am\add* gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die. 
\v 13 And Elijah said to her, Fear not; go \add and\add* do as thou hast said: but make me of it a little cake first, and bring \add it\add* to me, and afterward make for thee and for thy son. 
\v 14 For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day \add that\add* the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth. 
\v 15 And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat \add many\add* days. 
\v 16  \add And\add* the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by Elijah. 
\v 17 And it came to pass after these things \add that\add* the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so severe, that there was no breath left in him. 
\v 18 And she said to Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come to me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son? 
\v 19 And he said to her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed. 
\v 20 And he cried to the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son? 
\v 21 And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried to the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this child's soul come into him again. 
\v 22 And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived. 
\v 23 And Elijah took the child, and brought him down from the chamber into the house, and delivered him to his mother: and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth. 
\v 24 And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou \add art\add* a man of God, \add and\add* that the word of the LORD in thy mouth \add is\add* truth. 
\c 18  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass \add after\add* many days, that the word of the LORD came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, show thyself to Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth. 
\v 2 And Elijah went to show himself to Ahab. And \add there was\add* a grievous famine in Samaria. 
\v 3 And Ahab called Obadiah who \add was\add* the governor of \add his\add* house. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly: 
\v 4 For it was \add so\add* , when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took a hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.) 
\v 5 And Ahab said to Obadiah, Go into the land, to all fountains of water, and to all brooks: it may be we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts. 
\v 6 So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself. 
\v 7 And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, \add Art\add* thou that my lord Elijah? 
\v 8 And he answered him, I \add am\add* : go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah \add is here\add* . 
\v 9 And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab to slay me? 
\v 10  \add As\add* the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation nor kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, \add He is\add* not \add there\add* ; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not. 
\v 11 And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah \add is here\add* . 
\v 12 And it will come to pass, \add as soon as\add* I have gone from thee, that the Spirit of the LORD will carry thee whither I know not; and \add so\add* when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he will slay me: but I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth. 
\v 13 Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid a hundred men of the LORD'S prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water? 
\v 14 And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah \add is here\add* : and he will slay me. 
\v 15 And Elijah said, \add As\add* the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself to him to-day. 
\v 16 So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah. 
\v 17 And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to him, \add Art\add* thou he that troubleth Israel? 
\v 18 And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim. 
\v 19 Now therefore send, \add and\add* gather to me all Israel to mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, who eat at Jezebel's table. 
\v 20 So Ahab sent to all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets to mount Carmel. 
\v 21 And Elijah came to all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the LORD \add is\add* God, follow him: but if Baal, \add then\add* follow him. And the people answered him not a word. 
\v 22 Then said Elijah to the people, I \add even\add* I only, remain a prophet of the LORD; but Baal's prophet's \add are\add* four hundred and fifty men. 
\v 23 Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay \add it\add* on wood, and put no fire \add under\add* : and I will dress the other bullock, and lay \add it\add* on wood, and put no fire \add under\add* : 
\v 24 And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken. 
\v 25 And Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress \add it\add* first; for ye \add are\add* many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire \add under\add* . 
\v 26 And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed \add it\add* , and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But \add there was\add* no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made. 
\v 27 And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he \add is\add* a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is on a journey, \add or\add* perhaps he sleepeth, and must be awaked. 
\v 28 And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them. 
\v 29 And it came to pass, when mid-day was past, and they prophesied until the \add time\add* of the offering of the \add evening\add* sacrifice, that \add there was\add* neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded. 
\v 30 And Elijah said to all the people, Come near to me. And all the people came near to him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD \add that was\add* broken down. 
\v 31 And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD came, saying, Israel shall be thy name: 
\v 32 And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed. 
\v 33 And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid \add him\add* on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour \add it\add* on the burnt-sacrifice, and on the wood. 
\v 34 And he said, Do \add it\add* the second time. And they did \add it\add* the second time. And he said, Do \add it\add* the third time. And they did \add it\add* the third time. 
\v 35 And the water ran around the altar; and he filled the trench also with water. 
\v 36 And it came to pass at \add the time of\add* the offering of the \add evening\add* sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou \add art\add* God in Israel, and \add that\add* I \add am\add* thy servant, and \add that\add* I have done all these things at thy word. 
\v 37 Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou \add art\add* the LORD God, and \add that\add* thou hast turned their heart back again. 
\v 38 Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt-sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that \add was\add* in the trench. 
\v 39 And when all the people saw \add it\add* , they fell on their faces: and they said, The LORD, he \add is\add* the God; the LORD, he \add is\add* the God. 
\v 40 And Elijah said to them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there. 
\v 41 And Elijah said to Ahab, Go up, eat and drink; for \add there is\add* a sound of abundance of rain. 
\v 42 So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees, 
\v 43 And said to his servant, Go up now, look towards the sea. And he went up and looked, and said, \add There is\add* nothing. And he said, Go again seven times. 
\v 44 And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand. And he said, Go up, say to Ahab, Prepare \add thy chariot\add* , and go down, that the rain may not hinder thee. 
\v 45 And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel. 
\v 46 And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel. 
\c 19  
\p
\v 1 And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and how he had slain all the prophets with the sword. 
\v 2 Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, So let the gods do \add to me\add* , and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to-morrow about this time. 
\v 3 And when he saw \add that\add* , he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beer-sheba, which \add belongeth\add* to Judah, and left his servant there. 
\v 4 But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper-tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I \add am\add* not better than my fathers. 
\v 5 And as he lay and slept under a juniper-tree, behold, then an angel touched him, and said to him, Arise \add and\add* eat. 
\v 6 And he looked, and behold, \add there was\add* a cake baked on the coals, and a cruse of water at his head. And he ate and drank, and laid himself down again. 
\v 7 And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise \add and\add* eat, because the journey \add is\add* too great for thee. 
\v 8 And he arose, and ate and drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb the mount of God. 
\v 9 And he came thither to a cave, and lodged there; and behold, the word of the LORD \add came\add* to him, and he said to him, What doest thou here, Elijah? 
\v 10 And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thy altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, I only, am left; and they seek my life to take it away. 
\v 11 And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD. And behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and broke in pieces the rocks before the LORD; \add but\add* the LORD \add was\add* not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; \add but\add* the LORD \add was\add* not in the earthquake: 
\v 12 And after the earthquake a fire; \add but\add* the LORD \add was\add* not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice. 
\v 13 And it was \add so\add* , when Elijah heard \add it\add* , that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entrance of the cave. And behold, \add there came\add* a voice to him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah? 
\v 14 And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thy altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away. 
\v 15 And the LORD said to him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael \add to be\add* king over Syria: 
\v 16 And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint \add to be\add* king over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah shalt thou anoint \add to be\add* prophet in thy room. 
\v 17 And it shall come to pass, \add that\add* him that escapeth the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay. 
\v 18 Yet I have left to \add me\add* seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him. 
\v 19 So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who \add was\add* plowing \add with\add* twelve yoke \add of oxen\add* before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon him. 
\v 20 And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and \add then\add* I will follow thee. And he said to him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee? 
\v 21 And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave to the people, and they ate. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered to him. 
\c 20  
\p
\v 1 And Ben-hadad the king of Syria collected all his army: and \add there were\add* thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and chariots: and he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred against it. 
\v 2 And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city, and said to him, Thus saith Ben-hadad, 
\v 3 Thy silver and thy gold \add is\add* mine; thy wives also and thy children, \add even\add* the most comely, \add are\add* mine. 
\v 4 And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king, according to thy saying, I \add am\add* thine, and all that I have. 
\v 5 And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Ben-hadad, saying, Although I have sent to thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver to me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children; 
\v 6 Yet I will send my servants to thee to-morrow about this time, and they shall search thy house, and the houses of thy servants; and it shall be, \add that\add* whatever is pleasant in thy eyes, they shall take \add it\add* in their hand, and carry \add it\add* away. 
\v 7 Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this \add man\add* seeketh mischief: for he sent to me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold, and I denied him not. 
\v 8 And all the elders and all the people said to him, Hearken not \add to him\add* , nor consent. 
\v 9 Wherefore he said to the messengers of Ben-hadad, Tell my lord the king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first, I will do: but this thing I may not do. And the messengers departed, and brought him word again. 
\v 10 And Ben-hadad sent to him, and said, The gods do so to me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me. 
\v 11 And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell \add him\add* , Let not him that girdeth on \add his harness\add* boast himself as he that putteth it off. 
\v 12 And it came to pass, when \add Ben-hadad\add* heard this message as he \add was\add* drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said to his servants, Set \add yourselves in array\add* . And they set \add themselves in array\add* against the city. 
\v 13 And behold, there came a prophet to Ahab king of Israel, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou seen all this great multitude? behold, I will deliver it into thy hand this day; and thou shalt know that I \add am\add* the LORD. 
\v 14 And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith the LORD, \add Even\add* by the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he said, Who shall order the battle? And he answered, Thou. 
\v 15 Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty two: and after them he numbered all the people, \add even\add* all the children of Israel, \add being\add* seven thousand. 
\v 16 And they went out at noon. But Ben-hadad \add was\add* drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings that helped him. 
\v 17 And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Ben-hadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men come out of Samaria. 
\v 18 And he said, Whether they have come out for peace, take them alive; or whether they have come out for war, take them alive. 
\v 19 So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city, and the army which followed them. 
\v 20 And they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; and Israel pursued them: and Ben-hadad the king of Syria escaped on a horse with the horsemen. 
\v 21 And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter. 
\v 22 And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said to him, Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest: for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee. 
\v 23 And the servants of the king of Syria said to him, Their gods \add are\add* gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. 
\v 24 And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their rooms: 
\v 25 And number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot: and we will fight against them in the plain, \add and\add* surely we shall be stronger than they. And he hearkened to their voice, and did so. 
\v 26 And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Ben-hadad numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel. 
\v 27 And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all present, and went against them: and the children of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country. 
\v 28 And there came a man of God, and spoke to the king of Israel, and said, Thus saith the LORD, Because the Syrians have said, The LORD \add is\add* God of the hills, but he \add is\add* not God of the valleys, therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thy hand, and ye shall know that I \add am\add* the LORD. 
\v 29 And they encamped one over against the other seven days. And \add so\add* it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians a hundred thousand footmen in one day. 
\v 30 But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and \add there\add* a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men \add that were\add* left. And Ben-hadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber. 
\v 31 And his servants said to him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel \add are\add* merciful kings: let us, I pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel: it may be he will save thy life. 
\v 32 So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and \add put\add* ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Ben-hadad saith, I pray thee, let me live. And he said, \add Is\add* he yet alive? he \add is\add* my brother. 
\v 33 Now the men diligently observed whether \add any thing would come\add* from him, and did hastily catch \add it\add* : and they said, Thy brother Ben-hadad. Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then Ben-hadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot. 
\v 34 And \add Ben-hadad\add* said to him, The cities, which my father took from thy father, I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then \add said Ahab\add* , I will send thee away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away. 
\v 35 And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his neighbor in the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man refused to smite him. 
\v 36 Then said he to him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as thou hast departed from me, a lion will slay thee. And as soon as he had departed from him, a lion found him, and slew him. 
\v 37 Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded \add him\add* . 
\v 38 So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with ashes upon his face. 
\v 39 And as the king passed by, he cried to the king: and he said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man to me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he shall be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver. 
\v 40 And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Israel said to him, So \add shall\add* thy judgment \add be\add* ; thyself hast decided \add it\add* . 
\v 41 And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the king of Israel discerned him that he \add was\add* of the prophets. 
\v 42 And he said to him, Thus saith the LORD, Because thou hast let go out of \add thy\add* hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people. 
\v 43 And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and came to Samaria. 
\c 21  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass after these things, \add that\add* Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which \add was\add* in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria. 
\v 2 And Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it \add is\add* near to my house: and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; \add or\add* if it seemeth good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money. 
\v 3 And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to thee. 
\v 4 And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased, because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid himself down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread. 
\v 5 But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said to him, Why is thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread? 
\v 6 And he said to her, Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite, and said to him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it pleaseth thee, I will give thee \add another\add* vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard. 
\v 7 And Jezebel his wife said to him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, \add and\add* eat bread, and let thy heart be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite. 
\v 8 So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed \add them\add* with his seal, and sent the letters to the elders and to the nobles that \add were\add* in his city, dwelling with Naboth. 
\v 9 And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people: 
\v 10 And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king. And \add then\add* carry him out, and stone him, that he may die. 
\v 11 And the men of his city, \add even\add* the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent to them, \add and\add* as it \add was\add* written in the letters which she had sent to them. 
\v 12 They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people. 
\v 13 And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, \add even\add* against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth blasphemed God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died. 
\v 14 Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead. 
\v 15 And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead. 
\v 16 And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab arose to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it. 
\v 17 And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, 
\v 18 Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who \add is\add* in Samaria: behold, \add he is\add* in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to possess it. 
\v 19 And thou shalt speak to him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak to him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine. 
\v 20 And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O my enemy? And he answered, I have found \add thee\add* : because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the LORD. 
\v 21 Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy posterity, and will cut off from Ahab the males, and him that is shut up and left in Israel, 
\v 22 And will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation with which thou hast provoked \add me\add* to anger, and made Israel to sin. 
\v 23 And of Jezebel also spoke the LORD, saying, the dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel. 
\v 24 Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat. 
\v 25 But there was none like Ahab, who sold himself to work wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife instigated. 
\v 26 And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all \add things\add* as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel. 
\v 27 And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly. 
\v 28 And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, 
\v 29 Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: \add but\add* in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house. 
\c 22  
\p
\v 1 And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel. 
\v 2 And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel. 
\v 3 And the king of Israel said to his servants, Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead \add is\add* ours, and we \add are\add* still, \add and\add* take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria? 
\v 4 And he said to Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramoth-gilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I \add am\add* as thou \add art\add* , my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses. 
\v 5 And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Inquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to-day. 
\v 6 Then the king of Israel assembled the prophets, about four hundred men, and said to them, Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the LORD will deliver \add it\add* into the hand of the king. 
\v 7 And Jehoshaphat said, \add Is there\add* not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we may inquire of him? 
\v 8 And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, \add There is\add* yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may inquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so. 
\v 9 Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten \add hither\add* Micaiah the son of Imlah. 
\v 10 And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them. 
\v 11 And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he said, Thus saith the LORD, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until thou hast consumed them. 
\v 12 And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper: for the LORD will deliver \add it\add* into the king's hand. 
\v 13 And the messenger that went to call Micaiah, spoke to him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets \add declare\add* good to the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak \add that which is\add* good. 
\v 14 And Micaiah said, \add As\add* the LORD liveth, what the LORD saith to me, that will I speak. 
\v 15 So he came to the king. And the king said to him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the LORD will deliver \add it\add* into the hand of the king. 
\v 16 And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but \add that which is\add* true in the name of the LORD? 
\v 17 And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace. 
\v 18 And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil? 
\v 19 And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left. 
\v 20 And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one said in this manner, and another said in that manner. 
\v 21 And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will persuade him. 
\v 22 And the LORD said to him, With what? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets? And he said, Thou shalt persuade \add him\add* , and prevail also: go forth, and do so. 
\v 23 Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil concerning thee. 
\v 24 But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak to thee? 
\v 25 And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself. 
\v 26 And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son; 
\v 27 And say, Thus saith the king, Put this \add man\add* in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction, and with water of affliction, until I come in peace. 
\v 28 And Micaiah said, If thou shalt return at all in peace, the LORD hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every one of you. 
\v 29 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead. 
\v 30 And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle. 
\v 31 But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel. 
\v 32 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it \add is\add* the king of Israel. And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out. 
\v 33 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it \add was\add* not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him. 
\v 34 And a \add certain\add* man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said to the driver of his chariot, Turn thy hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am wounded. 
\v 35 And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at evening: and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot. 
\v 36 And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the setting of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country. 
\v 37 So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria. 
\v 38 And \add one\add* washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armor; according to the word of the LORD which he spoke. 
\v 39 Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, \add are\add* they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
\v 40 So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead. 
\v 41 And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel. 
\v 42 Jehoshaphat \add was\add* thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name \add was\add* Azubah the daughter of Shilhi. 
\v 43 And he walked in all the way of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing \add that which was\add* right in the eyes of the LORD: nevertheless the high places were not taken away; \add for\add* the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places. 
\v 44 And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel. 
\v 45 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he warred, \add are\add* they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
\v 46 And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he removed from the land. 
\v 47  \add There was\add* then no king in Edom: a deputy \add was\add* king. 
\v 48 Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber. 
\v 49 Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab to Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not. 
\v 50 And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead. 
\v 51 Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel. 
\v 52 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin: 
\v 53 For he served Baal, and worshiped him, and provoked to anger the LORD God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.
