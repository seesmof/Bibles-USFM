\v 1 Now these \add are\add* the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob. 
\v 2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, 
\v 3 Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin, 
\v 4 Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher. 
\v 5 And all the souls that descended from Jacob, were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt \add already\add*. 
\v 6 And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation. 
\v 7 And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and became exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them. 
\v 8 Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph. 
\v 9 And he said to his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel \add are\add* more and mightier than we. 
\v 10 Come, let us deal wisely with them: lest they multiply, and it shall come to pass, that when there falleth out any war, they will join with our enemies, and fight against us, and depart from the land. 
\v 11 Therefore they set over them task-masters, to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure-cities, Pithom, and Raamses. 
\v 12 But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel. 
\v 13 And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor. 
\v 14 And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in mortar, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service in which they made them serve, \add was\add* with rigor. 
\v 15 And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives (of which the name of one \add was\add* Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:) 
\v 16 And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see \add them\add* upon the stools; if it \add shall be\add* a son, then ye shall kill him; but if it \add shall be\add* a daughter, then she shall live. 
\v 17 But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the male-children alive. 
\v 18 And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said to them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the male-children alive? 
\v 19 And the midwives said to Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women \add are\add* not as the Egyptian women: for they \add are\add* lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in to them. 
\v 20 Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and became very mighty. 
\v 21 And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses. 
\v 22 And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 And there went a man of the house of Levi, and married a daughter of Levi. 
\v 2 And the woman conceived, and bore a son: and when she saw him that he \add was a\add* goodly \add child\add*, she hid him three months. 
\v 3 And when she could no longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid \add it\add* in the flags by the river's brink. 
\v 4 And his sister stood afar off, to know what would be done to him. 
\v 5 And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash \add herself\add* at the river, and her maidens walked along by the river's side: and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it. 
\v 6 And when she had opened \add it\add*, she saw the child: and behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This \add is one\add* of the Hebrews' children. 
\v 7 Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go, and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee? 
\v 8 And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother. 
\v 9 And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Take this child away and nurse it for me, and I will give \add thee\add* thy wages. And the woman took the child and nursed it. 
\v 10 And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water. 
\v 11 And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out to his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren. 
\v 12 And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that \add there was\add* no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand. 
\v 13 And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Why smitest thou thy fellow? 
\v 14 And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known. 
\v 15 Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well. 
\v 16 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew \add water\add*, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock. 
\v 17 And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock. 
\v 18 And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How \add is it that\add* you are come so soon to day? 
\v 19 And they said, An Egyptian delivered us from the hand of the shepherds, and also drew \add water\add* enough for us, and watered the flock. 
\v 20 And he said to his daughters, And where \add is\add* he? why \add is\add* it \add that\add* ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread. 
\v 21 And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter. 
\v 22 And she bore \add him\add* a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land. 
\v 23 And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried; and their cry ascended to God, by reason of the bondage. 
\v 24 And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. 
\v 25 And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect to \add them\add*. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, \add even\add* to Horeb. 
\v 2 And the angel of the LORD appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush \add was\add* not consumed. 
\v 3 And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt. 
\v 4 And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called to him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here \add am\add* I. 
\v 5 And he said, Approach not hither: put off thy shoes from thy feet, for the place on which thou standest \add is\add* holy ground. 
\v 6 Moreover he said, I \add am\add* the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face: for he was afraid to look upon God. 
\v 7 And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people who \add are\add* in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their task-masters; for I know their sorrows; 
\v 8 And I am come down to deliver them from the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them out of that land, to a good land, and a large, to a land flowing with milk and honey; to the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites. 
\v 9 Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come to me: and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them. 
\v 10 Come now therefore, and I will send thee to Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt. 
\v 11 And Moses said to God, Who \add am\add* I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt? 
\v 12 And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this \add shall be\add* a token to thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain. 
\v 13 And Moses said to God, Behold, \add when\add* I come to the children of Israel, and shall say to them, The God of your fathers hath sent me to you; and they shall say to me, What \add is\add* his name? What shall I say to them? 
\v 14 And God said to Moses, I AM THAT I AM: And he said, Thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me to you. 
\v 15 And God said, moreover, to Moses, Thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me to you: this \add is\add* my name for ever, and this \add is\add* my memorial to all generations. 
\v 16 Go and assemble the elders of Israel, and say to them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared to me, saying, I have surely visited you, and \add seen\add* that which is done to you in Egypt. 
\v 17 And I have said, I will bring you out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, to a land flowing with milk and honey. 
\v 18 And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and ye shall say to him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go (we beseech thee) three days journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God. 
\v 19 And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand. 
\v 20 And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go. 
\v 21 And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that when ye go, ye shall not go empty: 
\v 22 But every woman shall borrow of her neighbor, and of her that dwelleth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put \add them\add* upon your sons, and upon your daughters: and ye shall spoil the Egyptians. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 And Moses answered and said, But behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken to my voice: for they will say, The LORD hath not appeared to thee. 
\v 2 And the LORD said to him, What \add is\add* that in thy hand? And he said, A rod. 
\v 3 And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent: and Moses fled from before it. 
\v 4 And the LORD said to Moses, Put forth thy hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand: 
\v 5 That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared to thee. 
\v 6 And the LORD said furthermore to him, Put now thy hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand \add was\add* leprous as snow. 
\v 7 And he said, Put thy hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again, and drew it out of his bosom, and behold, it was turned again as his \add other\add* flesh. 
\v 8 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign. 
\v 9 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken to thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour \add it\add* upon the dry \add land\add*: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry \add land\add*. 
\v 10 And Moses said to the LORD, O my Lord, I \add am\add* not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoke to thy servant: but I \add am\add* slow of speech, and of a slow tongue. 
\v 11 And the LORD said to him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the LORD. 
\v 12 Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say. 
\v 13 And he said, O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand \add of him whom\add* thou wilt send. 
\v 14 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said, \add Is\add* not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart. 
\v 15 And thou shalt speak to him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do. 
\v 16 And he shall speak for thee to the people: and he shall be, \add even\add* he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God. 
\v 17 And thou shalt take this rod in thy hand, with which thou shalt perform signs. 
\v 18 And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said to him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return to my brethren who \add are\add* in Egypt, and see whether they are yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace. 
\v 19 And the LORD said to Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt; for all the men are dead who sought thy life. 
\v 20 And Moses took his wife, and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt. And Moses took the rod of God in his hand. 
\v 21 And the LORD said to Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou perform all those wonders before Pharaoh which I have put in thy hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go. 
\v 22 And thou shalt say to Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel \add is\add* my son, \add even\add* my first-born. 
\v 23 And I say to thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if thou shalt refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, \add even\add* thy first-born. 
\v 24 And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him, and sought to kill him. 
\v 25 Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast \add it\add* at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband \add art\add* thou to me. 
\v 26 So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband \add thou art\add*, because of the circumcision. 
\v 27 And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him. 
\v 28 And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him, and all the signs which he had commanded him. 
\v 29 And Moses and Aaron went, and assembled all the elders of the children of Israel: 
\v 30 And Aaron spoke all the words which the LORD had spoken to Moses, and performed the signs in the sight of the people. 
\v 31 And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads, and worshiped. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness. 
\v 2 And Pharaoh said, Who \add is\add* the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go. 
\v 3 And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice to the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword. 
\v 4 And the king of Egypt said to them, Why do ye, Moses and Aaron, hinder the people from their works; go you to your burdens. 
\v 5 And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now \add are\add* many, and ye make them rest from their burdens. 
\v 6 And Pharaoh commanded the same day the task-masters of the people, and their officers, saying, 
\v 7 Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore; let them go and gather straw for themselves. 
\v 8 And the number of the bricks which they made heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish \add aught\add* thereof; for they are idle: therefore they cry, saying, Let us go \add and\add* sacrifice to our God. 
\v 9 Let more work be laid upon the men, that they may labor therein: and let them not regard vain words. 
\v 10 And the task-masters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw. 
\v 11 Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not aught of your work shall be diminished. 
\v 12 So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt, to gather stubble instead of straw. 
\v 13 And the task-masters hastened \add them\add*, saying, Fulfill your works, \add your\add* daily tasks, as when there was straw. 
\v 14 And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's task-masters had set over them, were beaten, \add and\add* demanded, Why have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick, both yesterday and to-day, as heretofore? 
\v 15 Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, saying, Why dealest thou thus with thy servants? 
\v 16 There is no straw given to thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and behold, thy servants \add are\add* beaten; but the fault \add is\add* in thy own people. 
\v 17 But he said, Ye \add are\add* idle, \add ye are\add* idle: therefore ye say, Let us go, \add and\add* do sacrifice to the LORD. 
\v 18 Go therefore now, \add and\add* work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the number of bricks. 
\v 19 And the officers of the children of Israel saw \add that\add* they \add were\add* in evil \add case\add*, after it was said, Ye shall not diminish \add aught\add* from your bricks of your daily task. 
\v 20 And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh: 
\v 21 And they said to them, The LORD look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savor to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hands to slay us. 
\v 22 And Moses returned to the LORD, and said, Lord, why hast thou \add so\add* ill treated this people? why \add is\add* it \add that\add* thou hast sent me? 
\v 23 For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1 Then the LORD said to Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh; for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand shall he drive them from his land. 
\v 2 And God spoke to Moses, and said to him, I \add am\add* the LORD: 
\v 3 And I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, by \add the name of\add* God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them. 
\v 4 And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, in which they were strangers. 
\v 5 And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage: and I have remembered my covenant. 
\v 6 Wherefore say to the children of Israel, I \add am\add* the LORD, and I will bring you from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will deliver you from their bondage, and I will redeem you with out-stretched arm, and with great judgments: 
\v 7 And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I \add am\add* the LORD your God, who bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. 
\v 8 And I will bring you into the land, concerning which I swore to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it to you for a heritage: I \add am\add* the LORD. 
\v 9 And Moses spoke so to the children of Israel: but they hearkened not to Moses, by reason of anguish of spirit, and cruel bondage. 
\v 10 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 11 Go in, speak to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel depart from his land. 
\v 12 And Moses spoke before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened to me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who \add am\add* of uncircumcised lips? 
\v 13 And the LORD spoke to Moses, and to Aaron, and gave them a charge to the children of Israel, and to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt. 
\v 14 These \add are\add* the heads of their father's houses: The sons of Reuben the first-born of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi: these \add are\add* the families of Reuben. 
\v 15 And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman: these \add are\add* the families of Simeon. 
\v 16 And these \add are\add* the names of the sons of Levi, according to their generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari. And the years of the life of Levi \add were\add* a hundred and thirty-seven years. 
\v 17 The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their families. 
\v 18 And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel: and the years of the life of Kohath \add were\add* a hundred and thirty-three years. 
\v 19 And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these \add are\add* the families of Levi, according to their generations. 
\v 20 And Amram took him Jochebed, his father's sister, for a wife; and she bore him Aaron and Moses. And the years of the life of Amram \add were\add* a hundred and thirty-seven years. 
\v 21 And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri. 
\v 22 And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri. 
\v 23 And Aaron took him Elisheba daughter of Amminadab, sister of Naashon, for a wife; and she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. 
\v 24 And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these \add are\add* the families of the Korhites. 
\v 25 And Eleazar, Aaron's son, took him \add one\add* of the daughters of Putiel for a wife; and she bore to him Phinehas: these \add are\add* the heads of the fathers of the Levites, according to their families. 
\v 26 These \add are\add* that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies. 
\v 27 These \add are\add* they who spoke to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: these \add are\add* that Moses and Aaron. 
\v 28 And it came to pass, on the day \add when\add* the LORD spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt, 
\v 29 That the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, I \add am\add* the LORD: speak thou to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, all that I say to thee. 
\v 30 And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I \add am\add* of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken to me? 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1 And the LORD said to Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet. 
\v 2 Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brother shall speak to Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of his land. 
\v 3 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt. 
\v 4 But Pharaoh shall not hearken to you, that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth my armies, my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt, by great judgments. 
\v 5 And the Egyptians shall know that I \add am\add* the LORD, when I stretch forth my hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them. 
\v 6 And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did they. 
\v 7 And Moses \add was\add* eighty years old, and Aaron eighty and three years old, when they spoke to Pharaoh. 
\v 8 And the LORD spoke to Moses, and to Aaron, saying, 
\v 9 When Pharaoh shall speak to you, saying, Show a miracle for you: then thou shalt say to Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast \add it\add* before Pharaoh, \add and\add* it shall become a serpent. 
\v 10 And Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and they did so as the LORD had commanded: And Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent. 
\v 11 Then Pharaoh also called the wise-men, and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments. 
\v 12 For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods. 
\v 13 And he hardened Pharaoh's heart that he hearkened not to them; as the LORD had said. 
\v 14 And the LORD said to Moses, Pharaoh's heart \add is\add* hardened; he refuseth to let the people go. 
\v 15 Go to Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out to the water, and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against he cometh; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thy hand. 
\v 16 And thou shalt say to him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath sent me to thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear. 
\v 17 Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I \add am\add* the LORD: behold, I will smite with the rod that \add is\add* in my hand upon the waters which \add are\add* in the river, and they shall be turned to blood. 
\v 18 And the fish that \add is\add* in the river shall die, and the river shall be offensive in smell; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river. 
\v 19 And the LORD spoke to Moses, Say to Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thy hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that they may become blood: and \add that\add* there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in \add vessels of\add* wood, and in \add vessels of\add* stone. 
\v 20 And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up the rod and smote the waters that \add were\add* in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that \add were\add* in the river were turned into blood. 
\v 21 And the fish that \add was\add* in the river died; and the river was offensive in smell, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt. 
\v 22 And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken to them; as the LORD had said. 
\v 23 And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he regard this also. 
\v 24 And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river. 
\v 25 And seven days were fulfilled after that the LORD had smitten the river. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1 And the LORD spoke to Moses, Go to Pharaoh, and say to him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go that they may serve me. 
\v 2 And if thou shalt refuse to let \add them\add* go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs: 
\v 3 And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into thy house, and into thy bed-chamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy ovens, and into thy kneading troughs: 
\v 4 And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants. 
\v 5 And the LORD spoke to Moses, Say to Aaron, Stretch forth thy hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up on the land of Egypt. 
\v 6 And Aaron stretched his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt. 
\v 7 And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt. 
\v 8 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Entreat the LORD that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people: and I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice to the LORD. 
\v 9 And Moses said to Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I entreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogs from thee, and thy houses, \add that\add* they may remain in the river only? 
\v 10 And he said, To-morrow. And he said, \add Be it\add* according to thy word; that thou mayest know that \add there is\add* none like the LORD our God. 
\v 11 And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only. 
\v 12 And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried to the LORD, because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh. 
\v 13 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses: and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields. 
\v 14 And they gathered them into heaps: and the land was offensive in smell. 
\v 15 But when Pharaoh saw that there was respit, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not to them, as the LORD had said. 
\v 16 And the LORD said to Moses, Say to Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt. 
\v 17 And they did so: for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt. 
\v 18 And the magicians did so with their inchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man and upon beast. 
\v 19 Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, This \add is\add* the finger of God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not to them; as the LORD had said. 
\v 20 And the LORD said to Moses, Rise early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; (lo, he cometh forth to the water) and say to him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me. 
\v 21 Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms \add of flies\add* upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms \add of flies\add*, and also the ground on which they \add are\add*. 
\v 22 And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms \add of flies\add* shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I \add am\add* the LORD in the midst of the earth. 
\v 23 And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to-morrow shall this sign be. 
\v 24 And the LORD did so: and there came a grievous swarm \add of flies\add* into the house of Pharaoh, and \add into\add* his servants' houses, and into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm \add of flies\add*. 
\v 25 And Pharaoh called for Moses, and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land. 
\v 26 And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: Lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us? 
\v 27 We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God as he shall command us. 
\v 28 And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away: entreat for me. 
\v 29 And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will entreat the Lord that the swarms \add of flies\add* may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to-morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more, in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD. 
\v 30 And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the LORD: 
\v 31 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms \add of flies\add* from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one. 
\v 32 And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 Then the LORD said to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me. 
\v 2 For if thou shalt refuse to let \add them\add* go, and wilt hold them still, 
\v 3 Behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which are in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and upon the sheep: \add there shall be\add* a very grievous murrain. 
\v 4 And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel, and the cattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all \add that\add* belongs to the children of Israel. 
\v 5 And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To-morrow the LORD will do this thing in the land. 
\v 6 And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one. 
\v 7 And Pharaoh sent, and behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go. 
\v 8 And the LORD said to Moses and to Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it towards heaven in the sight of Pharaoh. 
\v 9 And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth \add with\add* blains upon man, and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt. 
\v 10 And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it towards heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth \add with\add* blains upon man, and upon beast. 
\v 11 And the magicians could not stand before Moses, because of the boil: for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians. 
\v 12 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not to them; as the LORD had spoke to Moses. 
\v 13 And the LORD said to Moses, Rise early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say to him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me. 
\v 14 For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thy heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people: that thou mayest know that \add there is\add* none like me in all the earth. 
\v 15 For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth. 
\v 16 And in very deed for this \add cause\add* have I raised thee up, to show \add in\add* thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth. 
\v 17 As yet dost thou exalt thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go? 
\v 18 Behold, to-morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since its foundation even until now. 
\v 19 Send therefore now, \add and\add* gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field: \add for upon\add* every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die. 
\v 20 He that feared the word of the LORD, among the servants of Pharaoh, made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses: 
\v 21 And he that regarded not the word of the LORD, left his servants and his cattle in the field. 
\v 22 And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch forth thy hand towards heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt. 
\v 23 And Moses stretched forth his rod towards heaven, and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground: and the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt. 
\v 24 So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there had been none like it in all the land of Egypt, since it became a nation. 
\v 25 And the hail smote, throughout all the land of Egypt, all that \add was\add* in the field, both man and beast, and the hail smote every herb of the field and broke every tree of the field. 
\v 26 Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel \add were\add*, there was no hail. 
\v 27 And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said to them, I have sinned this time: the LORD \add is\add* righteous, and I and my people \add are\add* wicked. 
\v 28 Entreat the LORD (for \add it is\add* enough) that there be no \add more\add* mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer. 
\v 29 And Moses said to him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands to the LORD; \add and\add* the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how that the earth \add is\add* the LORD'S. 
\v 30 But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the LORD God. 
\v 31 And the flax and the barley were smitten: for the barley \add was\add* in the ear, and the flax \add was\add* bolled. 
\v 32 But the wheat and the rye were not smitten; for they \add were\add* not grown up. 
\v 33 And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands to the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth. 
\v 34 And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders had ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants. 
\v 35 And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the children of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1 And the LORD said to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh: for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants; that I might show these my signs before him: 
\v 2 And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I \add am\add* the LORD. 
\v 3 And Moses and Aaron came in to Pharaoh, and said to him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? Let my people go, that they may serve me. 
\v 4 Else, if thou shalt refuse to let my people go, behold, to-morrow will I bring the locusts into thy border: 
\v 5 And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which hath escaped, which remaineth to you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field: 
\v 6 And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth to this day. And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh. 
\v 7 And Pharaoh's servants said to him, How long shall this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed? 
\v 8 And Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh: and he said to them, Go, serve the LORD your God: \add but\add* who \add are\add* they that shall go? 
\v 9 And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we \add must hold\add* a feast to the LORD. 
\v 10 And he said to them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look \add to it\add*; for evil \add is\add* before you. 
\v 11 Not so: go now ye \add that are\add* men, and serve the LORD; for that you desired. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence. 
\v 12 And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, \add even\add* all that the hail hath left. 
\v 13 And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all \add that\add* night: \add and\add* when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts. 
\v 14 And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the borders of Egypt: very grievous \add were they\add*; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them will be such. 
\v 15 For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they ate every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing on the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt. 
\v 16 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you. 
\v 17 Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and entreat the LORD your God that he may take away from me this death only. 
\v 18 And he went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the LORD. 
\v 19 And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind which took away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea: there remained not one locust in all the borders of Egypt. 
\v 20 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go. 
\v 21 And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand towards heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness \add which\add* may be felt. 
\v 22 And Moses stretched forth his hand towards heaven: and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days: 
\v 23 They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings. 
\v 24 And Pharaoh called to Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go with you. 
\v 25 And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices, and burnt-offerings, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God. 
\v 26 Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not a hoof be left behind; for of them must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither. 
\v 27 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go. 
\v 28 And Pharaoh said to him, Depart from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more: for in \add that\add* day thou seest my face, thou shalt die. 
\v 29 And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 And the LORD said to Moses, Yet will I bring one plague \add more\add* upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he shall let \add you\add* go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether. 
\v 2 Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of his neighbor, and every woman of her neighbor, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold. 
\v 3 And the LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover, the man Moses \add was\add* very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people. 
\v 4 And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt: 
\v 5 And all the first-born in the land of Egypt shall die, from the first-born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even to the first-born of the maid-servant that \add is\add* behind the mill; and all the first-born of beasts. 
\v 6 And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there hath been none like it, nor shall be like it any more. 
\v 7 But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how the LORD doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel. 
\v 8 And all these thy servants shall come down to me, and bow down themselves to me, saying, Depart thou, and all the people that follow thee; and after that I will depart: and he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger. 
\v 9 And the LORD said to Moses, Pharaoh will not hearken to you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt. 
\v 10 And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh; and the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel depart from his land. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying, 
\v 2 This month \add shall be\add* to you the beginning of months: it \add shall be\add* the first month of the year to you. 
\v 3 Speak ye to all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth \add day\add* of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of \add their\add* fathers, a lamb for a house: 
\v 4 And if the household shall be too small for the lamb, let him and his neighbor next to his house take \add it\add* according to the number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb. 
\v 5 Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall take \add it\add* from the sheep or from the goats: 
\v 6 And ye shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening. 
\v 7 And they shall take of the blood, and strike \add it\add* on the two side-posts, and on the upper door-post of the houses, in which they shall eat it. 
\v 8 And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roasted with fire; and unleavened bread, \add and\add* with bitter \add herbs\add* they shall eat it. 
\v 9 Eat not of it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roasted \add with\add* fire; its head with its legs, and with its entrails. 
\v 10 And ye shall let nothing of it remain till the morning: and that which remaineth of it till the morning ye shall burn with fire. 
\v 11 And thus shall ye eat it; \add with\add* your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand: and ye shall eat it in haste; it \add is\add* the LORD'S passover. 
\v 12 For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the first-born in the land of Egypt, both man and beast: and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I \add am\add* the LORD. 
\v 13 And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye \add are\add*: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy \add you\add*, when I smite the land of Egypt. 
\v 14 And this day shall be to you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations: ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever. 
\v 15 Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whoever eateth leavened bread, from the first day till the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel. 
\v 16 And in the first day \add there shall be\add* a holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be a holy convocation to you: no manner of work shall be done in them, save \add that\add* which every man must eat, that only may be done by you. 
\v 17 And ye shall observe \add the feast of\add* unleavened bread; for in this same day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever. 
\v 18 In the first \add month\add*, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, ye shall eat unleavened bread, till the one and twentieth day of the month at evening. 
\v 19 Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he shall be a stranger, or born in the land. 
\v 20 Ye shall eat nothing leavened: in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread. 
\v 21 Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said to them, Draw out, and take you a lamb, according to your families, and kill the passover. 
\v 22 And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip \add it\add* in the blood that \add is\add* in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two side-posts with the blood that \add is\add* in the basin: and none of you shall go out at the door of his house till the morning. 
\v 23 For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side-posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in to your houses to smite \add you\add*. 
\v 24 And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever. 
\v 25 And it shall come to pass, when ye shall have come to the land which the LORD will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service. 
\v 26 And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say to you, What mean you by this service? 
\v 27 That ye shall say, It \add is\add* the sacrifice of the LORD'S passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshiped. 
\v 28 And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they. 
\v 29 And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of Pharaoh that sat on his throne, to the first-born of the captive that \add was\add* in the dungeon; and all the first-born of cattle. 
\v 30 And Pharaoh rose in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt: for \add there was\add* not a house where \add there was\add* not one dead. 
\v 31 And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Arise, \add and\add* depart from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel: and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said. 
\v 32 Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone: and bless me also. 
\v 33 And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We \add are\add* all dead \add men\add*. 
\v 34 And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading troughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders. 
\v 35 And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses: and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment. 
\v 36 And the LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent to them \add such things as they requested\add*: and they spoiled the Egyptians. 
\v 37 And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot \add that were\add* men, besides children. 
\v 38 And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, \add even\add* very many cattle. 
\v 39 And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought from Egypt, for it was not leavened: because they were driven from Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victuals. 
\v 40 Now the sojourning of the children of Israel who dwelt in Egypt, \add was\add* four hundred and thirty years. 
\v 41 And it came to pass, at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the same day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the LORD departed from the land of Egypt. 
\v 42 It \add is\add* a night to be much observed to the LORD, for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this \add is\add* that night of the LORD to be observed by all the children of Israel in their generations. 
\v 43 And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, This \add is\add* the ordinance of the passover: there shall no stranger eat of it. 
\v 44 But every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat of it. 
\v 45 A foreigner, and a hired servant shall not eat of it. 
\v 46 In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry aught of the flesh abroad out of the house: neither shall ye break a bone of it. 
\v 47 All the congregation of Israel shall keep it. 
\v 48 And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat of it. 
\v 49 One law shall be to him that is home-born, and to the stranger that sojourneth among you. 
\v 50 Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they. 
\v 51 And it came to pass the same day, \add that\add* the LORD brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Sanctify to me all the first-born, whatever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, \add both\add* of man and of beast: it \add is\add* mine. 
\v 3 And Moses said to the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this \add place\add*: there shall no leavened bread be eaten. 
\v 4 This day ye came out in the month Abib. 
\v 5 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he swore to thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey; that thou shalt keep this service in this month. 
\v 6 Seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day \add shall be\add* a feast to the LORD. 
\v 7 Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days: and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters. 
\v 8 And thou shalt show thy son in that day, saying, \add This is done\add* because of that \add which\add* the LORD did to me when I came forth out of Egypt. 
\v 9 And it shall be for a sign to thee upon thy hand, and for a memorial between thy eyes; that the LORD'S law may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt. 
\v 10 Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year. 
\v 11 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, as he swore to thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it to thee, 
\v 12 That thou shall set apart to the LORD all that openeth the matrix; and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast, the males \add shall be\add* the LORD'S. 
\v 13 And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all the first-born of man among thy children shalt thou redeem. 
\v 14 And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What \add is\add* this? that thou shalt say to him, By strength of hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage: 
\v 15 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the LORD slew all the first-born in the land of Egypt, both the first-born of man, and the first-born of beasts: therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all that openeth the matrix, being males; but all the first-born of my children I redeem. 
\v 16 And it shall be for a token upon thy hand, and for frontlets between thy eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt. 
\v 17 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not \add through\add* the way of the land of the Philistines, although that \add was\add* near, for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt. 
\v 18 But God led the people about, \add through\add* the way of the wilderness of the Red Sea: and the children of Israel went up harnassed from the land of Egypt. 
\v 19 And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had strictly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones hence with you. 
\v 20 And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness. 
\v 21 And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them in the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light: to go by day and night. 
\v 22 He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, \add from\add* before the people. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Speak to the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baal-zephon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea. 
\v 3 For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They \add are\add* entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in. 
\v 4 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow them; and I will be honored upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the Egyptians may know that I \add am\add* the LORD. And they did so. 
\v 5 And it was told to the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us? 
\v 6 And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him: 
\v 7 And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them. 
\v 8 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with a high hand. 
\v 9 But the Egyptians pursued them (all the horses \add and\add* chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army) and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, before Baal-zephon. 
\v 10 And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were greatly afraid; and the children of Israel cried to the LORD. 
\v 11 And they said to Moses, Because \add there were\add* no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why hast thou dealt thus with us, to conduct us out of Egypt? 
\v 12  \add Is\add* not this the word that we told thee in Egypt, Saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For \add it had been\add* better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness. 
\v 13 And Moses said to the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will show to you to-day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to-day, ye shall see them again no more for ever. 
\v 14 The LORD will fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace. 
\v 15 And the LORD said to Moses, Why criest thou to me? Speak to the children of Israel, that they go forward: 
\v 16 But lift thou thy rod, and stretch out thy hand over the sea, and divide it; and the children of Israel shall go on dry \add ground\add* through the midst of the sea. 
\v 17 And I, behold I, will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honor upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots and upon his horsemen. 
\v 18 And the Egyptians shall know that I \add am\add* the LORD, when I have gotten me honor upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen. 
\v 19 And the angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, removed, and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them: 
\v 20 And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness \add to them\add*, but it gave light by night \add to these\add*: so that the one came not near the other all the night. 
\v 21 And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the LORD caused the sea to go \add back\add* by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry \add land\add*, and the waters were divided. 
\v 22 And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry \add ground\add*: and the waters \add were\add* a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left. 
\v 23 And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, \add even\add* all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen. 
\v 24 And it came to pass, that, in the morning-watch, the LORD looked to the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire, and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians, 
\v 25 And took off their chariot-wheels, and made them to move heavily, so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD fighteth for them against the Egyptians. 
\v 26 And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen. 
\v 27 And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea. 
\v 28 And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, \add and\add* all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them. 
\v 29 But the children of Israel walked upon dry \add land\add* in the midst of the sea; and the waters \add were\add* a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left. 
\v 30 Thus the LORD saved Israel that day from the hand of the Egyptians: and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea-shore. 
\v 31 And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and his servant Moses. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1 Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song to the LORD, and spoke, saying, I will sing to the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. 
\v 2 The LORD \add is\add* my strength and song, and he \add is\add* become my salvation: he \add is\add* my God, and I will prepare him a habitation; my father's God, and I will exalt him. 
\v 3 The LORD \add is\add* a man of war: the LORD \add is\add* his name. 
\v 4 Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea. 
\v 5 The depths have covered them: they sunk to the bottom as a stone. 
\v 6 Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy right hand, O LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy. 
\v 7 And in the greatness of thy excellence thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, \add which\add* consumed them as stubble. 
\v 8 And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were collected, the floods stood upright as a heap, \add and\add* the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea. 
\v 9 The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them. 
\v 10 Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sunk as lead in the mighty waters. 
\v 11 Who \add is\add* like to thee, O LORD, among the gods? who \add is\add* like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders! 
\v 12 Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them. 
\v 13 Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people \add which\add* thou hast redeemed: thou hast guided \add them\add* in thy strength to thy holy habitation. 
\v 14 The people shall hear, \add and\add* be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina. 
\v 15 Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away. 
\v 16 Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thy arm they shall be \add as\add* still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O LORD, till the people pass over, \add which\add* thou hast purchased. 
\v 17 Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thy inheritance, \add in\add* the place, O LORD, \add which\add* thou hast made for thee to dwell in; \add in\add* the sanctuary, O LORD. \add which\add* thy hands have established. 
\v 18 The LORD shall reign for ever and ever. 
\v 19 For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry \add land\add* in the midst of the sea. 
\v 20 And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her, with timbrels, and with dances. 
\v 21 And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. 
\v 22 So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water. 
\v 23 And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah; for they \add were\add* bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah. 
\v 24 And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink? 
\v 25 And he cried to the LORD; and the LORD showed him a tree, \add which\add* he cast into the waters, \add and\add* the waters were made sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them, 
\v 26 And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes; I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians; for I \add am\add* the LORD that healeth thee. 
\v 27 And they came to Elim, where \add were\add* twelve wells of water, and seventy palm-trees: and they encamped there by the waters. 
\c 16  
\p
\v 1 And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which \add is\add* between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departure from the land of Egypt. 
\v 2 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness. 
\v 3 And the children of Israel said to them, O that we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh-pots, \add and\add* when we did eat bread to the full: for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger. 
\v 4 Then said the LORD to Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or not. 
\v 5 And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare \add that\add* which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily. 
\v 6 And Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel, At evening, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the land of Egypt: 
\v 7 And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the LORD; for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: And what \add are\add* we, that ye murmur against us? 
\v 8 And Moses said, \add This shall be\add* when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: And what \add are\add* we? your murmurings \add are\add* not against us, but against the LORD. 
\v 9 And Moses spoke to Aaron, Say to all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he hath heard your murmurings. 
\v 10 And it came to pass, as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked towards the wilderness, and behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud. 
\v 11 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 12 I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel; Speak to them, saying, At evening ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread: and ye shall know that I \add am\add* the LORD your God. 
\v 13 And it came to pass, that at evening the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay around the host. 
\v 14 And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness \add there lay\add* a small round thing, \add as\add* small as the hoar frost on the ground: 
\v 15 And when the children of Israel saw \add it\add*, they said one to another, It \add is\add* manna: for they knew not what it \add was\add*. And Moses said to them, This \add is\add* the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat. 
\v 16 This \add is\add* the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating: an omer for every man \add according to\add* the number of your persons, take ye every man for \add them\add* who \add are\add* in his tents. 
\v 17 And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less. 
\v 18 And when they measured \add it\add* with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack: they gathered every man according to his eating. 
\v 19 And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning. 
\v 20 Notwithstanding, they hearkened not to Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and became offensive; and Moses was wroth with them. 
\v 21 And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun became hot, it melted. 
\v 22 And it came to pass, \add that\add* on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one \add man\add*: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses. 
\v 23 And he said to them, This \add is that\add* which the LORD hath said, To-morrow \add is\add* the rest of the holy sabbath to the LORD: bake \add that\add* which ye will bake \add to-day\add*, and boil that ye will boil; and that which remaineth over, lay up for you to be kept until the morning. 
\v 24 And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses ordered: and it did not putrefy, neither was there any worm therein. 
\v 25 And Moses said, Eat that to-day; for to-day \add is\add* a sabbath to the LORD; to-day ye will not find it in the field. 
\v 26 Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, \add which is\add* the sabbath, in it there will be none. 
\v 27 And it came to pass, \add that some\add* of the people went out on the seventh day to gather, and they found none. 
\v 28 And the LORD said to Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws? 
\v 29 See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days: abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day. 
\v 30 So the people rested on the seventh day. 
\v 31 And the house of Israel called its name Manna: and it \add was\add* like coriander-seed, white; and the taste of it \add was\add* like wafers \add made\add* with honey. 
\v 32 And Moses said, This \add is\add* the thing which the LORD commanded, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt. 
\v 33 And Moses said to Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations. 
\v 34 As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept. 
\v 35 And the children of Israel ate manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited: they ate manna, until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan. 
\v 36 Now an omer \add is\add* the tenth \add part\add* of an ephah. 
\c 17  
\p
\v 1 And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of the LORD, and encamped in Rephidim: and \add there was\add* no water for the people to drink. 
\v 2 Wherefore the people contended with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said to them, Why chide you with me? why do ye tempt the LORD? 
\v 3 And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Why \add is\add* this \add that\add* thou hast brought us out of Egypt to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst? 
\v 4 And Moses cried to the LORD, saying, What shall I do to this people? they are almost ready to stone me. 
\v 5 And the LORD said to Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel: and thy rod, with which thou smotest the river, take in thy hand, and go. 
\v 6 Behold, I will stand before thee there on the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and water shall come out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel. 
\v 7 And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not? 
\v 8 Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim. 
\v 9 And Moses said to Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to-morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand. 
\v 10 So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur, went up to the top of the hill. 
\v 11 And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed. 
\v 12 But Moses's hands \add were\add* heavy; and they took a stone, and put \add it\add* under him, and he sat upon it: and Aaron and Hur supported his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun. 
\v 13 And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword. 
\v 14 And the LORD said to Moses, Write this \add for\add* a memorial in a book, and rehearse \add it\add* in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven. 
\v 15 And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it JEHOVAH-nissi: 
\v 16 For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn \add that\add* the LORD \add will have\add* war with Amalek from generation to generation. 
\c 18  
\p
\v 1 When Jethro the priest of Midian, Moses's father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, \add and\add* that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt: 
\v 2 Then Jethro, Moses's father-in-law, took Zipporah Moses's wife, after he had sent her back, 
\v 3 And her two sons; of which the name of the one \add was\add* Gershom; (for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land:) 
\v 4 And the name of the other \add was\add* Eliezer; (for the God of my father, \add said he\add*, \add was\add* my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh:) 
\v 5 And Jethro, Moses's father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God: 
\v 6 And he said to Moses, I thy father-in-law Jethro have come to thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her. 
\v 7 And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and did obeisance, and kissed him: and they asked each other of \add their\add* welfare: and they came into the tent. 
\v 8 And Moses told his father-in-law all that the LORD had done to Pharaoh, and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, \add and\add* all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and \add how\add* the LORD delivered them. 
\v 9 And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians. 
\v 10 And Jethro said, Blessed \add be\add* the LORD, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians. 
\v 11 Now I know that the LORD \add is\add* greater than all gods: for in the thing in which they dealt proudly, \add he was\add* above them. 
\v 12 And Jethro, Moses's father-in-law, took a burnt-offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel to eat bread with Moses's father-in-law before God. 
\v 13 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning to the evening. 
\v 14 And when Moses's father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What \add is\add* this thing that thou doest to the people? Why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning to evening? 
\v 15 And Moses said to his father-in-law, Because the people come to me to inquire of God: 
\v 16 When they have a matter, they come to me, and I judge between one and another, and I make \add them\add* know the statutes of God, and his laws. 
\v 17 And Moses's father-in-law said to him, The thing that thou doest \add is\add* not good. 
\v 18 Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that \add is\add* with thee: for this thing \add is\add* too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone. 
\v 19 Hearken now to my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people toward God, that thou mayest bring the causes to God: 
\v 20 And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt show them the way in which they must walk, and the work that they must do. 
\v 21 Moreover, thou shalt provide out of all the people, able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place \add such\add* over them \add to be\add* rulers of thousands, \add and\add* rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens: 
\v 22 And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, \add that\add* every great matter they shall bring to thee, but every small matter they shall judge: So shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear \add the burden\add* with thee. 
\v 23 If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee \add so\add*, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace. 
\v 24 So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said. 
\v 25 And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. 
\v 26 And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought to Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves. 
\v 27 And Moses let his father-in-law depart; and he went his way into his own land. 
\c 19  
\p
\v 1 In the third month, when the children of Israel had gone forth from the land of Egypt, the same day they came \add into\add* the wilderness of Sinai. 
\v 2 For they had departed from Rephidim, and had come \add to\add* the desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel encamped before the mount. 
\v 3 And Moses went up to God, and the LORD called to him from the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel; 
\v 4 Ye have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and \add how\add* I bore you on eagles' wings, and brought you to myself. 
\v 5 Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure to me above all people: for all the earth \add is\add* mine: 
\v 6 And ye shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation. These \add are\add* the words which thou shalt speak to the children of Israel. 
\v 7 And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him. 
\v 8 And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people to the LORD. 
\v 9 And the LORD said to Moses, Lo, I come to thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people to the LORD. 
\v 10 And the LORD said to Moses, Go to the people, and sanctify them to-day and to-morrow, and let them wash their clothes, 
\v 11 And be ready against the third day: for on the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai. 
\v 12 And thou shalt set bounds to the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, \add that ye\add* go \add not\add* up upon the mount, or touch the border of it: whoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death: 
\v 13 There shall not a hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned or shot through: whether \add it be\add* beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount. 
\v 14 And Moses went down from the mount to the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes. 
\v 15 And he said to the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at \add your\add* wives. 
\v 16 And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that \add were\add* in the camp trembled. 
\v 17 And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount. 
\v 18 And mount Sinai was altogether in a smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke of it ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount trembled greatly. 
\v 19 And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice. 
\v 20 And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the LORD called Moses to the top of the mount; and Moses went up. 
\v 21 And the LORD said to Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through to the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish. 
\v 22 And let the priests also who come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them. 
\v 23 And Moses said to the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it. 
\v 24 And the LORD said to him, Away, go down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: But let not the priests and the people break through, to come up to the LORD, lest he break forth upon them. 
\v 25 So Moses went down to the people, and spoke to them. 
\c 20  
\p
\v 1 And God spoke all these words, saying, 
\v 2 I \add am\add* the LORD thy God, who have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. 
\v 3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me. 
\v 4 Thou shalt not make to thee any graven image, or any likeness \add of any thing\add* that \add is\add* in heaven above, or that \add is\add* in the earth beneath, or that \add is\add* in the water under the earth: 
\v 5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God \add am\add* a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth \add generation\add* of them that hate me; 
\v 6 And showing mercy to thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments. 
\v 7 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. 
\v 8 Remember the sabbath-day to keep it holy. 
\v 9 Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work: 
\v 10 But the seventh day \add is\add* the sabbath of the LORD thy God: \add in it\add* thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that \add is\add* within thy gates: 
\v 11 For \add in\add* six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that \add is\add* in them, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath-day, and hallowed it. 
\v 12 Honor thy father and thy mother; that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee. 
\v 13 Thou shalt not kill. 
\v 14 Thou shalt not commit adultery. 
\v 15 Thou shalt not steal. 
\v 16 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor. 
\v 17 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his man-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that \add is\add* thy neighbor's. 
\v 18 And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw \add it\add*, they removed, and stood afar off. 
\v 19 And they said to Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die. 
\v 20 And Moses said to the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not. 
\v 21 And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God \add was\add*. 
\v 22 And the LORD said to Moses, Thus thou shalt say to the children of Israel; Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven. 
\v 23 Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make to you gods of gold. 
\v 24 An altar of earth thou shalt make to me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt-offerings, and thy peace-offerings, thy sheep, and thy oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come to thee, and I will bless thee. 
\v 25 And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou \add shalt\add* lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it. 
\v 26 Neither shalt thou go up by steps to my altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon. 
\c 21  
\p
\v 1 Now these \add are\add* the judgments which thou shalt set before them. 
\v 2 If thou shalt buy a Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall depart free for nothing. 
\v 3 If he came in by himself, he shall depart by himself: if he was married, then his wife shall depart with him. 
\v 4 If his master hath given him a wife, and she hath borne him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall depart by himself. 
\v 5 And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not depart free: 
\v 6 Then his master shall bring him to the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or to the door-post: and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever. 
\v 7 And if a man shall sell his daughter to be a maid-servant, she shall not depart as the men-servants do. 
\v 8 If she shall not please her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her to a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her. 
\v 9 And if he hath betrothed her to his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters. 
\v 10 If he shall take him another \add wife\add*; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage shall he not diminish. 
\v 11 And if he shall not perform these three to her, then shall she depart free without money. 
\v 12 He that smiteth a man, so that he dieth, shall be surely put to death. 
\v 13 And if a man shall not lie in wait, but God shall deliver \add him\add* into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee. 
\v 14 But if a man shall come presumptuously upon his neighbor, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from my altar, that he may die. 
\v 15 And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death. 
\v 16 And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he shall be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death. 
\v 17 And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death. 
\v 18 And if men contend together, and one shall smite another with a stone, or with \add his\add* fist, and he shall not die, but keep \add his\add* bed: 
\v 19 If he shall rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote \add him\add* be quit: only he shall pay \add for\add* the loss of his time, and shall cause \add him\add* to be thoroughly healed. 
\v 20 And if a man shall smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he shall die under his hand; he shall be surely punished. 
\v 21 Notwithstanding, if he shall continue a day or two, he shall not be punished; for he \add is\add* his money. 
\v 22 If men shall contend, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit shall depart \add from her\add*, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges \add determine\add*. 
\v 23 And if \add any\add* mischief shall follow, then thou shalt give life for life, 
\v 24 Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 
\v 25 Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe. 
\v 26 And if a man shall smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, that it shall perish; he shall let him go free for his eye's sake. 
\v 27 And if he shall smite out his man-servant's tooth, or his maid-servant's tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake. 
\v 28 If an ox shall gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox \add shall be\add* quit. 
\v 29 But if the ox was accustomed to push with his horn in time past, and it hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not restrained him, but that he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death. 
\v 30 If there shall be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatever is laid upon him. 
\v 31 Whether he hath gored a son, or hath gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done to him. 
\v 32 If the ox shall push a man-servant, or maid-servant; he shall give to their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned. 
\v 33 And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, and not cover it, and an ox or an ass shall fall into it; 
\v 34 The owner of the pit shall make compensation, \add and\add* give money to the owner of them; and the dead \add beast\add* shall be his. 
\v 35 And if one man's ox shall hurt another's that he shall die, then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the money of it, and the dead \add ox\add* also they shall divide. 
\v 36 Or if it shall be known that the ox hath used to push in time past, and his owner hath not restrained him; he shall surely pay ox for ox, and the dead shall be his own. 
\c 22  
\p
\v 1 If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep. 
\v 2 If a thief shall be found breaking through, and be smitten that he die, \add there shall\add* no blood \add be shed\add* for him. 
\v 3 If the sun shall have risen upon him, \add there shall be\add* blood \add shed\add* for him: \add for\add* he should make full restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft. 
\v 4 If the theft shall be certainly found in his hand alive, whether an ox, or ass, or sheep; he shall restore double. 
\v 5 If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall put in his beast, and shall feed in another man's field: of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard shall he make restitution. 
\v 6 If fire shall break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of corn, or the standing corn, or the field shall be consumed; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution. 
\v 7 If a man shall deliver to his neighbor money or stuff to keep, and it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief shall be found, let him pay double. 
\v 8 If the thief shall not be found, then the master of the house shall be brought to the judges, \add to see\add* whether he hath put his hand to his neighbor's goods. 
\v 9 For all manner of trespass, \add whether it be\add* for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment, \add or\add* for any manner of lost thing which \add another\add* challengeth to be his: the cause of both parties shall come before the judges; \add and\add* he whom the judges shall condemn, shall pay double to his neighbor. 
\v 10 If a man shall deliver to his neighbor an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast to keep; and it shall die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing \add it\add*: 
\v 11  \add Then\add* shall an oath of the LORD be between them both, that he hath not put his hand to his neighbor's goods; and the owner of it shall accept of it, and he shall not make restitution. 
\v 12 And if it shall be stolen from him, he shall make restitution to the owner of it. 
\v 13 If it shall be torn in pieces; \add then\add* let him bring it \add for\add* witness, \add and\add* he shall not make good that which was torn. 
\v 14 And if a man shall borrow \add aught\add* of his neighbor, and it shall be hurt, or die, the owner of it \add being\add* not with it, he shall surely make \add it\add* good. 
\v 15  \add But\add* if the owner of it shall \add be\add* with it, he shall not make \add it\add* good: if it \add be\add* a hired \add thing\add*, it came for his hire. 
\v 16 And if a man shall entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife. 
\v 17 If her father shall utterly refuse to give her to him, he shall pay money according to the dower of virgins. 
\v 18 Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live. 
\v 19 Whoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death. 
\v 20 He that sacrificeth to \add any\add* god, save to the LORD only, he shall be utterly destroyed. 
\v 21 Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt. 
\v 22 Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child. 
\v 23 If thou shalt afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all to me, I will surely hear their cry: 
\v 24 And my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless. 
\v 25 If thou shalt lend money to \add any of\add* my people \add that is\add* poor by thee, thou shalt not be to him as a usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him usury. 
\v 26 If thou shalt at all take thy neighbor's raiment to pledge, thou shalt deliver it to him by the setting of the sun. 
\v 27 For that \add is\add* his only covering, it \add is\add* his raiment for his skin: wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth to me, that I will hear; for I \add am\add* gracious. 
\v 28 Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy people. 
\v 29 Thou shalt not delay \add to offer\add* the first of thy ripe fruits, and of thy liquors: the first-born of thy sons shalt thou give to me. 
\v 30 Likewise shalt thou do with thy oxen, \add and\add* with thy sheep: seven days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it to me. 
\v 31 And ye shall be holy men to me: neither shall ye eat \add any\add* flesh \add that is\add* torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs. 
\c 23  
\p
\v 1 Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thy hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness. 
\v 2 Thou shalt not follow a multitude to \add do\add* evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest \add judgment\add*: 
\v 3 Neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause. 
\v 4 If thou shalt meet thy enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again. 
\v 5 If thou shalt see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with him. 
\v 6 Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause. 
\v 7 Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked. 
\v 8 And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise, and perverteth the words of the righteous. 
\v 9 Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger; for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt. 
\v 10 And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the fruits thereof: 
\v 11 But the seventh \add year\add* thou shalt let it rest and lie still; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave, the beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, \add and\add* with thy olive-yard. 
\v 12 Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest: that thy ox and thy ass may rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed. 
\v 13 And in all \add things\add* that I have said to you be circumspect: and make no mention of the names of other gods, neither let it be heard from thy mouth. 
\v 14 Three times thou shalt keep a feast to me in the year. 
\v 15 Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time appointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt: and none shall appear before me empty:) 
\v 16 And the feast of harvest, the first-fruits of thy labors, which thou hast sown in the field: and the feast of in-gathering, \add which\add* is in the end of the year, when thou hast gathered in thy labors out of the field. 
\v 17 Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the LORD God. 
\v 18 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning. 
\v 19 The first of the first-fruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk. 
\v 20 Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared. 
\v 21 Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for my name \add is\add* in him. 
\v 22 But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy to thy enemies, and an adversary to thy adversaries. 
\v 23 For my Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in to the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, \add and\add* the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I will cut them off. 
\v 24 Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite break down their images. 
\v 25 And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he will bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee. 
\v 26 There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy land: I will complete the number of thy days. 
\v 27 I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thy enemies turn their backs to thee. 
\v 28 And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite from before thee. 
\v 29 I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest the land should become desolate, and the beast of the field should multiply against thee. 
\v 30 By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou shalt be increased and inherit the land. 
\v 31 And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even to the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert to the river: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out before thee. 
\v 32 Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods. 
\v 33 They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee to sin against me: for if thou shalt serve their gods, it will surely be a snare to thee. 
\c 24  
\p
\v 1 And he said to Moses, Come up to the LORD, thou, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship ye afar off. 
\v 2 And Moses alone shall come near the LORD: but they shall not come nigh; neither shall the people go up with him. 
\v 3 And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD, and all the judgments: and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which the LORD hath said will we perform. 
\v 4 And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD, and rose early in the morning, and built an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars according to the twelve tribes of Israel. 
\v 5 And he sent young men of the children of Israel, who offered burnt-offerings, and sacrificed peace-offerings of oxen to the LORD. 
\v 6 And Moses took half of the blood, and put \add it\add* in basins; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar. 
\v 7 And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people: and they said, All that the LORD hath said will we do, and be obedient. 
\v 8 And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled \add it\add* on the people, and said, Behold, the blood of the covenant, which the LORD hath made with you concerning all these words. 
\v 9 Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel: 
\v 10 And they saw the God of Israel: and \add there was\add* under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire-stone, and as it were the body of heaven in \add its\add* clearness. 
\v 11 And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: also they saw God, and ate and drank. 
\v 12 And the LORD said to Moses, Come up to me on the mount, and be there: and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written; that thou mayst teach them. 
\v 13 And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up upon the mount of God. 
\v 14 And he said to the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we come again to you: and behold, Aaron and Hur \add are\add* with you: if any man hath any matters to do, let him come to them. 
\v 15 And Moses went up upon the mount, and a cloud covered the mount. 
\v 16 And the glory of the LORD abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called to Moses from the midst of the cloud. 
\v 17 And the sight of the glory of the LORD \add was\add* like devouring fire on the top of the mount, in the eyes of the children of Israel. 
\v 18 And Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and ascended the mount: and Moses was on the mount forty days and forty nights. 
\c 25  
\p
\v 1 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Speak to the children of Israel, that they bring me an offering: of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering. 
\v 3 And this \add is\add* the offering which ye shall take of them; gold, and silver and brass, 
\v 4 And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' \add hair\add*. 
\v 5 And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood. 
\v 6 Oil for the light, spices for anointing oil, and for sweet incense, 
\v 7 Onyx stones, and stones to be set in the ephod, and in the breast-plate. 
\v 8 And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them. 
\v 9 According to all that I show thee \add after\add* the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all its instruments, even so shall ye make \add it\add*. 
\v 10 And they shall make an ark \add of\add* shittim wood: two cubits and a half \add shall be\add* its length, and a cubit and a half its breadth, and a cubit and a half its hight. 
\v 11 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without shalt thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold around it. 
\v 12 And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put \add them\add* in its four corners; and two rings \add shall be\add* in the one side of it, and two rings in the other side of it. 
\v 13 And thou shalt make staffs \add of\add* shittim wood, and overlay them with gold. 
\v 14 And thou shalt put the staffs into the rings by the sides of the ark, that the ark may be borne with them. 
\v 15 The staffs shall be in the rings of the ark: they shall not be taken from it. 
\v 16 And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee. 
\v 17 And thou shalt make a mercy-seat \add of\add* pure gold: two cubits and a half \add shall be\add* its length, and a cubit and a half its breadth. 
\v 18 And thou shalt make two cherubim \add of\add* gold, \add of\add* beaten work shalt thou make them, in the two ends of the mercy-seat. 
\v 19 And make one cherub on the one end, and the other cherub on the other end: \add even\add* of the mercy-seat shall ye make the cherubim on its two ends. 
\v 20 And the cherubim shall stretch forth \add their\add* wings on high, covering the mercy-seat with their wings, and their faces \add shall look\add* one to another; towards the mercy-seat shall the faces of the cherubim be. 
\v 21 And thou shalt put the mercy-seat above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee. 
\v 22 And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercy-seat, from between the two cherubim which \add are\add* upon the ark of the testimony, of all \add things\add* which I will give thee in commandment to the children of Israel. 
\v 23 Thou shalt also make a table \add of\add* shittim wood: its length shall be two cubits, and its breadth a cubit, and its hight a cubit and a half. 
\v 24 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and make to it a crown of gold around it. 
\v 25 And thou shalt make to it a border of an hand-breadth around it, and thou shalt make a golden crown to its border around it. 
\v 26 And thou shalt make for it four rings of gold, and put the rings in the four corners that \add are\add* on its four feet. 
\v 27 Over against the border shall the rings be for places of the staffs to bear the table. 
\v 28 And thou shalt make the staffs \add of\add* shittim wood, and overlay them with gold, that the table may be borne with them. 
\v 29 And thou shalt make its dishes, and its spoons, and its covers, and its bowls, to cover it with: \add of\add* pure gold shalt thou make them. 
\v 30 And thou shalt set upon the table show-bread before me always. 
\v 31 And thou shalt make a candlestick \add of\add* pure gold: \add of\add* beaten work shall the candlestick be made: its shaft, and its branches, its bowls, its knobs, and its flowers, shall be of the same. 
\v 32 And six branches shall extend from the sides of it; three branches of the candlestick from the one side, and three branches of the candlestick from the other side: 
\v 33 Three bowls made like to almonds, \add with\add* a knob and a flower in one branch; and three bowls made like almonds in the other branch, \add with\add* a knob and a flower: so in the six branches that project from the candlestick. 
\v 34 And in the candlesticks \add shall be\add* four bowls made like to almonds, \add with\add* their knobs and their flowers. 
\v 35 And \add there shall be\add* a knob under two branches of the same, and a knob under two branches of the same, and a knob under two branches of the same, according to the six branches that project from the candlestick. 
\v 36 Their knobs and their branches shall be of the same: all of it \add shall be\add* one beaten work \add of\add* pure gold. 
\v 37 And thou shalt make its seven lamps: and they shall light its lamps, that they may give light over against it. 
\v 38 And its tongs, and its snuff-dishes, \add shall be of\add* pure gold. 
\v 39  \add Of\add* a talent of pure gold shall he make it, with all these vessels. 
\v 40 And look that thou make \add them\add* after their pattern, which was shown thee on the mount. 
\c 26  
\p
\v 1 Moreover, thou shalt make the tabernacle \add with\add* ten curtains \add of\add* fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: \add with\add* cherubim of curious work shalt thou make them. 
\v 2 The length of one curtain \add shall be\add* eight and twenty cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: and every one of the curtains shall have one measure. 
\v 3 The five curtains shall be coupled together one to another; and \add other\add* five curtains \add shall be\add* coupled one to another. 
\v 4 And thou shalt make loops of blue upon the edge of the one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling; and likewise shalt thou make in the uttermost edge of \add another\add* curtain, in the coupling of the second. 
\v 5 Fifty loops shalt thou make in the one curtain, and fifty loops shalt thou make in the edge of the curtain that \add is\add* in the coupling of the second; that the loops may take hold one of another. 
\v 6 And thou shalt make fifty buttons of gold, and couple the curtains together with the buttons: and it shall be one tabernacle. 
\v 7 And thou shalt make curtains \add of\add* goats' \add hair\add* to be a covering upon the tabernacle: eleven curtains shalt thou make. 
\v 8 The length of one curtain \add shall be\add* thirty cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: and the eleven curtains \add shall be all\add* of one measure. 
\v 9 And thou shalt couple five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves, and shalt double the sixth curtain in the front of the tabernacle. 
\v 10 And thou shalt make fifty loops on the edge of the one curtain \add that is\add* outmost in the coupling, and fifty loops in the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second. 
\v 11 And thou shalt make fifty buttons of brass, and put the buttons into the loops, and couple the tent together, that it may be one. 
\v 12 And the remnant that remaineth of the curtains of the tent, the half curtain that remaineth, shall hang over the backside of the tabernacle. 
\v 13 And a cubit on the one side, and a cubit on the other side of that which remaineth in the length of the curtains of the tent, shall hang over the sides of the tabernacle on this side and on that side, to cover it. 
\v 14 And thou shalt make a covering for the tent, \add of\add* rams' skins dyed red, and a covering above \add of\add* badgers' skins. 
\v 15 And thou shalt make boards for the tabernacle \add of\add* shittim wood standing up. 
\v 16 Ten cubits \add shall be\add* the length of a board, and a cubit and a half \add shall be\add* the breadth of one board. 
\v 17 Two tenons \add shall there be\add* in one board, set in order one against another: thus shalt thou make for all the boards of the tabernacle. 
\v 18 And thou shalt make the boards for the tabernacle, twenty boards on the south side southward. 
\v 19 And thou shalt make forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for its two tenons, and two sockets under another board for its two tenons. 
\v 20 And for the second side of the tabernacle on the north side \add there shall be\add* twenty boards: 
\v 21 And their forty sockets \add of\add* silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board. 
\v 22 And for the sides of the tabernacle westward thou shalt make six boards. 
\v 23 And two boards shalt thou make for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides. 
\v 24 And they shall be coupled together beneath, and they shall be coupled together above the head of it to one ring: thus shall it be for them both; they shall be for the two corners. 
\v 25 And they shall be eight boards, and their sockets \add of\add* silver, sixteen sockets; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board. 
\v 26 And thou shalt make bars \add of\add* shittim wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle, 
\v 27 And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the side of the tabernacle, for the two sides westward. 
\v 28 And the middle bar in the midst of the boards shall reach from end to end. 
\v 29 And thou shalt overlay the boards with gold, and make their rings \add of\add* gold \add for\add* places for the bars; and thou shalt overlay the bars with gold. 
\v 30 And thou shalt rear up the tabernacle according to the fashion thereof which was shown thee on the mount. 
\v 31 And thou shalt make a vail \add of\add* blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen of curious work: with cherubim shall it be made. 
\v 32 And thou shalt hang it upon four pillars of shittim \add wood\add* overlaid with gold: their hooks \add shall be of\add* gold, upon the four sockets of silver. 
\v 33 And thou shalt hang the vail under the buttons, that thou mayst bring in thither within the vail the ark of the testimony: and the vail shall divide to you between the holy \add place\add* and the most holy. 
\v 34 And thou shalt put the mercy-seat upon the ark of the testimony, in the most holy \add place\add*. 
\v 35 And thou shalt set the table without the vail, and the candlestick over against the table on the side of the tabernacle towards the south: and thou shalt put the table on the north side. 
\v 36 And thou shalt make a hanging for the door of the tent, \add of\add* blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, wrought with needle work.

\c 29  
\p
\v 1 And this \add is\add* the thing that thou shalt do to them to hallow them, to minister to me in the priest's office: Take one young bullock, and two rams without blemish, 
\v 2 And unleavened bread, and cakes unleavened tempered with oil, and wafers unleavened anointed with oil; \add of\add* wheat flour shalt thou make them. 
\v 3 And thou shalt put them into one basket, and bring them in the basket, with the bullock and the two rams. 
\v 4 And Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shalt wash them with water. 
\v 5 And thou shalt take the garments, and put upon Aaron, the coat, and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breast-plate, and gird him with the curious girdle of the ephod: 
\v 6 And thou shalt put the miter upon his head, and put the holy crown upon the miter. 
\v 7 Then shalt thou take the anointing oil, and pour \add it\add* upon his head, and anoint him. 
\v 8 And thou shalt bring his sons, and put coats upon them. 
\v 9 And thou shalt gird them with girdles (Aaron and his sons) and put the bonnets on them; and the priest's office shall be theirs for a perpetual statute: and thou shalt consecrate Aaron and his sons. 
\v 10 And thou shalt cause a bullock to be brought before the tabernacle of the congregation; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the bullock. 
\v 11 And thou shalt kill the bullock before the LORD, \add by\add* the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
\v 12 And thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock, and put \add it\add* upon the horns of the altar with thy finger, and pour all the blood beside the bottom of the altar. 
\v 13 And thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul \add that is\add* above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that \add is\add* upon them, and burn \add them\add* upon the altar. 
\v 14 But the flesh of the bullock, and his skin, and his dung shalt thou burn with fire without the camp: it \add is\add* a sin-offering. 
\v 15 Thou shalt also take one ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram. 
\v 16 And thou shalt slay the ram, and thou shalt take his blood, and sprinkle \add it\add* around upon the altar. 
\v 17 And thou shalt cut the ram in pieces, and wash the inwards of him, and his legs, and put \add them\add* to his pieces, and to his head. 
\v 18 And thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar: it \add is\add* a burnt-offering to the LORD: it \add is\add* a sweet savor, an offering made by fire to the LORD. 
\v 19 And thou shalt take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram. 
\v 20 Then shalt thou kill the ram, and take of his blood, and put \add it\add* upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and upon the tip of the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot, and sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about. 
\v 21 And thou shalt take of the blood that \add is\add* upon the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle \add it\add* upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him: and he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons garments with him. 
\v 22 Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul \add above\add* the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that \add is\add* upon them, and the right shoulder; for it \add is\add* a ram of consecration: 
\v 23 And one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer out of the basket of the unleavened bread, that \add is\add* before the LORD. 
\v 24 And thou shalt put all in the hands of Aaron, and in the hands of his sons; and shalt wave them \add for\add* a wave-offering before the LORD. 
\v 25 And thou shalt receive them from their hands, and burn \add them\add* upon the altar for a burnt-offering, for a sweet savor before the LORD: it \add is\add* an offering made by fire to the LORD. 
\v 26 And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron's consecration, and wave it \add for\add* a wave-offering before the LORD: and it shall be thy part. 
\v 27 And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave-offering, and the shoulder of the heave-offering, which is waved, and which is heaved up of the ram of the consecration, \add even\add* of \add that\add* which \add is\add* for Aaron, and of \add that\add* which is for his sons: 
\v 28 And it shall be Aaron's and his sons' by a statute for ever, from the children of Israel: for it \add is\add* a heave-offering: and it shall be a heave-offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifice of their peace-offerings, \add even\add* their heave-offering to the LORD. 
\v 29 And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons' after him, to be anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them. 
\v 30  \add And\add* that son, that is priest in his stead, shall put them on seven days, when he cometh into the tabernacle of the congregation to minister in the holy \add place\add*. 
\v 31 And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and seethe his flesh in the holy place. 
\v 32 And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that \add is\add* in the basket, \add by\add* the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
\v 33 And they shall eat those things with which the atonement was made, to consecrate \add and\add* to sanctify them: but a stranger shall not eat \add of them\add*, because they \add are\add* holy. 
\v 34 And if aught of the flesh of the consecration, or of the bread, shall remain till the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it \add is\add* holy. 
\v 35 And thus shalt thou do to Aaron, and to his sons, according to all \add things\add* which I have commanded thee: seven days shalt thou consecrate them. 
\v 36 And thou shalt offer every day a bullock \add for\add* a sin-offering for atonement; and thou shalt cleanse the altar, when thou hast made an atonement for it, and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it. 
\v 37 Seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar, and sanctify it; and it shall be an altar most holy: whatever toucheth the altar shall be holy. 
\v 38 Now this \add is that\add* which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two lambs of the first year, day by day continually. 
\v 39 The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb thou shalt offer at evening. 
\v 40 And with the one lamb a tenth-portion of flour mingled with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of a hin of wine \add for\add* a drink-offering. 
\v 41 And the other lamb thou shalt offer at evening, and shalt do thereto according to the meat-offering of the morning, and according to the drink-offering thereof, for a sweet savor, an offering made by fire to the LORD. 
\v 42  \add This shall be\add* a continual burnt-offering throughout your generations \add at\add* the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD: where I will meet you to speak there to thee. 
\v 43 And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and \add the tabernacle\add* shall be sanctified by my glory. 
\v 44 And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar: I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to minister to me in the priest's office. 
\v 45 And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God. 
\v 46 And they shall know that I \add am\add* the LORD their God, that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them: I \add am\add* the LORD their God. 
\c 30  
\p
\v 1 And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: \add of\add* shittim wood shalt thou make it. 
\v 2 A cubit \add shall be\add* its length, and a cubit its breadth; foursquare shall it be; and two cubits \add shall be\add* its hight: its horns \add shall be\add* of the same. 
\v 3 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, its top, and its sides round about, and its horns; and thou shalt make to it a crown of gold round about. 
\v 4 And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of it, by its two corners, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make \add it\add*; and they shall be for places for the staffs to bear it with. 
\v 5 And thou shalt make the staffs of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold. 
\v 6 And thou shalt put it before the vail that \add is\add* by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy-seat that \add is\add* over the testimony, where I will meet with thee. 
\v 7 And Aaron shall burn upon it sweet incense every morning: when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it. 
\v 8 And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at evening, he shall burn incense upon it; a perpetual incense before the LORD, throughout your generations. 
\v 9 Ye shall offer no strange incense upon it, nor burnt-sacrifice, nor meat-offering; neither shall ye pour drink-offering upon it. 
\v 10 And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a year, with the blood of the sin-offering of atonements: once in a year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your generations: it \add is\add* most holy to the LORD. 
\v 11 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 12 When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul to the LORD, when thou numberest them: that there may be no plague among them, when \add thou\add* numberest them. 
\v 13 This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are numbered, half a shekel, after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a shekel \add is\add* twenty gerahs:) a half shekel \add shall be\add* the offering of the LORD. 
\v 14 Every one that passeth among them that are numbered from twenty years old and above, shall give an offering to the LORD. 
\v 15 The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when \add they\add* give an offering to the LORD to make an atonement for your souls. 
\v 16 And thou shalt take the atonement-money of the children of Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; that it may be a memorial to the children of Israel before the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls. 
\v 17 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 18 Thou shalt also make a laver \add of\add* brass, and its foot \add also of\add* brass, to wash \add in\add* : \add and\add* thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein. 
\v 19 For Aaron and their sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat: 
\v 20 When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash with water, that they die not: or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire to the LORD. 
\v 21 So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, \add even\add* to him and to his seed throughout their generations. 
\v 22 Moreover the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 23 Take thou also to thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred \add shekels\add* , and of sweet cinnamon half as much, \add even\add* two hundred and fifty \add shekels\add* , and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty \add shekels\add* , 
\v 24 And of cassia five hundred \add shekels\add* , after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of olive-oil a hin: 
\v 25 And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment compound after the art of the apothecary: it shall be a holy anointing oil. 
\v 26 And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation with it, and the ark of the testimony, 
\v 27 And the table and all its vessels, and the candlestick and its vessels, and the altar of incense, 
\v 28 And the altar of burnt-offering with all its vessels, and the laver and its foot. 
\v 29 And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy: whatever toucheth them shall be holy. 
\v 30 And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, that \add they\add* may minister to me in the priest's office. 
\v 31 And thou shalt speak to the children of Israel, saying, This shall be a holy anointing oil to me, throughout your generations. 
\v 32 Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make \add any other\add* like it, after the composition of it: it \add is\add* holy, \add and\add* it shall be holy to you. 
\v 33 Whoever compoundeth \add any\add* like it, or whoever putteth \add any\add* of it upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people. 
\v 34 And the LORD said to Moses, Take to thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; \add these\add* sweet spices with pure frankincense: of each shall there be a like \add weight\add* : 
\v 35 And thou shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art of the apothecary, tempered together, pure \add and\add* holy: 
\v 36 And thou shalt beat \add some\add* of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation, where I will meet with thee: it shall be to you most holy: 
\v 37 And \add as for\add* the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make to yourselves according to its composition: it shall be to thee holy for the LORD. 
\v 38 Whoever shall make the like to that, to smell thereto, shall even be cut off from his people. 
\c 31  
\p
\v 1 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 2 See, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah: 
\v 3 And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship, 
\v 4 To devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, 
\v 5 And in cutting of stones to set \add them\add* , and in carving of timber, to work in all manner of workmanship. 
\v 6 And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab the son of Ahisamach of the tribe of Dan; and in the hearts of all that are wise-hearted I have put wisdom; that they may make all that I have commanded thee: 
\v 7 The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy-seat that \add is\add* upon it, and all the furniture of the tabernacle, 
\v 8 And the table and its furniture, and the pure candlestick with all its furniture, and the altar of incense, 
\v 9 And the altar of burnt-offering, with all its furniture, and the laver and its foot, 
\v 10 And the clothes of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office, 
\v 11 And the anointing oil, and sweet incense for the holy \add place\add* : according to all that I have commanded thee, shall they do. 
\v 12 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 13 Speak thou also to the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it \add is\add* a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that \add ye\add* may know that I \add am\add* the LORD that doth sanctify you. 
\v 14 Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore: for it \add is\add* holy to you. Every one that profaneth it shall surely be put to death: for whoever doeth \add any\add* work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people. 
\v 15 Six days may work be done, but in the seventh \add is\add* the sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD: whoever doeth \add any\add* work in the sabbath-day, he shall surely be put to death. 
\v 16 Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, \add for\add* a perpetual covenant. 
\v 17  \add It is\add* a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for \add in\add* six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested and was refreshed. 
\v 18 And to Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, he gave two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God. 
\c 32  
\p
\v 1 And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mount, the people assembled themselves to Aaron, and said to him, Arise, make us gods which shall go before us: for \add as for\add* this Moses, the man that brought us out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him. 
\v 2 And Aaron said to them, Break off the golden ear-rings which \add are\add* in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring \add them\add* to me. 
\v 3 And all the people broke off the golden ear-rings which \add were\add* in their ears, and brought \add them\add* to Aaron. 
\v 4 And he received \add them\add* at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These are thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt. 
\v 5 And when Aaron saw \add it\add* , he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To-morrow \add is\add* a feast to the LORD. 
\v 6 And they rose early on the morrow, and offered burnt-offerings, and brought peace-offerings: and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play. 
\v 7 And the LORD said to Moses, Go, go down; for thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted \add themselves\add* : 
\v 8 They have turned aside quickly from the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshiped it, and have sacrificed to it, and said, These are thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt. 
\v 9 And the LORD said to Moses, I have seen this people, and behold it \add is\add* a stiff-necked people: 
\v 10 Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation. 
\v 11 And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth from the land of Egypt, with great power, and with a mighty hand? 
\v 12 Why should the Egyptians speak and say, For evil did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people. 
\v 13 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel thy servants, to whom thou sworest by thine own self, and saidst to them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give to your seed, and they shall inherit \add it\add* for ever. 
\v 14 And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do to his people. 
\v 15 And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony \add were\add* in his hand: the tables \add were\add* written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other \add were\add* they written. 
\v 16 And the tables \add were\add* the work of God, and the writing \add was\add* the writing of God, graven upon the tables. 
\v 17 And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, \add There is\add* a noise of war in the camp. 
\v 18 And he said, \add It is\add* not the voice of \add them that\add* shout for mastery, neither \add is it\add* the voice of \add them that\add* cry for being overcome: \add but\add* the noise of \add them that\add* sing do I hear. 
\v 19 And it came to pass as soon as he came nigh to the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses's anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables from his hands, and broke them beneath the mount. 
\v 20 And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt \add it\add* in the fire, and ground \add it\add* to powder, and strewed \add it\add* upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink \add of it\add* . 
\v 21 And Moses said to Aaron, What did this people to thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them? 
\v 22 And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people that they \add are set\add* on mischief. 
\v 23 For they said to me, Make us gods which shall go before us: for \add as for\add* this Moses, the man that brought us out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him. 
\v 24 And I said to them, Whoever hath any gold, let them break \add it\add* off: So they gave \add it\add* to me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf. 
\v 25 And when Moses saw that the people \add were\add* naked (for Aaron had made them naked to \add their\add* shame, among their enemies:) 
\v 26 Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who \add is\add* on the LORD'S side? \add let him come\add* to me. And all the sons of Levi assembled themselves to him. 
\v 27 And he said to them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, \add and\add* go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor. 
\v 28 And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men. 
\v 29 For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves to-day to the LORD, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day. 
\v 30 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said to the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up to the LORD; it may be I shall make an atonement for your sin. 
\v 31 And Moses returned to the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold. 
\v 32 Yet now, if thou wilt, forgive their sin: and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written. 
\v 33 And the LORD said to Moses, Whoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book. 
\v 34 Therefore now go, lead the people to \add the place\add* of which I have spoken to thee: Behold, my angel shall go before thee: Nevertheless, in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin upon them. 
\v 35 And the LORD afflicted the people, because they made the calf which Aaron made. 
\c 33  
\p
\v 1 And the LORD said to Moses, Depart \add and\add* go up hence, thou and the people which thou hast conducted from the land of Egypt, to the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, to thy seed will I give it: 
\v 2 And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: 
\v 3 To a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou \add art\add* a stiff-necked people: lest I consume thee in the way. 
\v 4 And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man put on him his ornaments. 
\v 5 For the LORD had said to Moses, Say to the children of Israel, Ye \add are\add* a stiff-necked people: I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do to thee. 
\v 6 And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments, by the mount Horeb. 
\v 7 And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp far from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, \add that\add* every one who sought the LORD, went out to the tabernacle of the congregation, which \add was\add* without the camp. 
\v 8 And it came to pass when Moses went out to the tabernacle, \add that\add* all the people rose, and stood every man at his tent-door, and looked after Moses, until he had gone into the tabernacle. 
\v 9 And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood \add at\add* the door of the tabernacle, and \add the LORD\add* talked with Moses. 
\v 10 And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand \add at\add* the tabernacle door: and all the people rose and worshiped, every man \add in\add* his tent-door. 
\v 11 And the LORD spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaketh to his friend. And he turned again into the camp; but his servant Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle. 
\v 12 And Moses said to the LORD, See, thou sayest to me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight. 
\v 13 Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, show me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation \add is\add* thy people. 
\v 14 And he said, My presence shall attend \add thee\add* , and I will give thee rest. 
\v 15 And he said to him, If thy presence shall not attend me, conduct us not hence. 
\v 16 For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? \add Is it\add* not in that thou goest with us? So shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that \add are\add* upon the face of the earth. 
\v 17 And the LORD said to Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name. 
\v 18 And he said, I beseech thee, show me thy glory. 
\v 19 And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy. 
\v 20 And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live. 
\v 21 And the LORD said, Behold, \add there is\add* a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock: 
\v 22 And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a cleft of the rock: and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by: 
\v 23 And I will take away my hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen. 
\c 34  
\p
\v 1 And the LORD said to Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like the first; and I will write upon \add these\add* tables the words that were in the first tables which thou didst break. 
\v 2 And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning to mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me on the top of the mount. 
\v 3 And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount: neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount. 
\v 4 And he hewed two tables of stone, like the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up to mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone. 
\v 5 And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD. 
\v 6 And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth. 
\v 7 Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear \add the guilty\add* ; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, to the third and to the fourth \add generation\add* . 
\v 8 And Moses made haste, and bowed his head towards the earth, and worshiped. 
\v 9 And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O LORD, let my Lord, I pray thee, go among us (for it \add is\add* a stiff-necked people) and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thy inheritance. 
\v 10 And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do wonders, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which thou \add art\add* , shall see the work of the LORD: for it \add is\add* a terrible thing that I will do with thee. 
\v 11 Observe thou that which I command thee this day: Behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite. 
\v 12 Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee: 
\v 13 But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves. 
\v 14 For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name \add is\add* Jealous, \add is\add* a jealous God: 
\v 15 Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go astray after their gods, and do sacrifice to their gods, and \add one\add* call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice; 
\v 16 And thou take of their daughters to thy sons, and their daughters go astray after their gods, and make thy sons go astray after their gods. 
\v 17 Thou shalt make thee no molten gods. 
\v 18 The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time of the month Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out of from Egypt. 
\v 19 Every first-born \add is\add* mine: and every firstling among thy cattle, \add whether\add* ox or sheep, \add that is male\add* . 
\v 20 But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou shalt not redeem him, then shalt thou break his neck. All the first-born of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me empty. 
\v 21 Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in time of plowing and in harvest thou shalt rest. 
\v 22 And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the first-fruits of wheat-harvest, and the feast of in-gathering at the year's end. 
\v 23 Thrice in the year shall all your male children appear before the LORD GOD, the God of Israel. 
\v 24 For I will drive out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go up to appear before the LORD thy God, thrice in the year. 
\v 25 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven, neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left until the morning. 
\v 26 The first of the first-fruits of thy land thou shalt bring to the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk. 
\v 27 And the LORD said to Moses, Write thou these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee, and with Israel. 
\v 28 And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he neither ate bread nor drank water: and he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments. 
\v 29 And it came to pass when Moses came down from mount Sinai (with the two tables of testimony in Moses's hand, when he came down from the mount) that Moses knew not that the skin of his face shone, while he talked with him. 
\v 30 And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone, and they were afraid to come nigh him. 
\v 31 And Moses called to them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned to him; and Moses talked with them. 
\v 32 And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount Sinai. 
\v 33 And \add till\add* Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his face. 
\v 34 But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he took the vail off, until he came out. And he came out and spoke to the children of Israel \add that\add* which he was commanded. 
\v 35 And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses's face shone: and Moses put the vail upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him. 
\c 35  
\p
\v 1 And Moses assembled all the congregation of the children of Israel, and said to them, These \add are\add* the words which the LORD hath commanded, that \add ye\add* should do them. 
\v 2 Six days shall work be done; but on the seventh day there shall be to you a holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD: whoever doth work therein shall be put to death. 
\v 3 Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath-day. 
\v 4 And Moses spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, This \add is\add* the thing which the LORD commanded, saying, 
\v 5 Take ye from among you an offering to the LORD: whoever \add is\add* of a willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the LORD; gold, and silver, and brass, 
\v 6 And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' \add hair\add* , 
\v 7 And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood, 
\v 8 And oil for the light, and spices for anointing oil, and for the sweet incense, 
\v 9 And onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod, and for the breast-plate. 
\v 10 And every wise-hearted among you shall come, and make all that the LORD hath commanded; 
\v 11 The tabernacle, its tent, and its covering, its buttons, and its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets, 
\v 12 The ark, and its staffs, \add with\add* the mercy-seat, and the vail of the covering, 
\v 13 The table, and its staffs, and all its vessels, and the show-bread, 
\v 14 The candlestick also for the light, and its furniture, and its lamps, with the oil for the light, 
\v 15 And the incense-altar, and its staffs, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the door at the entrance of the tabernacle, 
\v 16 The altar of burnt-offering, with its brazen grate, its staffs, and all its vessels, the laver and its foot, 
\v 17 The hangings of the court, its pillars, and their sockets, and the hanging for the door of the court, 
\v 18 The pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords, 
\v 19 The clothes of service, to do service in the holy \add place\add* , the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office. 
\v 20 And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses. 
\v 21 And they came, every one whose heart excited him, and every one whom his spirit made willing, \add and\add* they brought the LORD'S offering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation, and for all his service, and for the holy garments. 
\v 22 And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing-hearted, \add and\add* brought bracelets, and ear-rings, and rings, and tablets, all jewels of gold; and every man that offered, \add offered\add* an offering of gold to the LORD. 
\v 23 And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' \add hair\add* , and red skins of rams, and badgers' skins, brought \add them\add* . 
\v 24 Every one that offered an offering of silver and brass brought the LORD'S offering: and every man with whom was found shittim wood for any work of the service, brought \add it\add* . 
\v 25 And all the women that were wise-hearted spun with their hands, and brought that which they had spun, \add both\add* of blue, and of purple, \add and\add* of scarlet, and of fine linen. 
\v 26 And all the women whose heart moved them in wisdom spun goats' \add hair\add* . 
\v 27 And the rulers brought onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breast-plate; 
\v 28 And spice, and oil for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense. 
\v 29 The children of Israel brought a willing offering to the LORD, every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work, which the LORD had commanded to be made by the hand of Moses. 
\v 30 And Moses said to the children of Israel, See, the LORD hath called by name Bezaleel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah; 
\v 31 And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship; 
\v 32 And to devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, 
\v 33 And in the cutting of stones, to set \add them\add* , and in carving of wood, to make any manner of curious work. 
\v 34 And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, \add both\add* he and Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. 
\v 35 Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of work, of the engraver, and of the skillful workmen, and of the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, \add even\add* of them that do any work, and of those that devise curious work. 
\c 36  
\p
\v 1 Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise-hearted man, in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding, to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that the LORD had commanded. 
\v 2 And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise-hearted man, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, \add even\add* every one whose heart excited him to come to the work to do it: 
\v 3 And they received from Moses all the offering which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it. And they brought yet to him free-offerings every morning. 
\v 4 And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they made. 
\v 5 And they spoke to Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work, which the LORD commanded to make. 
\v 6 And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing. 
\v 7 For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much. 
\v 8 And every wise-hearted man among them that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains \add of\add* fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: he made them \add with\add* cherubim of curious work. 
\v 9 The length of one curtain \add was\add* twenty and eight cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains \add were\add* all of one size. 
\v 10 And he coupled the five curtains one to another: and \add the other\add* five curtains he coupled one to another. 
\v 11 And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the extremity of \add another\add* curtain, in the coupling of the second. 
\v 12 Fifty loops he made in one curtain, and fifty loops he made in the edge of the curtain which \add was\add* in the coupling of the second: the loops held one \add curtain\add* to another. 
\v 13 And he made fifty buttons of gold, and coupled the curtains one to another with the buttons. So it became one tabernacle. 
\v 14 And he made curtains \add of\add* goats' \add hair\add* for the tent over the tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them. 
\v 15 The length of one curtain \add was\add* thirty cubits, and four cubits \add was\add* the breadth of one curtain: the eleven curtains \add were\add* of one size. 
\v 16 And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves. 
\v 17 And he made fifty loops upon the outermost edge of the curtain in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second. 
\v 18 And he made fifty buttons \add of\add* brass to couple the tent together, that it might be one. 
\v 19 And he made a covering for the tent \add of\add* rams' skins dyed red, and a covering \add of\add* badgers' skins above \add that\add* . 
\v 20 And he made boards for the tabernacle \add of\add* shittim wood, standing up. 
\v 21 The length of a board \add was\add* ten cubits, and the breadth of a board one cubit and a half. 
\v 22 One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another; thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle. 
\v 23 And he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the south side southward: 
\v 24 And forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for its two tenons, and two sockets under another board for its two tenons. 
\v 25 And for the other side of the tabernacle \add which is\add* towards the north corner, he made twenty boards. 
\v 26 And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board. 
\v 27 And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards. 
\v 28 And two boards he made for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides. 
\v 29 And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the head thereof, to one ring: thus he did to both of them in both the corners. 
\v 30 And there were eight boards; and their sockets \add were\add* sixteen sockets of silver, under every board two sockets. 
\v 31 And he made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle, 
\v 32 And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the sides westward. 
\v 33 And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the one end to the other. 
\v 34 And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings \add of\add* gold \add to be\add* places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold. 
\v 35 And he made a vail \add of\add* blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: \add with\add* cherubim he made it of curious work. 
\v 36 And he made to it four pillars \add of\add* shittim \add wood\add* , and overlaid them with gold: their hooks \add were of\add* gold; and he cast for them four sockets of silver. 
\v 37 And he made a hanging for the tabernacle-door \add of\add* blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, of needle-work; 
\v 38 And the five pillars of it, with their hooks: and he overlaid their capitals and their fillets with gold: but their five sockets \add were of\add* brass. 
\c 37  
\p
\v 1 And Bezaleel made the ark \add of\add* shittim wood: two cubits and a half \add was\add* the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth of it, and a cubit and a half the hight of it: 
\v 2 And he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made a crown of gold to it round about. 
\v 3 And he cast for it four rings of gold, \add to be set\add* by the four corners of it; even two rings upon the one side of it, and two rings upon the other side of it. 
\v 4 And he made staffs \add of\add* shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold. 
\v 5 And he put the staffs into the rings by the sides of the ark, to bear the ark. 
\v 6 And he made the mercy-seat \add of\add* pure gold: two cubits and a half \add was\add* the length of it, and one cubit and a half the breadth of it. 
\v 7 And he made two cherubim \add of\add* gold, beaten out of one piece he made them, on the two ends of the mercy-seat; 
\v 8 One cherub on the end on this side, and another cherub on the \add other\add* end on that side: out of the mercy-seat made he the cherubim on the two ends of it. 
\v 9 And the cherubim spread out \add their\add* wings on high, \add and\add* covered with their wings over the mercy-seat, with their faces one to another; \add even\add* towards the mercy-seat were the faces of the cherubim. 
\v 10 And he made the table \add of\add* shittim wood: two cubits \add was\add* its length, and a cubit its breadth, and a cubit and a half its hight: 
\v 11 And he overlaid it with pure gold, and made to it a crown of gold round about. 
\v 12 Also he made to it a border of a hand-breadth round about; and made a crown of gold for its border round about. 
\v 13 And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings upon the four corners that \add were\add* in its four feet. 
\v 14 Over against the border were the rings, the places for the staffs, to bear the table. 
\v 15 And he made the staffs \add of\add* shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold, to bear the table. 
\v 16 And he made the vessels which \add were\add* upon the table, its dishes, and its spoons, and its bowls, and its covers to cover with, \add of\add* pure gold. 
\v 17 And he made the candlestick of pure gold; \add of\add* beaten work he made the candlestick; its shaft, and its branch, its bowls, its knobs, and its flowers were of the same: 
\v 18 And six branches proceeding from its sides; three branches of the candlestick from the one side of it, and three branches of the candlestick from the other side of it. 
\v 19 Three bowls made after the fashion of almonds in one branch, a knob and a flower; and three bowls made like almonds in another branch, a knob and a flower: so throughout the six branches proceeding from the candlestick. 
\v 20 And in the candlestick \add were\add* four bowls made like almonds, its knobs, and its flowers: 
\v 21 And a knob under two branches of the same, and a knob under two branches of the same, and a knob under two branches of the same, according to the six branches proceeding from it. 
\v 22 Their knobs and their branches were of the same: all of it \add was\add* one beaten work \add of\add* pure gold. 
\v 23 And he made its seven lamps, and its snuffers, and its snuff-dishes, \add of\add* pure gold. 
\v 24  \add Of\add* a talent of pure gold he made it, and all its vessels. 
\v 25 And he made the incense-altar \add of\add* shittim wood: the length of it \add was\add* a cubit, and the breadth of it a cubit; \add it was\add* foursquare; and two cubits \add was\add* the hight of it; the horns of it were of the same. 
\v 26 And he overlaid it with pure gold, \add both\add* the top of it, and its sides round about, and its horns: also he made to it a crown of gold round about. 
\v 27 And he made two rings of gold for it under its crown, by the two corners of it, upon its two sides, to be places for the staffs to bear it with. 
\v 28 And he made the staffs \add of\add* shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold. 
\v 29 And he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure incense of sweet spices, according to the work of the apothecary. 
\c 38  
\p
\v 1 And he made the altar of burnt-offering \add of\add* shittim wood: five cubits \add was\add* the length of it, and five cubits the breadth of it; \add it was\add* foursquare; and its hight was three cubits. 
\v 2 And he made its horns on the four corners of it; its horns were of the same: and he overlaid it with brass. 
\v 3 And he made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, and the shovels, and the basins, \add and\add* the flesh-hooks, and the fire-pans: all the vessels of it he made \add of\add* brass. 
\v 4 And he made for the altar a brazen grate of net-work under the compass of it beneath to the midst of it. 
\v 5 And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grate of brass, \add to be\add* places for the staffs. 
\v 6 And he made the staffs \add of\add* shittim wood, and overlaid them with brass. 
\v 7 And he put the staffs into the rings on the sides of the altar, to bear it with; he made the altar hollow with boards. 
\v 8 And he made the laver \add of\add* brass, and the foot of it \add of\add* brass, of the looking-glasses of \add the women\add* assembling, who assembled \add at\add* the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
\v 9 And he made the court: on the south side southward the hangings of the court \add were of\add* fine twined linen, a hundred cubits: 
\v 10 Their pillars \add were\add* twenty, and their brazen sockets twenty; the hooks of the pillars, and their fillets, \add were of\add* silver. 
\v 11 And for the north side, \add the hangings were\add* a hundred cubits, their pillars \add were\add* twenty, and their sockets of brass twenty: the hooks of the pillars, and their filets, \add of\add* silver.

\v 19 And their pillars \add were\add* four, and their sockets \add of\add* brass four; their hooks \add of\add* silver, and the overlaying of their capitals and their fillets \add of\add* silver. 
\v 20 And all the pins of the tabernacle, and of the court round about, \add were of\add* brass. 
\v 21 This is the sum of the tabernacle, \add even\add* of the tabernacle of testimony, as it was counted, according to the commandment of Moses, \add for\add* the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, son to Aaron the priest. 
\v 22 And Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that the LORD commanded Moses. 
\v 23 And with him \add was\add* Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver, and a skillful workman, and an embroiderer in blue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen. 
\v 24 All the gold that was occupied for the work in all the work of the holy \add place\add* , even the gold of the offering, was twenty and nine talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary. 
\v 25 And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation \add was\add* a hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and seventy five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary: 
\v 26 A bekah for every man, \add that is\add* , half a shekel, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for every one that went to be numbered, from twenty years old and upward, for six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty \add men\add* . 
\v 27 And of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of the sanctuary, and the sockets of the vail; a hundred sockets of the hundred talents, a talent for a socket. 
\v 28 And of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five \add shekels\add* he made hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their capitals, and filleted them. 
\v 29 And the brass of the offering \add was\add* seventy talents, and two thousand and four hundred shekels. 
\v 30 And with this he made the sockets to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the brazen altar, and the brazen grate for it, and all the vessels of the altar, 
\v 31 And the sockets of the court round about, and the sockets of the court gate, and all the pins of the tabernacle, and all the pins of the court round about. 
\c 39  
\p
\v 1 And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made clothes of service, to do service in the holy \add place\add* , and made the holy garments for Aaron; as the LORD commanded Moses. 
\v 2 And he made the ephod \add of\add* gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen. 
\v 3 And they beat the gold into thin plates, and cut \add it into\add* wires, to work \add it\add* in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the fine linen, \add with\add* curious work. 
\v 4 They made shoulder-pieces for it, to couple \add it\add* together: by the two edges was it coupled together. 
\v 5 And the curious girdle of his ephod, that \add was\add* upon it, \add was\add* of the same, according to the work thereof; \add of\add* gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; as the LORD commanded Moses. 
\v 6 And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold, graven as signets are graven, with the names of the children of Israel. 
\v 7 And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, \add that they should be\add* stones for a memorial to the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses. 
\v 8 And he made the breast-plate \add of\add* curious work, like the work of the ephod; \add of\add* gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen. 
\v 9 It was foursquare; they made the breast-plate double: a span \add was\add* the length of it, and a span the breadth of it, \add being\add* doubled. 
\v 10 And they set in it four rows of stones: \add the first\add* row \add was\add* a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this \add was\add* the first row. 
\v 11 And the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond. 
\v 12 And the third row, a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst. 
\v 13 And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper: \add they were\add* inclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings. 
\v 14 And the stones \add were\add* according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names, \add like\add* the engravings of a signet, every one with his name, according to the twelve tribes. 
\v 15 And they made upon the breast-plate chains at the ends, \add of\add* wreathed work \add of\add* pure gold. 
\v 16 And they made two ouches \add of\add* gold, and two gold rings, and put the two rings in the two ends of the breast-plate. 
\v 17 And they put the two wreathed chains of gold in the two rings on the ends of the breast-plate. 
\v 18 And the two ends of the two wreathed chains they fastened in the two ouches, and put them on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, before it. 
\v 19 And they made two rings of gold, and put \add them\add* on the two ends of the breast-plate, upon the border of it, which \add was\add* on the side of the ephod inward. 
\v 20 And they made two \add other\add* golden rings, and put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, towards the forepart of it, over against the \add other\add* coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod: 
\v 21 And they bound the breast-plate by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breast-plate might not be loosed from the ephod; as the LORD commanded Moses. 
\v 22 And he made the robe of the ephod \add of\add* woven work, all \add of\add* blue. 
\v 23 And \add there was\add* a hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of an habergeon, \add with\add* a band around the hole, that it should not rend. 
\v 24 And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates \add of\add* blue, and purple, and scarlet, \add and\add* twined \add linen\add* . 
\v 25 And they made bells \add of\add* pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, around between the pomegranates; 
\v 26 A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, around the hem of the robe to minister \add in\add* ; as the LORD commanded Moses. 
\v 27 And they made coats \add of\add* fine linen, \add of\add* woven work, for Aaron and for his sons, 
\v 28 And a miter \add of\add* fine linen, and goodly bonnets \add of\add* fine linen, and linen breeches \add of\add* fine twined linen, 
\v 29 And a girdle \add of\add* fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, \add of\add* needle-work; as the LORD commanded Moses. 
\v 30 And they made the plate of the holy crown \add of\add* pure gold, and wrote upon it a writing, \add like to\add* the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD. 
\v 31 And they tied to it a lace of blue, to fasten \add it\add* on high upon the miter; as the LORD commanded Moses. 
\v 32 Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation finished: and the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they. 
\v 33 And they brought the tabernacle to Moses, the tent, and all its furniture, its buttons, its boards, its bars, and its pillars, and its sockets, 
\v 34 And the covering of rams' skins dyed red, and the covering of badgers' skins, and the vail of the covering, 
\v 35 The ark of the testimony, and its staffs, and the mercy-seat, 
\v 36 The table, \add and\add* all its vessels, and the show-bread, 
\v 37 The pure candlestick, \add with\add* its lamps, \add even with\add* the lamps to be set in order, and all its vessels, and the oil for light, 
\v 38 And the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the tabernacle-door, 
\v 39 The brazen altar, and its grate of brass, its staffs, and all its vessels, the laver and its foot, 
\v 40 The hangings of the court, its pillars, and its sockets, and the hanging for the court-gate, its cords, and its pins, and all the vessels of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of the congregation, 
\v 41 The clothes of service to do service in the holy \add place\add* , and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons' garments, to minister in the priest's office. 
\v 42 According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel made all the work. 
\v 43 And Moses looked upon all the work, and behold, they had done it as the LORD had commanded, even so had they done it: and Moses blessed them. 
\c 40  
\p
\v 1 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 2 On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation. 
\v 3 And thou shalt put in it the ark of the testimony, and cover the ark with the vail. 
\v 4 And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light its lamps. 
\v 5 And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle. 
\v 6 And thou shalt set the altar of the, burnt-offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation. 
\v 7 And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and shalt put water in it. 
\v 8 And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the hanging at the court-gate. 
\v 9 And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that \add is\add* in it, and shalt hallow it, and all its vessels: and it shall be holy. 
\v 10 And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt-offering and all its vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy. 
\v 11 And thou shalt anoint the laver and its foot, and sanctify it. 
\v 12 And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water. 
\v 13 And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and sanctify him; that he may minister to me in the priest's office. 
\v 14 And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats: 
\v 15 And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister to me in the priest's office: for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations. 
\v 16 Thus did Moses; according to all that the LORD commanded him, so did he. 
\v 17 And it came to pass in the first month, in the second year, on the first \add day\add* of the month, \add that\add* the tabernacle was reared up. 
\v 18 And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened its sockets, and set up its boards, and put in its bars, and reared up its pillars. 
\v 19 And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded Moses. 
\v 20 And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staffs on the ark, and put the mercy-seat above upon the ark: 
\v 21 And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded Moses. 
\v 22 And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail. 
\v 23 And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses. 
\v 24 And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward. 
\v 25 And he lighted the lamps before the LORD, as the LORD commanded Moses. 
\v 26 And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation, before the vail: 
\v 27 And he burnt sweet incense on it; as the LORD commanded Moses. 
\v 28 And he set up the hanging \add at\add* the door of the tabernacle. 
\v 29 And he put the altar of burnt-offering \add by\add* the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt-offering, and the meat-offering; as the LORD commanded Moses. 
\v 30 And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash \add with\add* . 
\v 31 And Moses, and Aaron, and his sons, washed their hands and their feet thereat: 
\v 32 When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near to the altar, they washed; as the LORD commanded Moses. 
\v 33 And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court-gate: so Moses finished the work. 
\v 34 Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. 
\v 35 And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode upon it, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. 
\v 36 And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys: 
\v 37 But if the cloud was not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up. 
\v 38 For the cloud of the LORD \add was\add* upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.
