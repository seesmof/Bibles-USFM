\mt1 THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE 
\c 1  
\p
\v 1 Forasmuch as many haue taken in hand to set foorth the storie of those things, whereof we are fully persuaded, 
\v 2 As they haue deliuered them vnto vs, which from the beginning saw them their selues, and were ministers of ye word, 
\v 3 It seemed good also to me (most noble Theophilus) assoone as I had searched out perfectly all things from the beginning, to write vnto thee thereof from point to point, 
\v 4 That thou mightest acknowledge the certaintie of those things, whereof thou hast bene instructed. 
\v 5 In the time of Herod King of Iudea, there was a certaine Priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabet. 
\v 6 Both were iust before God, and walked in all the commandements and ordinances of the Lord, without reproofe. 
\v 7 And they had no childe, because that Elisabet was barren: and both were well stricken in age. 
\v 8 And it came to passe, as he executed the Priestes office before God, as his course came in order, 
\v 9 According to the custome of the Priests office, his lot was to burne incense, when he went into the Temple of the Lord. 
\v 10 And the whole multitude of the people were without in prayer, while the incense was burning. 
\v 11 Then appeared vnto him an Angel of the Lord standing at the right side of the altar of incense. 
\v 12 And when Zacharias sawe him, he was troubled, and feare fell vpon him. 
\v 13 But the Angel saide vnto him, Feare not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard, and thy wise Elisabet shall beare thee a sonne, and thou shalt call his name Iohn. 
\v 14 And thou shalt haue ioy and gladnes, and many shall reioyce at his birth. 
\v 15 For he shalbe great in the sight of the Lord, and shall neither drinke wine, nor strong drinke: and he shalbe filled with the holy Ghost, euen from his mothers wombe. 
\v 16 And many of the children of Israel shall he turne to their Lord God. 
\v 17 For he shall goe before him in the spirite and power of Elias, to turne the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisedome of the iust men, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord. 
\v 18 Then Zacharias said vnto ye Angel, Whereby shall I knowe this? for I am an olde man, and my wife is of a great age. 
\v 19 And the Angell answered, and sayde vnto him, I am Gabriel that stand in the presence of God, and am sent to speake vnto thee, and to shew thee these good tidings. 
\v 20 And beholde, thou shalt be domme, and not be able to speake, vntill the day that these things be done, because thou beleeuedst not my words, which shalbe fulfilled in their season. 
\v 21 Now the people waited for Zacharias, and marueiled that he taried so long in the Temple. 
\v 22 And when hee came out, hee coulde not speake vnto them: then they perceiued that hee had seene a vision in the Temple: For he made signes vnto them, and remained domme. 
\v 23 And it came to passe, when the daies of his office were fulfilled, that he departed to his owne house. 
\v 24 And after those daies, his wife Elisabet conceiued, and hid her selfe fiue moneths, saying, 
\v 25 Thus hath the Lord dealt with me, in the daies wherein he looked on me, to take from me my rebuke among men. 
\v 26 And in the sixth moneth, the Angell Gabriel was sent from God vnto a citie of Galile, named Nazareth, 
\v 27 To a virgin affianced to a man whose name was Ioseph, of the house of Dauid, and the virgins name was Marie. 
\v 28 And the Angel went in vnto her, and said, Haile thou that art freely beloued: the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women. 
\v 29 And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and thought what maner of salutation that should be. 
\v 30 Then the Angel saide vnto her, Feare not, Marie: for thou hast found fauour with God. 
\v 31 For loe, thou shalt conceiue in thy wobe, and beare a sonne, and shalt call his name Iesus. 
\v 32 He shall be great, and shall be called the Sonne of the most High, and the Lord God shall giue vnto him the throne of his father Dauid. 
\v 33 And hee shall reigne ouer the house of Iacob for euer, and of his kingdome shall bee none ende. 
\v 34 Then sayde Marie vnto the Angel, How shall this be, seeing I knowe not man? 
\v 35 And the Angel answered, and said vnto her, The holy Ghost shall come vpon thee, and the power of the most High shall ouershadowe thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall bee borne of thee, shall be called the Sonne of God. 
\v 36 And behold, thy cousin Elisabet, she hath also conceiued a sonne in her olde age: and this is her sixt moneth, which was called barren. 
\v 37 For with God shall nothing be vnpossible. 
\v 38 Then Marie said, Behold the seruant of the Lord: be it vnto me according to thy woorde. So the Angel departed from her. 
\v 39 And Marie arose in those daies, and went into ye hil countrey with hast to a citie of Iuda, 
\v 40 And entred into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabet. 
\v 41 And it came to passe, as Elisabet heard the salutation of Marie, the babe sprang in her bellie, and Elisabet was filled with the holy Ghost. 
\v 42 And she cried with a loud voice, and saide, Blessed art thou among women, because the fruit of thy wombe is blessed. 
\v 43 And whence commeth this to mee, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? 
\v 44 For loe, assoone as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine eares, the babe sprang in my bellie for ioye, 
\v 45 And blessed is shee that beleeued: for those things shall be perfourmed, which were tolde her from the Lord. 
\v 46 Then Marie sayde, My soule magnifieth the Lord, 
\v 47 And my spirite reioyceth in God my Sauiour. 
\v 48 For hee hath looked on the poore degree of his seruaunt: for beholde, from henceforth shall all ages call me blessed, 
\v 49 Because hee that is mightie, hath done for me great things, and holy is his Name. 
\v 50 And his mercie is from generation to generation on them that feare him. 
\v 51 Hee hath shewed strength with his arme: hee hath scattered the proude in the imagination of their hearts. 
\v 52 Hee hath put downe the mighty from their seates, and exalted them of lowe degree. 
\v 53 Hee hath filled the hungrie with good things, and sent away the rich emptie. 
\v 54 Hee hath vpholden Israel his seruaunt to be mindefull of his mercie 
\v 55 (As hee hath spoken to our fathers, to wit, to Abraham, and his seede) for euer. 
\v 56 And Marie abode with her about three moneths: after, shee returned to her owne house. 
\v 57 Nowe Elisabets time was fulfilled, that shee should be deliuered, and shee brought foorth a sonne. 
\v 58 And her neighbours, and cousins heard tell howe the Lord had shewed his great mercie vpon her, and they reioyced with her. 
\v 59 And it was so that on the eight day they came to circumcise the babe, and called him Zacharias after the name of his father. 
\v 60 But his mother answered, and saide, Not so, but he shalbe called Iohn. 
\v 61 And they saide vnto her, There is none of thy kindred, that is named with this name. 
\v 62 Then they made signes to his father, howe he would haue him called. 
\v 63 So hee asked for writing tables, and wrote, saying, His name is Iohn, and they marueiled all. 
\v 64 And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue, and he spake and praised God. 
\v 65 Then feare came on all them that dwelt neere vnto them, and all these woordes were noised abroade throughout all the hill countrey of Iudea. 
\v 66 And al they that heard them, laid them vp in their hearts, saying, What maner childe shall this be! and the hand of the Lord was with him. 
\v 67 Then his father Zacharias was filled with the holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying, 
\v 68 Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, because he hath visited and redeemed his people, 
\v 69 And hath raised vp the horne of saluation vnto vs, in the house of his seruant Dauid, 
\v 70 As he spake by ye mouth of his holy Prophets, which were since the world began, saying, 
\v 71 That he would sende vs deliuerance from our enemies, and from the hands of all that hate vs, 
\v 72 That he might shewe mercie towards our fathers, and remember his holy couenant, 
\v 73 And the othe which he sware to our father Abraham. 
\v 74 Which was, that he would graunt vnto vs, that we being deliuered out of the handes of our enemies, should serue him without feare, 
\v 75 All the daies of our life, in holinesse and righteousnesse before him. 
\v 76 And thou, babe, shalt be called the Prophet of the most High: for thou shalt goe before the face of the Lord, to prepare his waies, 
\v 77 And to giue knowledge of saluation vnto his people, by the remission of their sinnes, 
\v 78 Through ye tender mercy of our God, wherby the day spring from an hie hath visited vs, 
\v 79 To giue light to them that sit in darknes, and in the shadow of death, and to guide our feete into the way of peace. 
\v 80 And the childe grewe, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the wildernesse, til the day came that he should shewe him selfe vnto Israel. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 And it came to passe in those dayes, that there came a decree from Augustus Cesar, that all the world should be taxed. 
\v 2 (This first taxing was made when Cyrenius was gouernour of Syria.) 
\v 3 Therefore went all to be taxed, euery man to his owne Citie. 
\v 4 And Ioseph also went vp from Galile out of a citie called Nazareth, into Iudea, vnto the citie of Dauid, which is called Beth-leem (because he was of the house and linage of Dauid,) 
\v 5 To bee taxed with Marie that was giuen him to wife, which was with childe. 
\v 6 And so it was, that while they were there, the daies were accomplished that shee shoulde be deliuered, 
\v 7 And she brought foorth her first begotten sonne, and wrapped him in swadling clothes, and laide him in a cratch, because there was no roome for them in the ynne. 
\v 8 And there were in the same countrey shepheards, abiding in the fielde, and keeping watch by night ouer their flocke. 
\v 9 And loe, the Angel of the Lord came vpon them, and the glorie of the Lord shone about them, and they were sore afraide. 
\v 10 Then the Angel saide vnto them, Be not afraid: for behold, I bring you glad tidings of great ioy, that shalbe to all the people, 
\v 11 That is, that vnto you is borne this day in the citie of Dauid, a Sauiour, which is Christ the Lord. 
\v 12 And this shalbe a signe to you, Yee shall finde the babe swadled, and laid in a cratch. 
\v 13 And straightway there was with the Angel a multitude of heauenly souldiers, praising God, and saying, 
\v 14 Glory be to God in the high heauens, and peace in earth, and towards men good will. 
\v 15 And it came to passe whe the Angels were gone away from them into heauen, that the shepheards sayde one to another, Let vs goe then vnto Beth-leem, and see this thing that is come to passe which the Lord hath shewed vnto vs. 
\v 16 So they came with haste, and founde both Marie and Ioseph, and the babe laid in the cratch. 
\v 17 And when they had seene it, they published abroade the thing, that was tolde them of that childe. 
\v 18 And all that heard it, wondred at ye things which were tolde them of the shepheards. 
\v 19 But Mary kept all those sayings, and pondred them in her heart. 
\v 20 And the shepheardes returned glorifiyng and praising God, for all that they had heard and seene as it was spoken vnto them. 
\v 21 And when the eight daies were accomplished, that they shoulde circumcise the childe, his name was then called Iesus, which was named of the Angell, before he was conceiued in the wombe. 
\v 22 And when the daies of her purification after the Lawe of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Hierusalem, to present him to the Lord, 
\v 23 (As it is written in the Lawe of the Lord, Euery man childe that first openeth ye wombe, shalbe called holy to the Lord) 
\v 24 And to giue an oblation, as it is commanded in the Lawe of the Lord, a paire of turtle doues, or two yong pigeons. 
\v 25 And behold, there was a man in Hierusalem, whose name was Simeon: this man was iust, and feared God, and waited for the consolation of Israel, and the holy Ghost was vpon him. 
\v 26 And it was declared to him from God by the holy Ghost, that he shoulde not see death, before he had seene that Anointed of the Lord. 
\v 27 And he came by the motion of the spirit into the Temple, and when the parents brought in the babe Iesus, to do for him after the custome of the Lawe, 
\v 28 Then hee tooke him in his armes, and praised God, and sayd, 
\v 29 Lord, nowe lettest thou thy seruaunt depart in peace, according to thy woorde, 
\v 30 For mine eyes haue seene thy saluation, 
\v 31 Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people, 
\v 32 A light to be reueiled to the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel. 
\v 33 And Ioseph and his mother marueiled at those things, which were spoken touching him. 
\v 34 And Simeon blessed them, and saide vnto Mary his mother, Beholde, this childe is appointed for the fall and rising againe of many in Israel, and for a signe which shalbe spoken against, 
\v 35 (Yea and a sworde shall pearce through thy soule) that the thoughts of many heartes may be opened. 
\v 36 And there was a Prophetesse, one Anna the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser, which was of a great age, after she had liued with an husband seuen yeeres from her virginitie: 
\v 37 And she was widowe about foure score and foure yeeres, and went not out of the Temple, but serued God with fastings and prayers, night and day. 
\v 38 She then coming at the same instant vpon them, confessed likewise the Lord, and spake of him to all that looked for redemption in Hierusalem. 
\v 39 And when they had performed all thinges according to the lawe of the Lord, they returned into Galile to their owne citie Nazareth. 
\v 40 And the childe grewe, and waxed strong in Spirit, and was filled with wisedome, and the grace of God was with him. 
\v 41 Nowe his parents went to Hierusalem euery yeere, at the feast of the Passeouer. 
\v 42 And when hee was twelue yeere olde, and they were come vp to Hierusalem, after the custome of the feast, 
\v 43 And had finished the dayes thereof, as they returned, the childe Iesus remained in Hierusalem, and Ioseph knew not, nor his mother, 
\v 44 But they supposing, that he had bene in the company, went a dayes iourney, and sought him among their kinsfolke, and acquaintance. 
\v 45 And when they found him not, they turned backe to Hierusalem, and sought him. 
\v 46 And it came to passe three dayes after, that they found him in the Temple, sitting in the mids of the doctours, both hearing them, and asking them questions: 
\v 47 And all that heard him, were astonied at his vnderstanding and answeres. 
\v 48 So when they sawe him, they were amased, and his mother said vnto him, Sonne, why hast thou thus dealt with vs? beholde, thy father and I haue sought thee with very heauie hearts. 
\v 49 Then said he vnto them, Howe is it that ye sought me? knewe ye not that I must goe about my Fathers busines? 
\v 50 But they vnderstoode not the word that he spake to them. 
\v 51 Then hee went downe with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subiect to them: and his mother kept all these sayings in her heart. 
\v 52 And Iesus increased in wisedome, and stature, and in fauour with God and men. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 Nowe in the fifteenth yeere of the reigne of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being gouernour of Iudea, and Herod being Tetrarch of Galile, and his brother Philip Tetrarch of Iturea, and of the countrey of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the Tetrarch of Abilene, 
\v 2 (When Annas and Caiaphas were the hie Priestes) the worde of God came vnto Iohn, the sonne of Zacharias in the wildernes. 
\v 3 And hee came into all the coastes about Iordan, preaching the baptisme of repentance for the remission of sinnes, 
\v 4 As it is written in the booke of the sayings of Esaias the Prophet, which saith, The voyce of him that crieth in the wildernes is, Prepare ye the way of the Lord: make his paths straight. 
\v 5 Euery valley shalbe filled, and euery mountaine and hill shall be brought lowe, and crooked things shalbe made straight, and the rough wayes shalbe made smoothe. 
\v 6 And all flesh shall see the saluation of God. 
\v 7 Then said he to the people that were come out to be baptized of him, O generations of vipers, who hath forewarned you to flee from the wrath to come? 
\v 8 Bring foorth therefore fruites worthy amendment of life, and beginne not to say with your selues, We haue Abraham to our father: for I say vnto you, that God is able of these stones to raise vp children vnto Abraham. 
\v 9 Nowe also is the axe layed vnto the roote of the trees: therefore euery tree which bringeth not foorth good fruite, shalbe hewen downe, and cast into the fire. 
\v 10 Then the people asked him, saying, What shall we doe then? 
\v 11 And he answered, and said vnto them, He that hath two coates, let him part with him that hath none: and hee that hath meate, let him doe likewise. 
\v 12 Then came there Publicanes also to bee baptized, and saide vnto him, Master, what shall we doe? 
\v 13 And hee saide vnto them, Require no more then that which is appointed vnto you. 
\v 14 The souldiers likewise demaunded of him, saying, And what shall we doe? And he saide vnto them, Doe violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely, and be content with your wages. 
\v 15 As the people waited, and all men mused in their heartes of Iohn, if he were not that Christ, 
\v 16 Iohn answered, and saide to them all, In deede I baptize you with water, but one stronger then I, commeth, whose shoes latchet I am not worthy to vnloose: hee will baptize you with the holy Ghost, and with fire. 
\v 17 Whose fanne is in his hande, and hee will make cleane his floore, and will gather the wheate into his garner, but the chaffe will hee burne vp with fire that neuer shalbe quenched. 
\v 18 Thus then exhorting with many other things, he preached vnto the people. 
\v 19 But when Herod the Tetrarch was rebuked of him, for Herodias his brother Philips wife, and for all the euils which Herod had done, 
\v 20 He added yet this aboue all, that he shut vp Iohn in prison. 
\v 21 Nowe it came to passe, as all the people were baptized, and that Iesus was baptized and did pray, that the heauen was opened: 
\v 22 And the holy Ghost came downe in a bodily shape like a doue, vpon him, and there was a voyce from heauen, saying, Thou art my beloued Sonne: in thee I am well pleased. 
\v 23 And Iesus himselfe began to bee about thirtie yeere of age, being as men supposed the sonne of Ioseph, which was the sonne of Eli, 
\v 24 The sonne of Matthat, the sonne of Leui, the sonne of Melchi, the sonne of Ianna, the sonne of Ioseph, 
\v 25 The sonne of Mattathias, the sonne of Amos, the sonne of Naum, the sonne of Esli, the sonne of Nagge, 
\v 26 The sonne of Maath, the sonne of Mattathias, the sonne of Semei, the sonne of Ioseph, the sonne of Iuda, 
\v 27 The sonne of Ioanna, the sonne of Rhesa, the sonne of Zorobabel, the sonne of Salathiel, the sonne of Neri, 
\v 28 The sonne of Melchi, the sonne of Addi, the sonne of Cosam, the sonne of Elmodam, the sonne of Er, 
\v 29 The sonne of Iose, the sonne of Eliezer, the sonne of Iorim, the sonne of Matthat, the son of Leui, 
\v 30 The sonne of Simeon, the sonne of Iuda, the sonne of Ioseph, the sonne of Ionan, the sonne of Eliacim, 
\v 31 The sonne of Melea, the sonne of Mainan, the sonne of Mattatha, the sonne of Nathan, the sonne of Dauid, 
\v 32 The sonne of Iesse, the sonne of Obed, the sonne of Booz, the sonne of Salmon, the sonne of Naasson, 
\v 33 The sonne of Aminadab, the sonne of Aram, the sonne of Esrom, the sonne of Phares, the sonne of Iuda, 
\v 34 The sonne of Iacob, the sonne of Isaac, the sonne of Abraham, the sonne of Thara, the sonne of Nachor, 
\v 35 The sonne of Saruch, the sonne of Ragau, the sonne of Phalec, the sonne of Eber, the sonne of Sala, 
\v 36 The sonne of Cainan, the sonne of Arphaxad, the sonne of Sem, the sonne of Noe, the sonne of Lamech, 
\v 37 The sonne of Mathusala, the sonne of Enoch, the sonne of Iared, the sonne of Maleleel, the sonne of Cainan, 
\v 38 The sonne of Enos, the sonne of Seth, the sonne of Adam, the sonne of God. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 And Iesus full of the holy Ghost returned from Iordan, and was led by that Spirit into the wildernes, 
\v 2 And was there fourtie dayes tempted of the deuil, and in those dayes he did eate nothing: but when they were ended, he afterward was hungry. 
\v 3 Then the deuil saide vnto him, If thou be the Sonne of God, commaund this stone that it be made bread. 
\v 4 But Iesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall not liue by bread only, but by euery word of God. 
\v 5 Then the deuill tooke him vp into an high mountaine, and shewed him all the kingdomes of the world, in the twinkeling of an eye. 
\v 6 And the deuill saide vnto him, All this power will I giue thee, and the glory of those kingdomes: for that is deliuered to mee: and to whomsoeuer I will, I giue it. 
\v 7 If thou therefore wilt worship mee, they shalbe all thine. 
\v 8 But Iesus answered him, and saide, Hence from mee, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him alone thou shalt serue. 
\v 9 Then hee brought him to Hierusalem, and set him on a pinacle of the Temple, and said vnto him, If thou be the Sonne of God, cast thy selfe downe from hence, 
\v 10 For it is written, That hee will giue his Angels charge ouer thee to keepe thee: 
\v 11 And with their handes they shall lift thee vp, least at any time thou shouldest dash thy foote against a stone. 
\v 12 And Iesus answered, and said vnto him, It is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. 
\v 13 And when the deuil had ended all the tentation, he departed from him for a litle season. 
\v 14 And Iesus returned by the power of the spirite into Galile: and there went a fame of him throughout all the region round about. 
\v 15 For he taught in their Synagogues, and was honoured of all men. 
\v 16 And hee came to Nazareth where hee had bene brought vp, and (as his custome was) went into the Synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stoode vp to reade. 
\v 17 And there was deliuered vnto him the booke of the Prophet Esaias: and when hee had opened the booke, hee founde the place, where it was written, 
\v 18 The Spirit of the Lord is vpon mee, because he hath anoynted me, that I should preach the Gospel to the poore: he hath sent mee, that I should heale the broken hearted, that I should preach deliuerance to the captiues, and recouering of sight to the blinde, that I should set at libertie them that are bruised: 
\v 19 And that I should preache the acceptable yeere of the Lord. 
\v 20 And hee closed the booke, and gaue it againe to the minister, and sate downe: and the eyes of all that were in the Synagogue were fastened on him. 
\v 21 Then he began to say vnto them, This day is the Scripture fulfilled in your eares. 
\v 22 And all bare him witnes, and wondered at the gracious wordes, which proceeded out of his mouth, and said, Is not this Iosephs sonne? 
\v 23 Then he said vnto them, Ye will surely say vnto mee this prouerbe, Physician, heale thy selfe: whatsoeuer we haue heard done in Capernaum, doe it here likewise in thine owne countrey. 
\v 24 And he saide, Verely I say vnto you, No Prophet is accepted in his owne countrey. 
\v 25 But I tell you of a trueth, many widowes were in Israel in the dayes of Elias, when heauen was shut three yeres and sixe moneths, when great famine was throughout all the land: 
\v 26 But vnto none of them was Elias sent, saue into Sarepta, a citie of Sidon, vnto a certaine widowe. 
\v 27 Also many lepers were in Israel, in the time of Eliseus the Prophet: yet none of them was made cleane, sauing Naaman the Syrian. 
\v 28 Then all that were in the Synagogue, when they heard it, were filled with wrath, 
\v 29 And rose vp, and thrust him out of the citie, and led him vnto the edge of the hil, whereon their citie was built, to cast him downe headlong. 
\v 30 But he passed through the middes of them, and went his way, 
\v 31 And came downe into Capernaum a citie of Galile, and there taught them on the Sabbath dayes. 
\v 32 And they were astonied at his doctrine: for his worde was with authoritie. 
\v 33 And in the Synagogue there was a man which had a spirit of an vncleane deuill, which cryed with a loude voyce, 
\v 34 Saying, Oh, what haue we to doe with thee, thou Iesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy vs? I know who thou art, euen the holy one of God. 
\v 35 And Iesus rebuked him, saying, Holde thy peace, and come out of him. Then the deuill throwing him in the middes of them, came out of him, and hurt him nothing at all. 
\v 36 So feare came on them all, and they spake among themselues, saying, What thing is this: for with authoritie and power he commaundeth the foule spirits, and they come out? 
\v 37 And ye fame of him spred abroad throughout all the places of the countrey round about. 
\v 38 And he rose vp, and came out of the Synagogue, and entred into Simons house. And Simons wiues mother was taken with a great feuer, and they required him for her. 
\v 39 Then he stoode ouer her, and rebuked the feuer, and it left her, and immediatly she arose, and ministred vnto them. 
\v 40 Now at the sunne setting, all they that had sicke folkes of diuers diseases, brought them vnto him, and he layd his hands on euery one of them, and healed them. 
\v 41 And deuils also came out of many, crying, and saying, Thou art that Christ that Sonne of God: but he rebuked them, and suffered them not to say that they knewe him to be that Christ. 
\v 42 And when it was day, he departed, and went foorth into a desart place, and the people sought him, and came to him, and kept him that he should not depart from them. 
\v 43 But he sayd vnto them, Surely I must also preach the kingdome of God to other cities: for therefore am I sent. 
\v 44 And hee preached in the Synagogues of Galile. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 Then it came to passe, as the people preassed vpon him to heare the word of God, that he stoode by the lake of Gennesaret, 
\v 2 And sawe two shippes stand by the lakes side, but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing their nettes. 
\v 3 And he entred into one of the ships, which was Simons, and required him that he would thrust off a litle from the land: and he sate downe, and taught the people out of the ship. 
\v 4 Now when he had left speaking, he sayd vnto Simon, Lanch out into the deepe, and let downe your nettes to make a draught. 
\v 5 Then Simon answered, and sayd vnto him, Master, we haue trauailed sore all night, and haue taken nothing: neuerthelesse at thy worde I will let downe the net. 
\v 6 And when they had so done, they enclosed a great multitude of fishes, so that their net brake. 
\v 7 And they beckened to their parteners, which were in the other ship, that they shoulde come and helpe them, who came then, and filled both the ships, that they did sinke. 
\v 8 Now when Simon Peter saw it, he fel down at Iesus knees, saying, Lord, go from me: for I am a sinfull man. 
\v 9 For he was vtterly astonied, and all that were with him, for the draught of fishes which they tooke. 
\v 10 And so was also Iames and Iohn the sonnes of Zebedeus, which were companions with Simon. Then Iesus sayde vnto Simon, Feare not: from henceforth thou shalt catch men. 
\v 11 And when they had brought the ships to land, they forsooke all, and followed him. 
\v 12 Nowe it came to passe, as he was in a certaine citie, beholde, there was a man full of leprosie, and when he sawe Iesus, he fell on his face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me cleane. 
\v 13 So he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will, be thou cleane. And immediately the leprosie departed from him. 
\v 14 And he commanded him that hee should tell it no man: but Go, sayth he, and shew thy selfe to the Priest, and offer for thy clensing, as Moses hath commanded, for a witnes vnto them. 
\v 15 But so much more went there a fame abroad of him, and great multitudes came together to heare, and to be healed of him of their infirmities. 
\v 16 But he kept himselfe apart in the wildernes, and prayed. 
\v 17 And it came to passe, on a certaine day, as he was teaching, that the Pharises and doctours of the Law sate by, which were come out of euery towne of Galile, and Iudea, and Hierusalem, and the power of the Lord was in him to heale them. 
\v 18 Then beholde, men brought a man lying in a bed, which was taken with a palsie, and they sought meanes to bring him in, and to lay him before him. 
\v 19 And when they could not finde by what way they might bring him in, because of the preasse, they went vp on the house, and let him downe through the tyling, bed and all, in the middes before Iesus. 
\v 20 And when he sawe their faith, he sayd vnto him, Man, thy sinnes are forgiuen thee. 
\v 21 Then the Scribes and the Pharises began to reason, saying, Who is this that speaketh blasphemies? who can forgiue sinnes, but God onely? 
\v 22 But when Iesus perceiued their reasoning, he answered, and sayd vnto them, What reason ye in your hearts? 
\v 23 Whether is easier to say, Thy sinnes are forgiuen thee, or to say, Rise and walke? 
\v 24 But that ye may know that that Sonne of man hath authoritie to forgiue sinnes in earth, (he sayd vnto the sicke of the palsie) I say to thee, Arise: take vp thy bed, and goe to thine house. 
\v 25 And immediatly he rose vp before them, and tooke vp his bed whereon he lay, and departed to his owne house, praysing God. 
\v 26 And they were all amased, and praysed God, and were filled with feare, saying, Doutlesse we haue seene strange things to day. 
\v 27 And after that, he went foorth and sawe a Publicane named Leui, sitting at the receite of custome, and sayd vnto him, Follow me. 
\v 28 And he left all, rose vp, and folowed him. 
\v 29 Then Leui made him a great feast in his owne house, where there was a great company of Publicanes, and of other that sate at table with them. 
\v 30 But they that were Scribes and Pharises among them, murmured against his disciples, saying, Why eate ye and drinke ye with Publicanes and sinners? 
\v 31 Then Iesus answered, and sayd vnto them, They that are whole, neede not the Physician, but they that are sicke. 
\v 32 I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. 
\v 33 Then they said vnto him, Why do the disciples of Iohn fast often, and pray, and the disciples of the Pharises also, but thine eate and drinke? 
\v 34 And he said vnto them, Can ye make the children of the wedding chamber to fast, as long as the bridegrome is with them? 
\v 35 But the dayes will come, euen when the bridegrome shalbe taken away from them: then shall they fast in those dayes. 
\v 36 Againe he spake also vnto them a parable, No man putteth a piece of a newe garment into an olde vesture: for then the newe renteth it, and the piece taken out of the newe, agreeth not with the olde. 
\v 37 Also no man powreth newe wine into olde vessels: for then ye new wine wil breake the vessels, and it will runne out, and the vessels will perish: 
\v 38 But newe wine must be powred into newe vessels: so both are preserued. 
\v 39 Also no man that drinketh olde wine, straightway desireth newe: for he sayth, The olde is more profitable. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1 And it came to passe on a second solemne Sabbath, that hee went through the corne fieldes, and his disciples plucked the eares of corne, and did eate, and rub them in their hands. 
\v 2 And certaine of the Pharises sayde vnto them, Why doe ye that which is not lawfull to doe on the Sabbath dayes? 
\v 3 Then Iesus answered them, and said, Haue ye not read this, that Dauid did when he himselfe was an hungred, and they which were with him, 
\v 4 Howe he went into the house of God, and tooke, and ate the shewbread, and gaue also to them which were with him, which was not lawful to eate, but for the Priests onely? 
\v 5 And he sayd vnto them, The Sonne of man is Lord also of the Sabbath day. 
\v 6 It came to passe also on another Sabbath, that hee entred into the Synagogue, and taught, and there was a man, whose right hand was dryed vp. 
\v 7 And the Scribes and Pharises watched him, whether he would heale on the Sabbath day, that they might finde an accusation against him. 
\v 8 But he knew their thoughts, and sayd to the man which had the withered hand, Arise, and stand vp in the middes. And hee arose, and stoode vp. 
\v 9 Then sayd Iesus vnto them, I will aske you a question, Whether is it lawfull on the Sabbath dayes to doe good, or to doe euill? to saue life, or to destroy? 
\v 10 And he behelde them all in compasse, and sayd vnto the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he did so, and his hand was restored againe, as whole as the other. 
\v 11 Then they were filled full of madnes, and communed one with another, what they might doe to Iesus. 
\v 12 And it came to passe in those dayes, that he went into a mountaine to praye, and spent the night in prayer to God. 
\v 13 And when it was day, he called his disciples, and of them he chose twelue which also he called Apostles. 
\v 14 (Simon whome he named also Peter, and Andrew his brother, Iames and Iohn, Philippe and Bartlemewe: 
\v 15 Matthewe and Thomas: Iames the sonne of Alpheus, and Simon called Zelous, 
\v 16 Iudas Iames brother, and Iudas Iscariot, which also was the traitour.) 
\v 17 Then he came downe with them, and stood in a plaine place, with the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Iudea, and Hierusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyrus and Sidon, which came to heare him, and to be healed of their diseases: 
\v 18 And they that were vexed with foule spirits, and they were healed. 
\v 19 And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went vertue out of him, and healed them all. 
\v 20 And hee lifted vp his eyes vpon his disciples, and sayd, Blessed be ye poore: for yours is the kingdome of God. 
\v 21 Blessed are ye that hunger nowe: for ye shalbe satisfied: blessed are ye that weepe now: for ye shall laugh. 
\v 22 Blessed are ye when men hate you, and when they separate you, and reuile you, and put out your name as euill, for the Sonne of mans sake. 
\v 23 Reioyce ye in that day, and be glad: for beholde, your reward is great in heauen: for after this maner their fathers did to the Prophets. 
\v 24 But wo be to you that are rich: for ye haue receiued your consolation. 
\v 25 Wo be to you that are full: for ye shall hunger. Wo be to you that now laugh: for ye shall wayle and weepe. 
\v 26 Wo be to you when all men speake well of you: for so did their fathers to the false prophets. 
\v 27 But I say vnto you which heare, Loue your enemies: doe well to them which hate you. 
\v 28 Blesse them that curse you, and pray for them which hurt you. 
\v 29 And vnto him that smiteth thee on ye one cheeke, offer also the other: and him that taketh away thy cloke, forbid not to take thy coate also. 
\v 30 Giue to euery man that asketh of thee: and of him that taketh away the things that be thine, aske them not againe. 
\v 31 And as ye would that men should doe to you, so doe ye to them likewise. 
\v 32 For if yee loue them which loue you, what thanke shall ye haue? for euen the sinners loue those that loue them. 
\v 33 And if ye do good for them which do good for you, what thanke shall ye haue? for euen the sinners doe the same. 
\v 34 And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receiue, what thanke shall yee haue? for euen the sinners lend to sinners, to receiue the like. 
\v 35 Wherefore loue ye your enemies, and doe good, and lend, looking for nothing againe, and your rewarde shalbe great, and ye shalbe the children of the most High: for he is kinde vnto the vnkinde, and to the euill. 
\v 36 Be ye therefore mercifull, as your Father also is mercifull. 
\v 37 Iudge not, and ye shall not be iudged: condemne not, and ye shall not bee condemned: forgiue, and ye shalbe forgiuen. 
\v 38 Giue, and it shalbe giuen vnto you: a good measure, pressed downe, shaken together and running ouer shall men giue into your bosome: for with what measure ye mete, with the same shall men mete to you againe. 
\v 39 And he spake a parable vnto them, Can the blinde leade the blinde? shall they not both fall into the ditche? 
\v 40 The disciple is not aboue his master: but whosoeuer will be a perfect disciple, shall bee as his master. 
\v 41 And why seest thou a mote in thy brothers eye, and considerest not the beame that is in thine owne eye? 
\v 42 Either howe canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou seest not the beame that is in thine owne eye? Hypocrite, cast out the beame out of thine owne eye first, and then shalt thou see, perfectly to pull out the mote that is in thy brothers eye. 
\v 43 For it is not a good tree that bringeth foorth euill fruite: neither an euill tree, that bringeth foorth good fruite. 
\v 44 For euery tree is knowen by his owne fruite: for neither of thornes gather men figges, nor of bushes gather they grapes. 
\v 45 A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth foorth good, and an euill man out of the euill treasure of his heart bringeth foorth euill: for of the aboundance of the heart his mouth speaketh. 
\v 46 But why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things that I speake? 
\v 47 Whosoeuer commeth to mee, and heareth my wordes, and doeth the same, I will shewe you to whome he is like: 
\v 48 He is like a man which built an house, and digged deepe, and layde the fundation on a rocke: and when the waters arose, the flood beat vpon that house, and coulde not shake it: for it was grounded vpon a rocke. 
\v 49 But hee that heareth and doeth not, is like a man that built an house vpon the earth without foundation, against which the flood did beate, and it fell by and by: and the fall of that house was great. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1 When hee had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entred into Capernaum. 
\v 2 And a certaine Ceturions seruant was sicke and readie to die, which was deare vnto him. 
\v 3 And when he heard of Iesus, hee sent vnto him the Elders of the Iewes, beseeching him that he would come, and heale his seruant. 
\v 4 So they came to Iesus, and besought him instantly, saying that hee was worthy that hee should doe this for him: 
\v 5 For he loueth, said they, our nation, and he hath built vs a Synagogue. 
\v 6 Then Iesus went with them: but when he was now not farre from the house, the Centurion sent friendes to him, saying vnto him, Lord, trouble not thy selfe: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter vnder my roofe: 
\v 7 Wherefore I thought not my selfe worthy to come vnto thee: but say the word, and my seruant shalbe whole: 
\v 8 For I likewise am a man set vnder authoritie, and haue vnder mee souldiers, and I say vnto one, Goe, and he goeth: and to another, Come, and hee commeth: and to my seruant, Doe this, and he doeth it. 
\v 9 When Iesus heard these things, he marueiled at him, and turned him, and said to the people, that followed him, I say vnto you, I haue not found so great faith, no not in Israel. 
\v 10 And when they that were sent, turned backe to the house, they founde the seruant that was sicke, whole. 
\v 11 And it came to passe the day after, that he went into a citie called Nain, and many of his disciples went with him, and a great multitude. 
\v 12 Nowe when hee came neere to the gate of the citie, behold, there was a dead man caried out, who was the onely begotten sonne of his mother, which was a widowe, and much people of the citie was with her. 
\v 13 And when the Lord sawe her, he had compassion on her, and said vnto her, Weepe not. 
\v 14 And he went and touched the coffin (and they that bare him, stoode still) and he said, Yong man, I say vnto thee, Arise. 
\v 15 And he that was dead, sate vp, and began to speake, and he deliuered him to his mother. 
\v 16 Then there came a feare on them all, and they glorified God, saying, A great Prophet is risen among vs, and God hath visited his people. 
\v 17 And this rumour of him went foorth throughout all Iudea, and throughout all the region round about. 
\v 18 And the disciples of Iohn shewed him of all these things. 
\v 19 So Iohn called vnto him two certaine men of his disciples, and sent them to Iesus, saying, Art thou hee that should come, or shall we waite for another? 
\v 20 And when the men were come vnto him, they said, Iohn Baptist hath sent vs vnto thee, saying, Art thou hee that should come, or shall we waite for another? 
\v 21 And at that time, he cured many of their sickenesses, and plagues, and of euill spirites, and vnto many blinde men he gaue sight freely. 
\v 22 And Iesus answered, and saide vnto them, Goe your wayes and shewe Iohn, what things ye haue seene and heard: that the blinde see, the halt goe, the lepers are cleansed, the deafe heare, the dead are raised, and the poore receiue the Gospel. 
\v 23 And blessed is hee, that shall not be offended in me. 
\v 24 And when the messengers of Iohn were departed, hee began to speake vnto the people, of Iohn, What went ye out into the wildernes to see? A reede shaken with the winde? 
\v 25 But what went ye out to see? A man clothed in soft rayment? beholde, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and liue delicately, are in Kings courtes. 
\v 26 But what went ye foorth to see? A Prophet? yea, I say to you, and greater then a Prophet. 
\v 27 This is he of whom it is written, Beholde, I sende my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. 
\v 28 For I say vnto you, there is no greater Prophet then Iohn, among them that are begotten of women: neuerthelesse, hee that is the least in the kingdome of God, is greater then he. 
\v 29 Then all the people that heard, and the Publicanes iustified God, being baptized with the baptisme of Iohn. 
\v 30 But the Pharises and the expounders of the Law despised the counsell of God against themselues, and were not baptized of him. 
\v 31 And the Lord saide, Whereunto shall I liken the men of this generation? and what thing are they like vnto? 
\v 32 They are like vnto litle children sitting in the market place, and crying one to another, and saying, We haue piped vnto you, and ye haue not daunced: we haue mourned to you, and ye haue not wept. 
\v 33 For Iohn Baptist came, neither eating bread, nor drinking wine: and ye say, He hath the deuil. 
\v 34 The Sonne of man is come, and eateth and drinketh: and ye say, Beholde, a man which is a glutton, and a drinker of wine, a friend of Publicanes and sinners: 
\v 35 But wisdome is iustified of all her children. 
\v 36 And one of the Pharises desired him that hee would eate with him: and hee went into the Pharises house, and sate downe at table. 
\v 37 And beholde, a woman in the citie, which was a sinner, when she knewe that Iesus sate at table in the Pharises house, shee brought a boxe of oyntment. 
\v 38 And shee stoode at his feete behinde him weeping, and began to wash his feete with teares, and did wipe them with the heares of her head, and kissed his feete, and anoynted them with the oyntment. 
\v 39 Nowe when the Pharise which bade him, saw it, he spake within himselfe, saying, If this man were a Prophet, hee woulde surely haue knowen who, and what maner of woman this is which toucheth him: for she is a sinner. 
\v 40 And Iesus answered, and saide vnto him, Simon, I haue somewhat to say vnto thee. And he said, Master, say on. 
\v 41 There was a certaine lender which had two detters: the one ought fiue hundreth pence, and the other fiftie: 
\v 42 When they had nothing to pay, he forgaue them both: Which of them therefore, tell mee, will loue him most? 
\v 43 Simon answered, and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgaue most. And he said vnto him, Thou hast truely iudged. 
\v 44 Then he turned to the woman, and said vnto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entred into thine house, and thou gauest mee no water to my feete: but she hath washed my feete with teares, and wiped them with the heares of her head. 
\v 45 Thou gauest me no kisse: but she, since the time I came in, hath not ceased to kisse my feete. 
\v 46 Mine head with oyle thou didest not anoint: but she hath anoynted my feete with oyntment. 
\v 47 Wherefore I say vnto thee, many sinnes are forgiuen her: for she loued much. To whom a litle is forgiuen, he doeth loue a litle. 
\v 48 And he saide vnto her, Thy sinnes are forgiuen thee. 
\v 49 And they that sate at table with him, began to say within themselues, Who is this that euen forgiueth sinnes? 
\v 50 And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saued thee: goe in peace. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1 And it came to passe afterwarde, that hee himselfe went through euery citie and towne, preaching and publishing the kingdome of God, and the twelue were with him, 
\v 2 And certaine women, which were healed of euill spirites, and infirmities, as Mary which was called Magdalene, out of whom went seuen deuils, 
\v 3 And Ioanna the wife of Chuza Herods steward, and Susanna, and many other which ministred vnto him of their substance. 
\v 4 Nowe when much people were gathered together, and were come vnto him out of all cities, he spake by a parable. 
\v 5 A sower went out to sowe his seede, and as he sowed, some fell by the wayes side, and it was troden vnder feete, and the foules of heauen deuoured it vp. 
\v 6 And some fell on the stones, and when it was sprong vp, it withered away, because it lacked moystnesse. 
\v 7 And some fell among thornes, and the thornes sprang vp with it, and choked it. 
\v 8 And some fell on good ground, and sprang vp, and bare fruite, an hundreth folde. And as hee sayd these things, he cryed, He that hath eares to heare, let him heare. 
\v 9 Then his disciples asked him, demaunding what parable that was. 
\v 10 And he sayd, Vnto you it is giuen to know the secrets of ye kingdome of God, but to other in parables, that when they see, they shoulde not see, and when they heare, they should not vnderstand. 
\v 11 The parable is this, The seede is the worde of God. 
\v 12 And they that are beside the way, are they that heare: afterward commeth the deuill, and taketh away the worde out of their hearts, least they should beleeue, and be saued. 
\v 13 But they that are on the stones, are they which when they haue heard, receiue ye word with ioy: but they haue no rootes: which for a while beleeue, but in the time of tentation goe away. 
\v 14 And that which fell among thornes, are they which haue heard, and after their departure are choked with cares and with riches, and voluptuous liuing, and bring forth no fruite. 
\v 15 But that which fell in good ground, are they which with an honest and good heart heare the worde, and keepe it, and bring forth fruite with patience. 
\v 16 No man when he hath lighted a candle, couereth it vnder a vessell, neither putteth it vnder the bed, but setteth it on a candlesticke, that they that enter in, may see the light. 
\v 17 For nothing is secret, that shall not be euident: neither any thing hid, that shall not be knowen, and come to light. 
\v 18 Take heede therefore how ye heare: for whosoeuer hath, to him shall be giuen: and whosoeuer hath not, from him shalbe taken euen that which it seemeth that he hath. 
\v 19 Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not come neere to him for the preasse. 
\v 20 And it was tolde him by certaine which said, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, and would see thee. 
\v 21 But he answered, and sayd vnto them, My mother and my brethren are these which heare the worde of God, and doe it. 
\v 22 And it came to passe on a certaine day, that he went into a ship with his disciples, and he sayd vnto them, Let vs goe ouer vnto the other side of the lake. And they lanched forth. 
\v 23 And as they sayled, he fell a sleepe, and there came downe a storme of winde on the lake, and they were filled with water, and were in ieopardie. 
\v 24 Then they went to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, Master, we perish. And he arose, and rebuked the winde, and the waues of water: and they ceased, and it was calme. 
\v 25 Then he sayde vnto them, Where is your fayth? and they feared, and wondered among them selues, saying, Who is this that commandeth both the windes and water, and they obey him! 
\v 26 So they sailed vnto the region of the Gadarenes, which is ouer against Galile. 
\v 27 And as he went out to land, there met him a certaine man out of the citie, which had deuils long time, and he ware no garment, neither abode in house, but in the graues. 
\v 28 And when he sawe Iesus, he cryed out and fell downe before him, and with a loude voyce sayd, What haue I to doe with thee, Iesus the Sonne of God the most High? I beseech thee torment me not. 
\v 29 For he commanded ye foule spirit to come out of the man: (for oft times he had caught him: therefore he was bound with chaines, and kept in fetters: but he brake the bands, and was caried of the deuill into wildernesses.) 
\v 30 Then Iesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? and he sayd, Legion, because many deuils were entred into him. 
\v 31 And they besought him, that he would not commaund them to goe out into the deepe. 
\v 32 And there was there by, an hearde of many swine, feeding on an hill: and the deuils besought him, that he would suffer them to enter into them. So he suffered them. 
\v 33 Then went the deuils out of the man, and entred into the swine: and the hearde was caried with violence from a steepe downe place into the lake, and was choked. 
\v 34 When the heardmen sawe what was done, they fled: and when they were departed, they tolde it in the citie and in the countrey. 
\v 35 Then they came out to see what was done, and came to Iesus, and found the man, out of whom the deuils were departed, sitting at the feete of Iesus, clothed, and in his right minde: and they were afrayd. 
\v 36 They also which saw it, tolde them by what meanes he that was possessed with the deuill, was healed. 
\v 37 Then the whole multitude of the countrey about the Gadarenes, besought him that he would depart from them: for they were taken with a great feare: and he went into the ship, and returned. 
\v 38 Then the man, out of whome the deuils were departed, besought him that hee might be with him: but Iesus sent him away, saying, 
\v 39 Returne into thine owne house, and shewe what great things God hath done to thee. So hee went his way, and preached throughout all the citie, what great things Iesus had done vnto him. 
\v 40 And it came to passe, when Iesus was come againe, that the people receiued him: for they all waited for him. 
\v 41 And beholde, there came a man named Iairus, and he was the ruler of the Synagogue, who fell downe at Iesus feete, and besought him that he would come into his house. 
\v 42 For he had but a daughter onely, about twelue yeeres of age, and she lay a dying (and as he went, the people thronged him. 
\v 43 And a woman hauing an yssue of blood, twelue yeeres long, which had spent all her substance vpon physicians, and could not be healed of any: 
\v 44 When she came behind him, she touched the hemme of his garment, and immediatly her yssue of blood stanched. 
\v 45 Then Iesus sayd, Who is it that hath touched me? When euery man denied, Peter sayd and they that were with him, Master, the multitude thrust thee, and tread on thee, and sayest thou, Who hath touched me? 
\v 46 And Iesus sayde, Some one hath touched me: for I perceiue that vertue is gone out of me. 
\v 47 When the woman sawe that she was not hid, she came trembling, and fell downe before him, and tolde him before all the people, for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediatly. 
\v 48 And he said vnto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath saued thee: go in peace.) 
\v 49 While he yet spake, there came one from the ruler of the Synagogues house, which sayde to him, Thy daughter is dead: disease not the Master. 
\v 50 When Iesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Feare not: beleeue onely, and she shall be saued. 
\v 51 And when he went into the house, he suffered no man to goe in with him, saue Peter, and Iames, and Iohn, and the father and mother of the maide. 
\v 52 And all wept, and sorowed for her: but he sayd, Weepe not: for she is not dead, but sleepeth. 
\v 53 And they laught him to scorne, knowing that she was dead. 
\v 54 So he thrust them all out, and tooke her by the hand, and cryed, saying, Maide, arise. 
\v 55 And her spirite came againe, and she rose straightway: and he comanded to giue her meate. 
\v 56 Then her parents were astonied: but hee commanded them that they should tell no man what was done. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 Then called hee his twelue disciples together, and gaue them power and authoritie ouer all deuils, and to heale diseases. 
\v 2 And hee sent them foorth to preach the kingdome of God, and to cure the sicke. 
\v 3 And he sayd to them, Take nothing to your iourney, neither staues, nor scrip, neither bread, nor siluer, neither haue two coates apiece. 
\v 4 And whatsoeuer house ye enter into, there abide, and thence depart. 
\v 5 And howe many so euer will not receiue you, when ye goe out of that citie, shake off the very dust from your feete for a testimonie against them. 
\v 6 And they went out, and went through euery towne preaching the Gospel, and healing euery where. 
\v 7 Nowe Herod the Tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he douted, because that it was sayd of some, that Iohn was risen againe from the dead: 
\v 8 And of some, that Elias had appeared: and of some, that one of the olde Prophets was risen againe. 
\v 9 Then Herod sayd, Iohn haue I beheaded: who then is this of whome I heare such things? and he desired to see him. 
\v 10 And when the Apostles returned, they tolde him what great things they had done. Then he tooke them to him, and went aside into a solitarie place, neere to the citie called Bethsaida. 
\v 11 But when the people knewe it, they followed him: and he receiued them, and spake vnto them of the kingdome of God, and healed them that had neede to be healed. 
\v 12 And when the day began to weare away, the twelue came, and sayd vnto him, Sende the people away, that they may goe into the townes and villages round about, and lodge, and get meate: for we are here in a desart place. 
\v 13 But he sayd vnto them, Giue ye them to eate. And they sayd, We haue no more but fiue loaues and two fishes, except we should go and buy meate for all this people. 
\v 14 For they were about fiue thousand men. Then he sayde to his disciples, Cause them to sit downe by fifties in a company. 
\v 15 And they did so, and caused all to sit downe. 
\v 16 Then he tooke the fiue loaues, and the two fishes, and looked vp to heauen, and blessed them, and brake, and gaue to the disciples, to set before the people. 
\v 17 So they did all eate, and were satisfied: and there was taken vp of that remained to them, twelue baskets full of broken meate. 
\v 18 And it came to passe, as hee was alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am? 
\v 19 They answered, and sayd, Iohn Baptist: and others say, Elias: and some say, that one of the olde Prophets is risen againe. 
\v 20 And he sayd vnto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answered, and sayd, That Christ of God. 
\v 21 And he warned and commanded them, that they should tell that to no man, 
\v 22 Saying, The Sonne of man must suffer many things and be reproued of the Elders, and of the hie Priests and Scribes, and be slaine, and the third day rise againe. 
\v 23 And he sayd to them all, If any man will come after me, let him denie himselfe, and take vp his crosse dayly, and follow me. 
\v 24 For whosoeuer will saue his life, shall lose it: and whosoeuer shall lose his life for my sake, the same shall saue it. 
\v 25 For what auantageth it a man, if he win the whole worlde, and destroy himselfe, or lose himselfe? 
\v 26 For whosoeuer shall be ashamed of me, and of my wordes, of him shall the Sonne of man be ashamed, when hee shall come in his glorie, and in the glorie of the Father, and of the holy Angels. 
\v 27 And I tell you of a suretie, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they haue seene the kingdome of God. 
\v 28 And it came to passe about an eyght dayes after those wordes, that he tooke Peter and Iohn, and Iames, and went vp into a mountaine to pray. 
\v 29 And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was changed, and his garment was white and glistered. 
\v 30 And beholde, two men talked with him, which were Moses and Elias: 
\v 31 Which appeared in glory, and tolde of his departing, which he shoulde accomplish at Hierusalem. 
\v 32 But Peter and they that were with him, were heauie with sleepe, and when they awoke, they saw his glorie, and the two men standing with him. 
\v 33 And it came to passe, as they departed from him, Peter said vnto Iesus, Master, it is good for vs to be here: let vs therefore make three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias, and wist not what he said. 
\v 34 Whiles he thus spake, there came a cloude and ouershadowed them, and they feared when they were entring into the cloude. 
\v 35 And there came a voyce out of the cloud, saying, This is that my beloued Sonne, heare him. 
\v 36 And when the voyce was past, Iesus was found alone: and they kept it close, and tolde no man in those dayes any of those things which they had seene. 
\v 37 And it came to passe on the next day, as they came downe from the mountaine, much people met him. 
\v 38 And beholde, a man of the companie cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, beholde my sonne: for he is all that I haue. 
\v 39 And loe, a spirit taketh him, and suddenly he crieth, and he teareth him, that he fometh, and hardly departeth from him, when he hath bruised him. 
\v 40 Nowe I haue besought thy disciples to cast him out, but they could not. 
\v 41 Then Iesus answered, and said, O generation faithlesse, and crooked, howe long now shall I be with you, and suffer you? bring thy sonne hither. 
\v 42 And whiles he was yet comming, the deuill rent him, and tare him: and Iesus rebuked the vncleane spirite, and healed the childe, and deliuered him to his father. 
\v 43 And they were all amased at the mightie power of God: and while they all wondered at al things, which Iesus did, he said vnto his disciples, 
\v 44 Marke these wordes diligently: for it shall come to passe, that the Sonne of man shalbe deliuered into the handes of men. 
\v 45 But they vnderstood not that word: for it was hid from them, so that they could not perceiue it: and they feared to aske him of that worde. 
\v 46 Then there arose a disputation among them, which of them should be the greatest. 
\v 47 When Iesus sawe the thoughtes of their heartes, he tooke a litle childe, and set him by him, 
\v 48 And said vnto them, Whosoeuer receiueth this litle childe in my Name, receiueth me: and whosoeuer shall receiue me, receiueth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, he shall be great. 
\v 49 And Iohn answered and saide, Master, we sawe one casting out deuils in thy Name, and we forbad him, because he followeth thee not with vs. 
\v 50 Then Iesus saide vnto him, Forbid ye him not: for he that is not against vs, is with vs. 
\v 51 And it came to passe, when the dayes were accomplished, that he should be receiued vp, he setled himselfe fully to goe to Hierusalem, 
\v 52 And sent messengers before him: and they went and entred into a towne of the Samaritans, to prepare him lodging. 
\v 53 But they woulde not receiue him, because his behauiour was, as though he would go to Hierusalem. 
\v 54 And when his disciples, Iames and Iohn sawe it, they saide, Lord, wilt thou that we commaund, that fire come downe from heauen, and consume them, euen as Elias did? 
\v 55 But Iesus turned about, and rebuked them, and said, Ye knowe not of what spirit ye are. 
\v 56 For the Sonne of man is not come to destroy mens liues, but to saue them. Then they went to another towne. 
\v 57 And it came to passe that as they went in the way, a certaine man said vnto him, I will follow thee, Lord, whithersoeuer thou goest. 
\v 58 And Iesus saide vnto him, The foxes haue holes, and the birdes of the heauen nestes, but the Sonne of man hath not whereon to lay his head. 
\v 59 But he said vnto another, Followe me. And the same said, Lord, suffer me first to goe and burie my father. 
\v 60 And Iesus said vnto him, Let the dead burie their dead: but go thou, and preache the kingdome of God. 
\v 61 Then another saide, I will follow thee, Lord: but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at mine house. 
\v 62 And Iesus saide vnto him, No man that putteth his hand to the plough, and looketh backe, is apt to the kingdome of God. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1 After these thinges, the Lord appointed other seuentie also, and sent them, two and two before him into euery citie and place, whither he himselfe should come. 
\v 2 And he said vnto them, The haruest is great, but the labourers are fewe: pray therefore the Lord of the haruest to sende foorth labourers into his haruest. 
\v 3 Goe your wayes: beholde, I send you foorth as lambes among wolues. 
\v 4 Beare no bagge, neither scrippe, nor shoes, and salute no man by the way. 
\v 5 And into whatsoeuer house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house. 
\v 6 And if the sonne of peace be there, your peace shall rest vpon him: if not, it shall turne to you againe. 
\v 7 And in that house tary still, eating and drinking such things as by them shall be set before you: for the labourer is worthy of his wages. Goe not from house to house. 
\v 8 But into whatsoeuer citie ye shall enter, if they receiue you, eate such things as are set before you, 
\v 9 And heale the sicke that are there, and say vnto them, The kingdome of God is come neere vnto you. 
\v 10 But into whatsoeuer citie ye shall enter, if they will not receiue you, goe your wayes out into the streetes of the same, and say, 
\v 11 Euen the very dust, which cleaueth on vs of your citie, we wipe off against you: notwithstanding knowe this, that the kingdome of God was come neere vnto you. 
\v 12 For I say to you, that it shall be easier in that day for them of Sodom, then for that citie. 
\v 13 Woe be to thee, Chorazin: woe be to thee, Beth-saida: for if the miracles had bene done in Tyrus and Sidon, which haue bene done in you, they had a great while agone repented, sitting in sackecloth and ashes. 
\v 14 Therefore it shall be easier for Tyrus, and Sidon, at the iudgement, then for you. 
\v 15 And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heauen, shalt be thrust downe to hell. 
\v 16 He that heareth you, heareth me: and he that despiseth you, despiseth me: and he that despiseth me, despiseth him that sent me. 
\v 17 And the seuentie turned againe with ioy, saying, Lord, euen the deuils are subdued to vs through thy Name. 
\v 18 And he said vnto them, I sawe Satan, like lightening, fall downe from heauen. 
\v 19 Beholde, I giue vnto you power to treade on Serpents, and Scorpions, and ouer all the power of the enemie, and nothing shall hurt you. 
\v 20 Neuerthelesse, in this reioyce not, that the spirits are subdued vnto you: but rather reioyce, because your names are written in heauen. 
\v 21 That same houre reioyced Iesus in the spirit, and said, I confesse vnto thee, Father, Lord of heauen and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and vnderstanding, and hast reueiled them to babes: euen so, Father, because it so pleased thee. 
\v 22 All things are giuen me of my Father: and no man knoweth who the Sonne is, but the Father: neither who the Father is, saue the Sonne, and he to whom the Sonne will reueile him. 
\v 23 And he turned to his disciples, and said secretly, Blessed are the eyes, which see that ye see. 
\v 24 For I tell you that many Prophets and Kings haue desired to see those things, which ye see, and haue not seene them: and to heare those things which ye heare, and haue not heard them. 
\v 25 Then beholde, a certaine Lawyer stoode vp, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I doe, to inherite eternall life? 
\v 26 And he saide vnto him, What is written in the Lawe? howe readest thou? 
\v 27 And he answered, and saide, Thou shalt loue thy Lord God with all thine heart, and with all thy soule, and with all thy strength, and with all thy thought, and thy neighbour as thy selfe. 
\v 28 Then he said vnto him, Thou hast answered right: this doe, and thou shalt liue. 
\v 29 But he willing to iustifie himselfe, said vnto Iesus, Who is then my neighbour? 
\v 30 And Iesus answered, and saide, A certaine man went downe from Hierusalem to Iericho, and fell among theeues, and they robbed him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leauing him halfe dead. 
\v 31 Nowe so it fell out, that there came downe a certaine Priest that same way, and when he sawe him, he passed by on the other side. 
\v 32 And likewise also a Leuite, when he was come neere to the place, went and looked on him, and passed by on the other side. 
\v 33 Then a certaine Samaritane, as he iourneyed, came neere vnto him, and when he sawe him, he had compassion on him, 
\v 34 And went to him, and bound vp his wounds, and powred in oyle and wine, and put him on his owne beast, and brought him to an Inne, and made prouision for him. 
\v 35 And on the morowe when he departed, he tooke out two pence, and gaue them to the hoste, and said vnto him, Take care of him, and whatsoeuer thou spendest more, when I come againe, I will recompense thee. 
\v 36 Which nowe of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour vnto him that fell among the theeues? 
\v 37 And he saide, He that shewed mercie on him. Then said Iesus vnto him, Goe, and do thou likewise. 
\v 38 Nowe it came to passe, as they went, that he entred into a certaine towne, and a certaine woman named Martha, receiued him into her house. 
\v 39 And she had a sister called Marie, which also sate at Iesus feete, and heard his preaching. 
\v 40 But Martha was combred about much seruing, and came to him, and saide, Master, doest thou not care that my sister hath left me to serue alone? bid her therefore, that she helpe me. 
\v 41 And Iesus answered, and said vnto her, Martha, Martha, thou carest, and art troubled about many things: 
\v 42 But one thing is needefull, Marie hath chosen the good part, which shall not be taken away from her. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 And so it was, that as he was praying in a certaine place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said vnto him, Lord, teache vs to pray, as Iohn also taught his disciples. 
\v 2 And he said vnto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father, which art in heauen, halowed be thy Name: Thy kingdome come: Let thy will be done, euen in earth, as it is in heauen: 
\v 3 Our dayly bread giue vs for the day: 
\v 4 And forgiue vs our sinnes: for euen we forgiue euery man that is indetted to vs: And leade vs not into temptation: but deliuer vs from euill. 
\v 5 Moreouer he said vnto them, Which of you shall haue a friende, and shall goe to him at midnight, and say vnto him, Friende, lende mee three loaues? 
\v 6 For a friende of mine is come out of the way to me, and I haue nothing to set before him: 
\v 7 And hee within shoulde answere, and say, Trouble mee not: the doore is nowe shut, and my children are with mee in bed: I can not rise and giue them to thee. 
\v 8 I say vnto you, Though he would not arise and giue him, because he is his friende, yet doubtlesse because of his importunitie, hee woulde rise, and giue him as many as he needed. 
\v 9 And I say vnto you, Aske, and it shall be giuen you: seeke, and yee shall finde: knocke, and it shalbe opened vnto you. 
\v 10 For euery one that asketh, receiueth: and he that seeketh, findeth: and to him that knocketh, it shalbe opened. 
\v 11 If a sonne shall aske bread of any of you that is a father, will he giue him a stone? or if hee aske a fish, will he for a fish giue him a serpent? 
\v 12 Or if hee aske an egge, will hee giue him a scorpion? 
\v 13 If yee then which are euill, can giue good giftes vnto your children, howe much more shall your heauenly Father giue the holy Ghost to them, that desire him? 
\v 14 Then hee cast out a deuill which was domme: and when the deuill was gone out, the domme spake, and the people wondered. 
\v 15 But some of them said, He casteth out deuils through Beelzebub the chiefe of ye deuils. 
\v 16 And others tempted him, seeking of him a signe from heauen. 
\v 17 But he knew their thoughts, and said vnto them, Euery kingdom deuided against it self, shall be desolate, and an house deuided against an house, falleth. 
\v 18 So if Satan also bee deuided against himselfe, howe shall his kingdome stande, because yee say that I cast out deuils through Beelzebub? 
\v 19 If I through Beelzebub cast out deuils, by whome doe your children cast them out? Therefore shall they be your iudges. 
\v 20 But if I by ye finger of God cast out deuils, doutles the kingdome of God is come vnto you. 
\v 21 When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, the thinges that hee possesseth, are in peace. 
\v 22 But when a stronger then hee, commeth vpon him, and ouercommeth him: hee taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and deuideth his spoiles. 
\v 23 He that is not with me, is against me: and he that gathereth not with me, scattereth. 
\v 24 When the vncleane spirite is gone out of a man, he walketh through drie places, seeking rest: and when he findeth none he saieth, I wil returne vnto mine house whence I came out. 
\v 25 And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished. 
\v 26 Then goeth hee, and taketh to him seuen other spirites worse then himselfe: and they enter in, and dwel there: so the last state of that man is worse then the first. 
\v 27 And it came to passe as he sayde these thinges, a certaine woman of the companie lifted vp her voyce, and sayde vnto him, Blessed is the wombe that bare thee, and the pappes which thou hast sucked. 
\v 28 But hee saide, Yea, rather blessed are they that heare the woorde of God, and keepe it. 
\v 29 And when the people were gathered thicke together, he began to say, This is a wicked generation: they seeke a signe, and there shall no signe be giuen them, but the signe of Ionas the Prophet. 
\v 30 For as Ionas was a signe to the Niniuites: so shall also the Sonne of man bee to this generation. 
\v 31 The Queene of the South shall rise in iudgement, with the men of this generation, and shall condemne them: for shee came from the vtmost partes of the earth to heare the wisedome of Salomon, and beholde, a greater then Salomon is here. 
\v 32 The men of Niniue shall rise in iudgement with this generation, and shall condemne it: for they repented at the preaching of Ionas: and beholde, a greater then Ionas is here. 
\v 33 No man when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it in a priuie place, neither vnder a bushell: but on a candlesticke, that they which come in, may see the light. 
\v 34 The light of the bodie is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, then is thy whole bodie light: but if thine eye be euill, then thy bodie is darke. 
\v 35 Take heede therefore, that the light which is in thee, be not darkenesse. 
\v 36 If therefore thy whole body shall be light, hauing no part darke, then shall all be light, euen as when a candle doth light thee with the brightnesse. 
\v 37 And as hee spake, a certaine Pharise besought him to dine with him: and hee went in, and sate downe at table. 
\v 38 And when the Pharise saw it, he marueiled that he had not first washed before dinner. 
\v 39 And the Lord saide to him, In deede yee Pharises make cleane the outside of the cuppe, and of the platter: but the inwarde part is full of rauening and wickednesse. 
\v 40 Ye fooles, did not he that made that which is without, make that which is within also? 
\v 41 Therefore, giue almes of those thinges which you haue, and beholde, all thinges shall be cleane to you. 
\v 42 But wo be to you, Pharises: for ye tithe the mynt and the rewe, and all maner herbs, and passe ouer iudgement and the loue of God: these ought yee to haue done, and not to haue left the other vndone. 
\v 43 Wo be to you, Pharises: for ye loue the vppermost seats in the Synagogues, and greetings in the markets. 
\v 44 Wo be to you, Scribes and Pharises, hypocrites: for ye are as graues which appeare not, and the men that walke ouer them, perceiue not. 
\v 45 Then answered one of the Lawyers, and saide vnto him, Master, thus saying thou puttest vs to rebuke also. 
\v 46 And he sayde, Wo be to you also, yee Lawyers: for yee lade men with burdens grieuous to be borne, and yee your selues touche not the burdens with one of your fingers. 
\v 47 Wo be to you: for ye builde the sepulchres of the Prophetes, and your fathers killed them. 
\v 48 Truely ye beare witnesse, and allowe the deedes of your fathers: for they killed them, and yee build their sepulchres. 
\v 49 Therefore said the wisedome of God, I wil sende them Prophets and Apostles, and of them they shall slaie, and persecute away, 
\v 50 That the blood of all the Prophets, shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation, 
\v 51 From the blood of Abel vnto the blood of Zacharias, which was slaine betweene the altar and the Temple: verely I say vnto you, it shall be required of this generation. 
\v 52 Wo be to you, Lawyers: for ye haue taken away the key of knowledge: ye entred not in your selues, and them that came in, ye forbade. 
\v 53 And as he sayde these things vnto them, the Scribes and Pharises began to vrge him sore, and to prouoke him to speake of many things, 
\v 54 Laying wait for him, and seeking to catche some thing of his mouth, whereby they might accuse him. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 In the meane time, there gathered together an innumerable multitude of people, so that they trode one another: and he began to say vnto his disciples first, Take heede to your selues of the leauen of the Pharises, which is hypocrisie. 
\v 2 For there is nothing couered, that shall not bee reueiled: neither hidde, that shall not be knowen. 
\v 3 Wherefore whatsoeuer yee haue spoken in darkenesse, it shall be heard in the light: and that which ye haue spoken in the eare, in secret places, shall be preached on the houses. 
\v 4 And I say vnto you, my friendes, be not afraide of them that kill the bodie, and after that are not able to doe any more. 
\v 5 But I wil forewarne you, who ye shall feare: feare him which after hee hath killed, hath power to cast into hell: yea, I say vnto you, him feare. 
\v 6 Are not fiue sparowes bought for two farthings, and yet not one of them is forgotten before God? 
\v 7 Yea, and all the heares of your head are nombred: feare not therefore: yee are more of value then many sparowes. 
\v 8 Also I say vnto you, Whosoeuer shall confesse mee before men, him shall the Sonne of man confesse also before the Angels of God. 
\v 9 But hee that shall denie mee before men, shall be denied before the Angels of God. 
\v 10 And whosoeuer shall speake a woorde against the Sonne of man, it shall be forgiuen him: but vnto him, that shall blaspheme ye holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiuen. 
\v 11 And when they shall bring you vnto the Synagogues, and vnto the rulers and Princes, take no thought howe, or what thing ye shall answere, or what yee shall speake. 
\v 12 For the holy Ghost shall teache you in the same houre, what yee ought to say. 
\v 13 And one of the companie said vnto him, Master, bidde my brother deuide the inheritance with me. 
\v 14 And he said vnto him, Man, who made me a iudge, or a deuider ouer you? 
\v 15 Wherefore he said vnto them, Take heede, and beware of couetousnesse: for though a man haue abundance, yet his life standeth not in his riches. 
\v 16 And he put foorth a parable vnto them, saying, The grounde of a certaine riche man brought foorth fruites plenteously. 
\v 17 Therefore he thought with himselfe, saying, What shall I doe, because I haue no roume, where I may lay vp my fruites? 
\v 18 And he said, This wil I do, I wil pul downe my barnes, and builde greater, and therein will I gather all my fruites, and my goods. 
\v 19 And I wil say to my soule, Soule, thou hast much goods laide vp for many yeeres: liue at ease, eate, drinke and take thy pastime. 
\v 20 But God said vnto him, O foole, this night wil they fetch away thy soule from thee: then whose shall those things be which thou hast prouided? 
\v 21 So is he that gathereth riches to himselfe, and is not riche in God. 
\v 22 And he spake vnto his disciples, Therefore I say vnto you, Take no thought for your life, what yee shall eate: neither for your body, what yee shall put on. 
\v 23 The life is more then meate: and the body more then the raiment. 
\v 24 Consider the rauens: for they neither sowe nor reape: which neither haue storehouse nor barne, and yet God feedeth them: how much more are yee better then foules? 
\v 25 And which of you with taking thought, can adde to his stature one cubite? 
\v 26 If yee then bee not able to doe the least thing, why take yee thought for the remnant? 
\v 27 Consider the lilies howe they growe: they labour not, neither spin they: yet I say vnto you, that Salomon himselfe in all his royaltie was not clothed like one of these. 
\v 28 If then God so clothe the grasse which is to day in the field, and to morowe is cast into the ouen, howe much more will he clothe you, O yee of litle faith? 
\v 29 Therefore aske not what yee shall eate, or what ye shall drinke, neither hag you in suspense. 
\v 30 For all such things the people of the world seeke for: and your Father knoweth that ye haue neede of these things. 
\v 31 But rather seeke ye after the kingdome of God, and all these things shalbe cast vpon you. 
\v 32 Feare not, litle flocke: for it is your Fathers pleasure, to giue you the kingdome. 
\v 33 Sell that ye haue, and giue almes: make you bagges, which waxe not old, a treasure that can neuer faile in heauen, where no theefe commeth, neither mothe corrupteth. 
\v 34 For where your treasure is, there will your hearts be also. 
\v 35 Let your loynes be gird about and your lights burning, 
\v 36 And ye your selues like vnto men that waite for their master, when he will returne from the wedding, that when he commeth and knocketh, they may open vnto him immediatly. 
\v 37 Blessed are those seruants, whom the Lord when he commeth shall finde waking: verely I say vnto you, he will girde himselfe about, and make them to sit downe at table, and will come forth, and serue them. 
\v 38 And if he come in the seconde watch, or come in the third watch, and shall finde them so, blessed are those seruants. 
\v 39 Nowe vnderstand this, that if the good man of the house had knowen at what houre the theefe would haue come, he would haue watched, and would not haue suffered his house to be digged through. 
\v 40 Be ye also prepared therefore: for the Sonne of man will come at an houre when ye thinke not. 
\v 41 Then Peter saide vnto him, Master, tellest thou this parable vnto vs, or euen to all? 
\v 42 And the Lord saide, Who is a faithfull steward and wise, whom the master shall make ruler ouer his householde, to giue them their portion of meate in season? 
\v 43 Blessed is that seruant, whom his master when he commeth, shall finde so doing. 
\v 44 Of a trueth I say vnto you, that he wil make him ruler ouer all that he hath. 
\v 45 But if that seruant say in his heart, My master doeth deferre his comming, and ginne to smite the seruants, and maydens, and to eate, and drinke, and to be drunken, 
\v 46 The master of that seruant will come in a day when he thinketh not, and at an houre when he is not ware of, and will cut him off, and giue him his portion with the vnbeleeuers. 
\v 47 And that seruant that knewe his masters will, and prepared not himselfe, neither did according to his will, shalbe beaten with many stripes. 
\v 48 But he that knewe it not, and yet did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with fewe stripes: for vnto whomsoeuer much is giuen, of him shalbe much required, and to whom men much commit, the more of him will they aske. 
\v 49 I am come to put fire on the earth, and what is my desire, if it be already kindled? 
\v 50 Notwithstanding I must be baptized with a baptisme, and how am I grieued, till it be ended? 
\v 51 Thinke ye that I am come to giue peace on earth? I tell you, nay, but rather debate. 
\v 52 For from hencefoorth there shall be fiue in one house deuided, three against two, and two against three. 
\v 53 The father shalbe deuided against ye sonne, and the sonne against the father: the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother: the mother in lawe against her daughter in lawe, and the daughter in lawe against her mother in lawe. 
\v 54 Then said he to the people, When ye see a cloude rise out of the West, straightway ye say, A shower commeth: and so it is. 
\v 55 And when ye see the South winde blowe, ye say, that it wilbe hoate: and it commeth to passe. 
\v 56 Hypocrites, ye can discerne the face of the earth, and of the skie: but why discerne ye not this time? 
\v 57 Yea, and why iudge ye not of your selues what is right? 
\v 58 While thou goest with thine aduersarie to the ruler, as thou art in the way, giue diligence in the way, that thou mayest be deliuered from him, least he drawe thee to the iudge, and the iudge deliuer thee to the iayler, and the iayler cast thee into prison. 
\v 59 I tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast payed the vtmost mite. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 There were certaine men present at the same season, that shewed him of the Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. 
\v 2 And Iesus answered, and saide vnto them, Suppose ye, that these Galileans were greater sinners then al the other Galileans, because they haue suffered such things? 
\v 3 I tell you, nay: but except ye amend your liues, ye shall all likewise perish. 
\v 4 Or thinke you that those eighteene, vpon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slewe them, were sinners aboue all men that dwel in Hierusalem? 
\v 5 I tell you, nay: but except ye amend your liues, ye shall all likewise perish. 
\v 6 He spake also this parable, A certaine man had a figge tree planted in his vineyard: and he came and sought fruite thereon, and found none. 
\v 7 Then said he to the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, this three yeeres haue I come and sought fruite of this figge tree, and finde none: cut it downe: why keepeth it also the ground barren? 
\v 8 And he answered, and said vnto him, Lord, let it alone this yeere also, till I digge round about it, and doung it. 
\v 9 And if it beare fruite, well: if not, then after thou shalt cut it downe. 
\v 10 And he taught in one of ye Synagogues on the Sabbath day. 
\v 11 And behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmitie eighteene yeeres, and was bowed together, and coulde not lift vp her selfe in any wise. 
\v 12 When Iesus sawe her, he called her to him, and said to her, Woman, thou art loosed from thy disease. 
\v 13 And he laide his handes on her, and immediately she was made straight againe, and glorified God. 
\v 14 And the ruler of the Synagogue answered with indignation, because that Iesus healed on the Sabbath day, and said vnto the people, There are sixe dayes in which men ought to worke: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day. 
\v 15 Then answered him the Lord, and said, Hypocrite, doth not eche one of you on the Sabbath day loose his oxe or his asse from the stall, and leade him away to the water? 
\v 16 And ought not this daughter of Abraham, whom Satan had bound, loe, eighteene yeeres, be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath day? 
\v 17 And when he said these things, all his aduersaries were ashamed: but all the people reioyced at all the excellent things, that were done by him. 
\v 18 Then said he, What is the kingdome of God like? or whereto shall I compare it? 
\v 19 It is like a graine of mustard seede, which a man tooke and sowed in his garden, and it grewe, and waxed a great tree, and the foules of the heauen made nestes in the branches thereof. 
\v 20 And againe he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdome of God? 
\v 21 It is like leauen, which a woman tooke, and hid in three peckes of floure, till all was leauened. 
\v 22 And he went through all cities and townes, teaching, and iourneying towards Hierusalem. 
\v 23 Then saide one vnto him, Lord, are there fewe that shalbe saued? And he said vnto them, 
\v 24 Striue to enter in at the straite gate: for many, I say vnto you, will seeke to enter in, and shall not be able. 
\v 25 When the good man of the house is risen vp, and hath shut to the doore, and ye begin to stand without, and to knocke at the doore, saying, Lord, Lord, open to vs, and he shall answere and say vnto you, I know you not whence ye are, 
\v 26 Then shall ye begin to say, We haue eaten and drunke in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streetes. 
\v 27 But he shall say, I tell you, I knowe you not whence ye are: depart from me, all ye workers of iniquitie. 
\v 28 There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth when ye shall see Abraham and Isaac, and Iacob, and all the Prophets in the kingdome of God, and your selues thrust out at doores. 
\v 29 Then shall come many from the East, and from the West, and from the North, and from the South, and shall sit at Table in the kingdome of God. 
\v 30 And beholde, there are last, which shalbe first, and there are first, which shalbe last. 
\v 31 The same day there came certaine Pharises, and said vnto him, Depart, and goe hence: for Herod will kill thee. 
\v 32 Then said he vnto them, Goe ye and tell that foxe, Beholde, I cast out deuils, and will heale still to day, and to morowe, and the third day I shalbe perfected. 
\v 33 Neuerthelesse I must walke to day, and to morowe, and the day following: for it cannot be that a Prophet should perish out of Hierusalem. 
\v 34 O Hierusalem, Hierusalem, which killest the Prophets, and stonest them that are sent to thee, howe often would I haue gathered thy children together, as the henne gathereth her brood vnder her wings, and ye would not! 
\v 35 Beholde, your house is left vnto you desolate: and verely I tell you, ye shall not see me vntill the time come that ye shall say, Blessed is he that commeth in the Name of the Lord. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1 And it came to passe that when he was entred into the house of one of the chiefe Pharises on the Sabbath day, to eate bread, they watched him. 
\v 2 And beholde, there was a certaine man before him, which had the dropsie. 
\v 3 Then Iesus answering, spake vnto the Lawyers and Pharises, saying, Is it lawfull to heale on the Sabbath day? 
\v 4 And they held their peace. Then he tooke him, and healed him, and let him goe, 
\v 5 And answered them, saying, Which of you shall haue an asse, or an oxe fallen into a pit, and wil not straightway pull him out on the Sabbath day? 
\v 6 And they could not answere him againe to those things. 
\v 7 He spake also a parable to the ghestes, when he marked howe they chose out the chiefe roomes, and said vnto them, 
\v 8 When thou shalt be bidden of any man to a wedding, set not thy selfe downe in the chiefest place, lest a more honourable man then thou, be bidden of him, 
\v 9 And he that bade both him and thee, come, and say to thee, Giue this man roome, and thou then begin with shame to take the lowest roome. 
\v 10 But when thou art bidden, goe and sit downe in the lowest roome, that when he that bade thee, cometh, he may say vnto thee, Friende, sit vp hier: then shalt thou haue worship in the presence of them that sit at table with thee. 
\v 11 For whosoeuer exalteth himselfe, shall be brought lowe, and he that humbleth himselfe, shall be exalted. 
\v 12 Then said he also to him that had bidden him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friendes, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsemen, nor ye riche neighbours, lest they also bid thee againe, and a recompence be made thee. 
\v 13 But when thou makest a feast, call ye poore, the maimed, the lame, and the blind, 
\v 14 And thou shalt be blessed, because they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the iust. 
\v 15 Nowe when one of them that sate at table, heard these things, he said vnto him, Blessed is he that eateth bread in the kingdome of God. 
\v 16 Then saide he to him, A certaine man made a great supper, and bade many, 
\v 17 And sent his seruant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come: for all things are nowe readie. 
\v 18 But they all with one mind beganne to make excuse: The first saide vnto him, I haue bought a farme, and I must needes goe out and see it: I pray thee, haue me excused. 
\v 19 And another said, I haue bought fiue yoke of oxen, and I goe to proue them: I pray thee, haue me excused. 
\v 20 And another said, I haue maried a wife, and therefore I can not come. 
\v 21 So that seruaunt returned, and shewed his master these thinges. Then was the good man of the house angrie, and said to his seruant, Goe out quickely into the streetes and lanes of the citie, and bring in hither the poore, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blinde. 
\v 22 And the seruaunt saide, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is roome. 
\v 23 Then the master sayd to the seruaunt, Goe out into the hie wayes, and hedges, and compell them to come in, that mine house may bee filled. 
\v 24 For I say vnto you, that none of those men which were bidden, shall taste of my supper. 
\v 25 Nowe there went great multitudes with him, and he turned and sayd vnto them, 
\v 26 If any man come to mee, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters: yea, and his owne life also, he can not be my disciple. 
\v 27 And whosoeuer beareth not his crosse, and commeth after mee, can not bee my disciple. 
\v 28 For which of you minding to builde a towre, sitteth not downe before, and counteth the cost, whether hee haue sufficient to performe it, 
\v 29 Lest that after he hath laide the foundation, and is not able to performe it, all that behold it, begin to mocke him, 
\v 30 Saying, This man began to builde, and was not able to make an end? 
\v 31 Or what King going to make warre against another King, sitteth not downe first, and taketh counsell, whether he be able with ten thousande, to meete him that commeth against him with twentie thousand? 
\v 32 Or els while hee is yet a great way off, hee sendeth an ambassage, and desireth peace. 
\v 33 So likewise, whosoeuer hee be of you, that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple. 
\v 34 Salt is good: but if salt haue lost his sauour, wherewith shall it be salted? 
\v 35 It is neither meete for the land, nor yet for the dunghill, but men cast it out. He that hath eares to heare, let him heare. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1 Then resorted vnto him all the Publicanes and sinners, to heare him. 
\v 2 Therefore the Pharises and Scribes murmured, saying, Hee receiueth sinners, and eateth with them. 
\v 3 Then spake hee this parable to them, saying, 
\v 4 What man of you hauing an hundreth sheepe, if hee lose one of them, doeth not leaue ninetie and nine in the wildernesse, and goe after that which is lost, vntill he finde it? 
\v 5 And when he hath found it, he laieth it on his shoulders with ioye. 
\v 6 And when he commeth home, he calleth together his friendes and neighbours, saying vnto them, Reioyce with mee: for I haue founde my sheepe which was lost. 
\v 7 I say vnto you, that likewise ioy shall be in heauen for one sinner that conuerteth, more then for ninetie and nine iust men, which neede none amendment of life. 
\v 8 Either what woman hauing ten groates, if she lose one groate, doth not light a candle, and sweepe the house, and seeke diligently till shee finde it? 
\v 9 And when shee hath found it, shee calleth her friendes, and neighbours, saying, Reioyce with me: for I haue found the groate which I had lost. 
\v 10 Likewise I say vnto you, there is ioy in the presence of the Angels of God, for one sinner that conuerteth. 
\v 11 He sayde moreouer, A certaine man had two sonnes. 
\v 12 And the yonger of them sayde to his father, Father, giue mee the portion of the goods that falleth to mee. So he deuided vnto them his substance. 
\v 13 So not many daies after, when the yonger sonne had gathered all together, hee tooke his iourney into a farre countrey, and there hee wasted his goods with riotous liuing. 
\v 14 Nowe when hee had spent all, there arose a great dearth throughout that land, and he began to be in necessitie. 
\v 15 Then hee went and claue to a citizen of that conntrey, and hee sent him to his farme, to feede swine. 
\v 16 And hee would faine haue filled his bellie with the huskes, that the swine ate: but no man gaue them him. 
\v 17 Then he came to him selfe, and said, Howe many hired seruaunts at my fathers haue bread ynough, and I die for hunger? 
\v 18 I wil rise and goe to my father, and say vnto him, Father, I haue sinned against heaue, and before thee, 
\v 19 And am no more worthy to be called thy sonne: make me as one of thy hired seruants. 
\v 20 So hee arose and came to his father, and when hee was yet a great way off, his father sawe him, and had compassion, and ranne and fell on his necke, and kissed him. 
\v 21 And the sonne sayde vnto him, Father, I haue sinned against heauen, and before thee, and am no more worthie to be called thy sonne. 
\v 22 Then the father said to his seruaunts, Bring foorth the best robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feete, 
\v 23 And bring the fat calfe, and kill him, and let vs eate, and be merie: 
\v 24 For this my sonne was dead, and is aliue againe: and he was lost, but he is found. And they began to be merie. 
\v 25 Nowe the elder brother was in the fielde, and when he came and drewe neere to the house, he heard melodie, and dauncing, 
\v 26 And called one of his seruaunts, and asked what those things meant. 
\v 27 And hee sayde vnto him, Thy brother is come, and thy father hath killed the fatte calfe, because he hath receiued him safe and sound. 
\v 28 Then he was angry, and would not goe in: therefore came his father out and entreated him. 
\v 29 But he answered and said to his father, Loe, these many yeeres haue I done thee seruice, neither brake I at any time thy commadement, and yet thou neuer gauest mee a kidde that I might make merie with my friends. 
\v 30 But when this thy sonne was come, which hath deuoured thy good with harlots, thou hast for his sake killed the fat calfe. 
\v 31 And he said vnto him, Sonne, thou art euer with me, and al that I haue, is thine. It was meete that we shoulde make merie, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is aliue againe: and hee was lost, but he is found. 
\c 16  
\p
\v 1 And he sayde also vnto his disciples, There was a certaine riche man, which had a stewarde, and he was accused vnto him, that he wasted his goods. 
\v 2 And hee called him, and saide vnto him, Howe is it that I heare this of thee? Giue an accounts of thy stewardship: for thou maiest be no longer steward. 
\v 3 Then the stewarde saide within himselfe, What shall I doe? for my master taketh away from me the stewardship. I cannot digge, and to begge I am ashamed. 
\v 4 I knowe what I will doe, that when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receiue mee into their houses. 
\v 5 Then called he vnto him euery one of his masters detters, and said vnto the first, Howe much owest thou vnto my master? 
\v 6 And he said, An hudreth measures of oyle. And he saide to him, Take thy writing, and sitte downe quickely, and write fiftie. 
\v 7 Then said he to another, How much owest thou? And hee sayde, An hundreth measures of wheate. Then he saide to him, Take thy writing, and write foure score. 
\v 8 And the Lord commended the vniust stewarde, because he had done wisely. Wherefore the children of this worlde are in their generation wiser then the children of light. 
\v 9 And I say vnto you, Make you friends with the riches of iniquitie, that when ye shall want, they may receiue you into euerlasting habitations. 
\v 10 He that is faithfull in the least, hee is also faithful in much: and he that is vniust in the least, is vniust also in much. 
\v 11 If then ye haue not ben faithful in the wicked riches, who wil trust you in the true treasure? 
\v 12 And if ye haue not bene faithfull in another mans goods, who shall giue you that which is yours? 
\v 13 No seruaunt can serue two masters: for either he shall hate the one, and loue the other: or els he shall leane to the one, and despise the other. Yee can not serue God and riches. 
\v 14 All these thinges heard the Pharises also which were couetous, and they scoffed at him. 
\v 15 Then he sayde vnto them, Yee are they, which iustifie your selues before men: but God knoweth your heartes: for that which is highly esteemed among men, is abomination in the sight of God. 
\v 16 The Lawe and the Prophets endured vntill Iohn: and since that time the kingdome of God is preached, and euery man preasseth into it. 
\v 17 Nowe it is more easie that heauen and earth shoulde passe away, then that one title of the Lawe should fall. 
\v 18 Whosoeuer putteth away his wife, and marieth another, committeth adulterie: and whosoeuer marieth her that is put away from her husband, committeth adulterie. 
\v 19 There was a certaine riche man, which was clothed in purple and fine linnen, and fared well and delicately euery day. 
\v 20 Also there was a certaine begger named Lazarus, which was laide at his gate full of sores, 
\v 21 And desired to bee refreshed with the crommes that fell from the riche mans table: yea, and the dogges came and licked his sores. 
\v 22 And it was so that the begger died, and was caried by the Angels into Abrahams bosome. The rich man also died, and was buried. 
\v 23 And being in hell in torments, he lift vp his eyes, and sawe Abraham a farre off, and Lazarus in his bosome. 
\v 24 Then he cried, and saide, Father Abraham, haue mercie on mee, and sende Lazarus that hee may dippe the tip of his finger in water, and coole my tongue: for I am tormented in this flame. 
\v 25 But Abraham saide, Sonne, remember that thou in thy life time receiuedst thy pleasures, and likewise Lazarus paines: now therefore is he comforted, and thou art tormented. 
\v 26 Besides all this, betweene you and vs there is a great gulfe set, so that they which would goe from hence to you, can not: neither can they come from thence to vs. 
\v 27 Then he said, I pray thee therfore, father, that thou wouldest sende him to my fathers house, 
\v 28 (For I haue fiue brethren) that he may testifie vnto them, least they also come into this place of torment. 
\v 29 Abraham said vnto him, They haue Moses and the Prophets: let them heare them. 
\v 30 And he sayde, Nay, father Abraham: but if one came vnto them from the dead, they will amend their liues. 
\v 31 Then he saide vnto him, If they heare not Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rise from the dead againe. 
\c 17  
\p
\v 1 Then said he to his disciples, It can not be auoided, but that offences will come, but wo be to him by whome they come. 
\v 2 It is better for him that a great milstone were hanged about his necke, and that he were cast into ye sea, then that he should offende one of these litle ones. 
\v 3 Take heede to your selues: if thy brother trespasse against thee, rebuke him: and if hee repent, forgiue him. 
\v 4 And though he sinne against thee seuen times in a day, and seuen times in a day turne againe to thee, saying, It repenteth mee, thou shalt forgiue him. 
\v 5 And the Apostles saide vnto the Lord, Increase our faith. 
\v 6 And the Lord said, If ye had faith, as much as is a graine of mustard seede, and should say vnto this mulberie tree, Plucke thy selfe vp by the rootes, and plant thy selfe in the sea, it should euen obey you. 
\v 7 Who is it also of you, that hauing a seruant plowing or feeding cattell, woulde say vnto him by and by, when hee were come from the fielde, Goe, and sit downe at table? 
\v 8 And woulde not rather say to him, Dresse wherewith I may suppe, and girde thy selfe, and serue mee, till I haue eaten and drunken, and afterward eate thou, and drinke thou? 
\v 9 Doeth he thanke that seruant, because hee did that which was commanded vnto him? I trowe not. 
\v 10 So likewise yee, when yee haue done all those things, which are commanded you, say, We are vnprofitable seruants: wee haue done that which was our duetie to doe. 
\v 11 And so it was when he went to Hierusalem, that he passed through the middes of Samaria, and Galile. 
\v 12 And as hee entred into a certaine towne, there met him tenne men that were lepers, which stoode a farre off. 
\v 13 And they lift vp their voyces and saide, Iesus, Master, haue mercie on vs. 
\v 14 And when he saw them, he said vnto them, Goe, shewe your selues vnto the Priestes. And it came to passe, that as they went, they were clensed. 
\v 15 Then one of them, when hee sawe that hee, was healed, turned backe, and with a loude voyce praised God, 
\v 16 And fell downe on his face at his feete, and gaue him thankes: and he was a Samaritan. 
\v 17 And Iesus answered, and said, Are there not tenne clensed? but where are the nine? 
\v 18 There is none founde that returned to giue God praise, saue this stranger. 
\v 19 And he saide vnto him, Arise, goe thy way, thy faith hath saued thee. 
\v 20 And when hee was demaunded of the Pharises, when the kingdome of God shoulde come, he answered them, and said, The kingdome of God commeth not with obseruation. 
\v 21 Neither shall men say, Loe here, or lo there: for behold, the kingdome of God is within you. 
\v 22 And he saide vnto the disciples, The dayes will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the dayes of the Sonne of man, and ye shall not see it. 
\v 23 Then they shall say to you, Behold here, or beholde there: but goe not thither, neither follow them. 
\v 24 For as the lightening that lighteneth out of the one part vnder heauen, shineth vnto the other part vnder heauen, so shall the Sonne of man be in his day. 
\v 25 But first must he suffer many things, and be reprooued of this generation. 
\v 26 And as it was in the dayes of Noe, so shall it be in the dayes of the Sonne of man. 
\v 27 They ate, they dranke, they married wiues, and gaue in marriage vnto the day that Noe went into the Arke: and the flood came, and destroyed them all. 
\v 28 Likewise also, as it was in the dayes of Lot: they ate, they dranke, they bought, they solde, they planted, they built. 
\v 29 But in the day that Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heauen, and destroyed them all. 
\v 30 After these ensamples shall it be in the day when the Sonne of man is reueiled. 
\v 31 At that day hee that is vpon the house, and his stuffe in ye house, let him not come downe to take it out: and he that is in the fielde likewise, let him not turne backe to that he left behinde. 
\v 32 Remember Lots wife. 
\v 33 Whosoeuer will seeke to saue his soule, shall loose it: and whosoeuer shall loose it, shall get it life. 
\v 34 I tell you, in that night there shall be two in one bed: the one shalbe receiued, and the other shalbe left. 
\v 35 Two women shalbe grinding together: the one shalbe taken, and the other shalbe left. 
\v 36 Two shalbe in the fielde: one shalbe receiued, and another shalbe left. 
\v 37 And they answered, and saide to him, Where, Lord? And he said vnto them, Wheresoeuer the body is, thither shall also the eagles bee gathered together. 
\c 18  
\p
\v 1 And he spake also a parable vnto them, to this ende, that they ought alwayes to pray, and not to waxe faint, 
\v 2 Saying, There was a iudge in a certaine citie, which feared not God, neither reuereced man. 
\v 3 And there was a widowe in that citie, which came vnto him, saying, Doe mee iustice against mine aduersarie. 
\v 4 And hee would not of a long time: but afterward he said with himselfe, Though I feare not God, nor reuerence man, 
\v 5 Yet because this widowe troubleth mee, I will doe her right, lest at the last shee come and make me wearie. 
\v 6 And the Lord said, Heare what the vnrighteous iudge saith. 
\v 7 Now shall not God auenge his elect, which cry day and night vnto him, yea, though he suffer long for them? 
\v 8 I tell you he will auenge them quickly: but when the Sonne of man commeth, shall he finde faith on the earth? 
\v 9 He spake also this parable vnto certaine which trusted in themselues that they were iust, and despised other. 
\v 10 Two men went vp into the Temple to pray: the one a Pharise, and the other a Publican. 
\v 11 The Pharise stoode and prayed thus with himselfe, O God, I thanke thee that I am not as other men, extortioners, vniust, adulterers, or euen as this Publican. 
\v 12 I fast twise in the weeke: I giue tithe of all that euer I possesse. 
\v 13 But the Publican standing a farre off, woulde not lift vp so much as his eyes to heauen, but smote his brest, saying, O God, be mercifull to me a sinner. 
\v 14 I tell you, this man departed to his house iustified, rather then the other: for euery man that exalteth himselfe, shall be brought lowe, and he that humbleth himselfe, shalbe exalted. 
\v 15 They brought vnto him also babes that he should touche them. And when his disciples sawe it, they rebuked them. 
\v 16 But Iesus called them vnto him, and said, Suffer the babes to come vnto mee, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdome of God. 
\v 17 Verely I say vnto you, whosoeuer receiueth not the kingdome of God as a babe, he shall not enter therein. 
\v 18 Then a certaine ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what ought I to doe, to inherite eternall life? 
\v 19 And Iesus said vnto him, Why callest thou me good? none is good, saue one, euen God. 
\v 20 Thou knowest the comandements, Thou shalt not commit adulterie: Thou shalt not kill: Thou shalt not steale: Thou shalt not beare false witnes: Honour thy father and thy mother. 
\v 21 And hee saide, All these haue I kept from my youth. 
\v 22 Nowe when Iesus heard that, he saide vnto him, Yet lackest thou one thing. Sell all that euer thou hast, and distribute vnto the poore, and thou shalt haue treasure in heauen, and come follow mee. 
\v 23 But when he heard those things, he was very heauie: for he was marueilous riche. 
\v 24 And when Iesus sawe him very sorowfull, he said, With what difficultie shall they that haue riches, enter into the kingdome of God! 
\v 25 Surely it is easier for a camel to go through a needles eye, then for a riche man to enter into the kingdome of God. 
\v 26 Then said they that heard it, And who then can be saued? 
\v 27 And he said, The things which are vnpossible with men, are possible with God. 
\v 28 Then Peter said, Loe, we haue left all, and haue followed thee. 
\v 29 And he said vnto them, Verely I say vnto you, there is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children for the kingdome of Gods sake, 
\v 30 Which shall not receiue much more in this world, and in the world to come life euerlasting. 
\v 31 Then Iesus tooke vnto him ye twelue, and said vnto them, Beholde, we goe vp to Hierusalem, and all things shalbe fulfilled to the Sonne of man, that are writttn by the Prophets. 
\v 32 For he shall be deliuered vnto the Gentiles, and shalbe mocked, and shalbe spitefully entreated, and shalbe spitted on. 
\v 33 And when they haue scourged him, they will put him to death: but the thirde day hee shall rise againe. 
\v 34 But they vnderstood none of these things, and this saying was hidde from them, neither perceiued they the things, which were spoken. 
\v 35 And it came to passe, that as he was come neere vnto Iericho, a certaine blinde man sate by the way side, begging. 
\v 36 And when he heard the people passe by, he asked what it meant. 
\v 37 And they saide vnto him, that Iesus of Nazareth passed by. 
\v 38 Then hee cried, saying, Iesus the Sonne of Dauid, haue mercie on me. 
\v 39 And they which went before, rebuked him that he shoulde holde his peace, but he cried much more, O Sone of Dauid, haue mercie on me. 
\v 40 And Iesus stoode stil, and commanded him to be brought vnto him. And when he was come neere, he asked him, 
\v 41 Saying, What wilt thou that I doe vnto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receiue my sight. 
\v 42 And Iesus said vnto him, Receiue thy sight: thy faith hath saued thee. 
\v 43 Then immediatly he receiued his sight, and followed him, praysing God: and all the people, when they sawe this, gaue praise to God. 
\c 19  
\p
\v 1 Now when Iesus entred and passed through Iericho, 
\v 2 Beholde, there was a man named Zaccheus, which was the chiefe receiuer of the tribute, and he was riche. 
\v 3 And he sought to see Iesus, who hee should be, and coulde not for the preasse, because he was of a lowe stature. 
\v 4 Wherefore he ranne before, and climed vp into a wilde figge tree, that he might see him: for he should come that way. 
\v 5 And when Iesus came to the place, he looked vp, and saw him, and said vnto him, Zaccheus, come downe at once: for to day I must abide at thine house. 
\v 6 Then he came downe hastily, and receiued him ioyfully. 
\v 7 And when all they sawe it, they murmured, saying, that hee was gone in to lodge with a sinfull man. 
\v 8 And Zaccheus stood forth, and said vnto the Lord, Beholde, Lord, the halfe of my goods I giue to the poore: and if I haue taken from any man by forged cauillation, I restore him foure folde. 
\v 9 Then Iesus said to him, This day is saluation come vnto this house, forasmuch as hee is also become the sonne of Abraham. 
\v 10 For the Sonne of man is come to seeke, and to saue that which was lost. 
\v 11 And whiles they heard these thinges, hee continued and spake a parable, because hee was neere to Hierusalem, and because also they thought that the kingdom of God should shortly appeare. 
\v 12 He saide therefore, A certaine noble man went into a farre countrey, to receiue for himselfe a kingdome, and so to come againe. 
\v 13 And he called his ten seruants, and deliuered them ten pieces of money, and sayd vnto them, Occupie till I come. 
\v 14 Nowe his citizens hated him, and sent an ambassage after him, saying, We will not haue this man to reigne ouer vs. 
\v 15 And it came to passe, when hee was come againe, and had receiued his kingdome, that he commanded the seruants to be called to him, to whome he gaue his money, that he might knowe what euery man had gained. 
\v 16 Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy piece hath encreased ten pieces. 
\v 17 And he sayd vnto him, Well, good seruant: because thou hast bene faithfull in a very litle thing, take thou authoritie ouer ten cities. 
\v 18 And the second came, saying, Lord, thy piece hath encreased fiue pieces. 
\v 19 And to the same he sayd, Be thou also ruler ouer fiue cities. 
\v 20 So the other came, and sayd, Lord, beholde thy piece, which I haue laide vp in a napkin: 
\v 21 For I feared thee, because thou art a straight man: thou takest vp, that thou layedst not downe, and reapest that thou diddest not sowe. 
\v 22 Then he sayde vnto him, Of thine owne mouth will I iudge thee, O euill seruant. Thou knewest that I am a straight man, taking vp that I layd not downe, and reaping that I did not sowe. 
\v 23 Wherefore then gauest not thou my money into the banke, that at my coming I might haue required it with vantage? 
\v 24 And he sayd to them that stoode by, Take from him that piece, and giue it him that hath ten pieces. 
\v 25 (And they sayd vnto him, Lord, hee hath ten pieces.) 
\v 26 For I say vnto you, that vnto all them that haue, it shalbe giuen: and from him that hath not, euen that he hath, shalbe taken from him. 
\v 27 Moreouer, those mine enemies, which would not that I should reigne ouer them, bring hither, and slay them before me. 
\v 28 And when he had thus spoken, he went forth before, ascending vp to Hierusalem. 
\v 29 And it came to passe, when hee was come neere to Bethphage, and Bethania, besides the mount which is called the mount of Oliues, he sent two of his disciples, 
\v 30 Saying, Goe ye to the towne which is before you, wherein, assoone as ye are come, ye shall finde a colte tied, whereon neuer man sate: loose him, and bring him hither. 
\v 31 And if any man aske you, why ye loose him, thus shall ye say vnto him, Because the Lord hath neede of him. 
\v 32 So they that were sent, went their way, and found it as he had sayd vnto them. 
\v 33 And as they were loosing the colte, the owners thereof sayd vnto them, Why loose ye the colte? 
\v 34 And they sayd, The Lord hath neede of him. 
\v 35 So they brought him to Iesus, and they cast their garments on the colte, and set Iesus thereon. 
\v 36 And as he went, they spred their clothes in the way. 
\v 37 And when he was nowe come neere to the going downe of the mount of Oliues, the whole multitude of the disciples began to reioyce, and to prayse God with a loude voyce, for all the great workes that they had seene, 
\v 38 Saying, Blessed be the King that commeth in the Name of the Lord: peace in heauen, and glory in the highest places. 
\v 39 Then some of the Pharises of the companie sayd vnto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples. 
\v 40 But he answered, and sayd vnto them, I tell you, that if these should holde their peace, the stones would crie. 
\v 41 And when he was come neere, he behelde the Citie, and wept for it, 
\v 42 Saying, O if thou haddest euen knowen at the least in this thy day those things, which belong vnto thy peace! but nowe are they hid from thine eyes. 
\v 43 For the dayes shall come vpon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compasse thee round, and keepe thee in on euery side, 
\v 44 And shall make thee euen with ye ground, and thy children which are in thee, and they shall not leaue in thee a stone vpon a stone, because thou knewest not that season of thy visitation. 
\v 45 He went also into the Temple, and began to cast out them that solde therein, and them that bought, 
\v 46 Saying vnto them, It is written, Mine house is the house of prayer, but ye haue made it a denne of theeues. 
\v 47 And he taught dayly in the Temple. And the hie Priests and the Scribes, and the chiefe of the people sought to destroy him. 
\v 48 But they could not finde what they might doe to him: for all the people hanged vpon him when they heard him. 
\c 20  
\p
\v 1 And it came to passe, that on one of those dayes, as he taught the people in the Temple, and preached the Gospel, the hie Priests and the Scribes came vpon him with the Elders, 
\v 2 And spake vnto him, saying, Tell vs by what authoritie thou doest these things, or who is hee that hath giuen thee this authoritie? 
\v 3 And he answered, and sayde vnto them, I also will aske you one thing: tell me therefore: 
\v 4 The baptisme of Iohn, was it from heauen, or of men? 
\v 5 And they reasoned within themselues, saying, If we shall say, From heauen, he will say, Why then beleeued ye him not? 
\v 6 But if we shall say, Of men, all the people will stone vs: for they be perswaded that Iohn was a Prophet. 
\v 7 Therefore they answered, that they could not tell whence it was. 
\v 8 Then Iesus sayd vnto them, Neither tell I you, by what authoritie I doe these things. 
\v 9 Then began he to speake to ye people this parable, A certaine man planted a vineyarde, and let it forth to husbandmen: and went into a strange countrey, for a great time. 
\v 10 And at the time conuenient he sent a seruant to the husbandmen, that they should giue him of the fruite of the vineyard: but the husbandmen did beate him, and sent him away emptie. 
\v 11 Againe he sent yet another seruant: and they did beate him, and foule entreated him, and sent him away emptie. 
\v 12 Moreouer he sent the third, and him they wounded, and cast out. 
\v 13 Then sayd the Lord of the vineyard, What shall I doe? I will send my beloued sonne: it may be that they will doe reuerence, when they see him. 
\v 14 But when the husbandmen sawe him, they reasoned with themselues, saying, This is the heire: come, let vs kill him, that the inheritance may be ours. 
\v 15 So they cast him out of the vineyarde, and killed him. What shall the Lord of the vineyarde therefore doe vnto them? 
\v 16 He will come and destroy these husbandmen, and wil giue out his vineyard to others. But when they heard it, they sayd, God forbid. 
\v 17 And he beheld them, and said, What meaneth this then that is written, The stone that the builders refused, that is made the head of the corner? 
\v 18 Whosoeuer shall fall vpon that stone, shall be broken: and on whomsoeuer it shall fall, it will grinde him to pouder. 
\v 19 Then the hie Priests, and the Scribes the same houre went about to lay hands on him: (but they feared the people) for they perceiued that he had spoken this parable against them. 
\v 20 And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should faine themselues iust men, to take him in his talke, and to deliuer him vnto the power and authoritie of the gouernour. 
\v 21 And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest, and teachest right, neither doest thou accept mans person, but teachest the way of God truely. 
\v 22 Is it lawfull for vs to giue Cesar tribute or no? 
\v 23 But he perceiued their craftines, and sayd vnto them, Why tempt ye me? 
\v 24 Shew me a penie. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answered, and sayd, Cesars. 
\v 25 Then he sayd vnto them, Giue then vnto Cesar the things which are Cesars, and to God those which are Gods. 
\v 26 And they could not reproue his saying before the people: but they marueiled at his answere, and helde their peace. 
\v 27 Then came to him certaine of the Sadduces (which denie that there is any resurrection) and they asked him, 
\v 28 Saying, Master, Moses wrote vnto vs, If any mans brother die hauing a wife, and hee die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise vp seede vnto his brother. 
\v 29 Now there were seuen brethren, and the first tooke a wife, and he dyed without children. 
\v 30 And the second tooke the wife, and he dyed childelesse. 
\v 31 Then the third tooke her: and so likewise the seuen dyed, and left no children. 
\v 32 And last of all the woman dyed also. 
\v 33 Therefore at the resurrection, whose wife of them shall she be? for seuen had her to wife. 
\v 34 Then Iesus answered, and sayd vnto them, The children of this world marry wiues, and are married. 
\v 35 But they which shalbe counted worthy to enioy that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry wiues, neither are married. 
\v 36 For they can die no more, forasmuch as they are equall vnto the Angels, and are the sonnes of God, since they are the children of the resurrection. 
\v 37 And that the dead shall rise againe, euen Moses shewed it besides the bush, when he said, The Lord is the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Iacob. 
\v 38 For he is not the God of the dead, but of them which liue: for all liue vnto him. 
\v 39 Then certaine of the Scribes answered, and sayd, Master, thou hast well sayd. 
\v 40 And after that, durst they not aske him any thing at all. 
\v 41 Then sayd he vnto them, Howe say they that Christ is Dauids sonne? 
\v 42 And Dauid himselfe sayth in the booke of the Psalmes, The Lord sayd vnto my Lord, Sit at my right hand, 
\v 43 Till I shall make thine enemies thy footestoole. 
\v 44 Seeing Dauid called him Lord, howe is he then his sonne? 
\v 45 Then in the audience of all the people he sayd vnto his disciples, 
\v 46 Beware of the Scribes, which willingly go in long robes, and loue salutations in the markets, and the highest seates in the assemblies, and the chiefe roomes at feastes: 
\v 47 Which deuoure widowes houses, and in shewe make long prayers: These shall receiue greater damnation. 
\c 21  
\p
\v 1 And as he behelde, he sawe the rich men, which cast their giftes into the treasurie. 
\v 2 And he sawe also a certaine poore widowe which cast in thither two mites: 
\v 3 And he sayd, Of a trueth I say vnto you, that this poore widowe hath cast in more then they all. 
\v 4 For they all haue of their superfluitie cast into the offerings of God: but she of her penurie hath cast in all the liuing that she had. 
\v 5 Nowe as some spake of the Temple, how it was garnished with goodly stones, and with consecrate things, he sayd, 
\v 6 Are these ye things that ye looke vpon? the dayes will come wherein a stone shall not be left vpon a stone, that shall not be throwen downe. 
\v 7 Then they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what signe shall there be when these things shall come to passe? 
\v 8 And he sayd, Take heede, that ye be not deceiued: for many will come in my Name, saying, I am Christ, and the time draweth neere: follow ye not them therefore. 
\v 9 And when ye heare of warres and seditions, be not afraid: for these things must first come, but the ende foloweth not by and by. 
\v 10 Then said hee vnto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdome against kingdome, 
\v 11 And great earthquakes shall be in diuers places, and hunger, and pestilence, and fearefull things, and great signes shall there be from heauen. 
\v 12 But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute you, deliuering you vp to the assemblies, and into prisons, and bring you before Kings and rulers for my Names sake. 
\v 13 And this shall turne to you, for a testimoniall. 
\v 14 Lay it vp therefore in your heartes, that ye cast not before hand, what ye shall answere. 
\v 15 For I will giue you a mouth and wisdome, where against all your aduersaries shall not be able to speake, nor resist. 
\v 16 Yea, ye shalbe betrayed also of your parents, and of your brethren, and kinsmen, and friendes, and some of you shall they put to death. 
\v 17 And ye shall bee hated of all men for my Names sake. 
\v 18 Yet there shall not one heare of your heads perish. 
\v 19 By your patience possesse your soules. 
\v 20 And when ye see Hierusalem besieged with souldiers, then vnderstand that the desolation thereof is neere. 
\v 21 Then let them which are in Iudea, flee to the mountaines: and let them which are in the middes thereof, depart out: and let not them that are in the countrey, enter therein. 
\v 22 For these be the dayes of vengeance, to fulfill all things that are written. 
\v 23 But woe be to them that be with childe, and to them that giue sucke in those dayes: for there shalbe great distresse in this land, and wrath ouer this people. 
\v 24 And they shall fall on the edge of the sword, and shalbe led captiue into all nations, and Hierusalem shalbe troden vnder foote of the Gentiles, vntill the time of the Gentiles be fulfilled. 
\v 25 Then there shalbe signes in the sunne, and in the moone, and in the starres, and vpon the earth trouble among the nations with perplexitie: the sea and the waters shall roare. 
\v 26 And mens hearts shall faile them for feare, and for looking after those thinges which shall come on the worlde: for the powers of heauen shall be shaken. 
\v 27 And then shall they see the Sonne of man come in a cloude, with power and great glory. 
\v 28 And when these things beginne to come to passe, then looke vp, and lift vp your heades: for your redemption draweth neere. 
\v 29 And he spake to them a parable, Behold, the figge tree, and all trees, 
\v 30 When they nowe shoote foorth, ye seeing them, knowe of your owne selues, that sommer is then neere. 
\v 31 So likewise yee, when yee see these thinges come to passe, knowe ye that the kingdome of God is neere. 
\v 32 Verely I say vnto you, This age shall not passe, till all these things be done: 
\v 33 Heauen and earth shall passe away, but my wordes shall not passe away. 
\v 34 Take heede to your selues, lest at any time your hearts be oppressed with surfeting and drunkennesse, and cares of this life, and least that day come on you at vnwares. 
\v 35 For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth. 
\v 36 Watche therefore, and pray continually, that ye may be counted worthy to escape all these thinges that shall come to passe, and that ye may stand before the Sonne of man. 
\v 37 Nowe in the day time hee taught in the Temple, and at night hee went out, and abode in the mount that is called the mount of Oliues. 
\v 38 And all the people came in the morning to him, to heare him in the Temple. 
\c 22  
\p
\v 1 Now the feast of vnleauened bread drewe neere, which is called the Passeouer. 
\v 2 And the hie Priests and Scribes sought how they might kill him: for they feared the people. 
\v 3 Then entred Satan into Iudas, who was called Iscariot, and was of the nomber of the twelue. 
\v 4 And he went his way, and communed with the hie Priestes and captaines, how he might betray him to them. 
\v 5 So they were glad, and agreed to giue him money. 
\v 6 And he consented, and sought opportunitie to betraye him vnto them, when the people were away. 
\v 7 Then came the day of vnleauened bread, when the Passeouer must be sacrificed. 
\v 8 And he sent Peter and Iohn, saying, Go and prepare vs the Passeouer, that we may eate it. 
\v 9 And they saide to him, Where wilt thou, that we prepare it? 
\v 10 Then he said vnto them, Beholde, when ye be entred into the citie, there shall a man meete you, bearing a pitcher of water: folowe him into the house that he entreth in, 
\v 11 And say vnto the good man of the house, The Master saith vnto thee, Where is the lodging where I shall eate my Passeouer with my disciples? 
\v 12 Then he shall shewe you a great hie chamber trimmed: there make it ready. 
\v 13 So they went, and found as he had said vnto them, and made readie the Passeouer. 
\v 14 And when the houre was come, hee sate downe, and the twelue Apostles with him. 
\v 15 Then he saide vnto them, I haue earnestly desired to eate this Passeouer with you, before I suffer. 
\v 16 For I say vnto you, Hencefoorth I will not eate of it any more, vntill it bee fulfilled in the kingdome of God. 
\v 17 And hee tooke the cup, and gaue thankes, and said, Take this, and deuide it among you, 
\v 18 For I say vnto you, I will not drinke of the fruite of the vine, vntill the kingdome of God be come. 
\v 19 And he tooke bread, and when he had giuen thankes, he brake it, and gaue to them, saying, This is my body, which is giuen for you: doe this in the remembrance of me. 
\v 20 Likewise also after supper he tooke the cup, saying, This cup is that newe Testament in my blood, which is shed for you. 
\v 21 Yet beholde, the hand of him that betrayeth me, is with me at the table. 
\v 22 And truely the Sonne of man goeth as it is appointed: but woe be to that man, by whom he is betrayed. 
\v 23 Then they began to enquire among themselues which of them it should be, that should do that. 
\v 24 And there arose also a strife among them, which of them should seeme to be ye greatest. 
\v 25 But hee saide vnto them, The Kings of the Gentiles reigne ouer them, and they that beare rule ouer them, are called bountifull. 
\v 26 But yee shall not be so: but let the greatest among you be as the least: and the chiefest as he that serueth. 
\v 27 For who is greater, he that sitteth at table, or he that serueth? Is not he that sitteth at table? And I am among you as he that serueth. 
\v 28 And yee are they which haue continued with me in my tentations. 
\v 29 Therefore I appoint vnto you a kingdome, as my Father hath appointed vnto me, 
\v 30 That ye may eate, and drinke at my table in my kingdome, and sit on seates, and iudge the twelue tribes of Israel. 
\v 31 And the Lord saide, Simon, Simon, beholde, Satan hath desired you, to winowe you as wheate. 
\v 32 But I haue prayed for thee, that thy faith faile not: therefore when thou art conuerted, strengthen thy brethren. 
\v 33 And he said vnto him, Lord, I am ready to goe with thee into prison, and to death. 
\v 34 But he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cocke shall not crowe this day, before thou hast thrise denied that thou knewest me. 
\v 35 And he saide vnto them, When I sent you without bagge, and scrip, and shooes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing. 
\v 36 Then he said to them, But nowe he that hath a bagge, let him take it, and likewise a scrip: and hee that hath none, let him sell his coate, and buy a sworde. 
\v 37 For I say vnto you, That yet the same which is written, must be perfourmed in me, Euen with the wicked was he nombred: for doubtlesse those things which are written of me, haue an ende. 
\v 38 And they said, Lord, beholde, here are two swordes. And he said vnto them, It is ynough. 
\v 39 And he came out, and went (as he was wont) to the mount of Oliues: and his disciples also followed him. 
\v 40 And when hee came to the place, hee said to them, Pray, lest ye enter into tentation. 
\v 41 And he was drawen aside from them about a stones cast, and kneeled downe, and prayed, 
\v 42 Saying, Father, if thou wilt, take away this cuppe from mee: neuerthelesse, not my will, but thine be done. 
\v 43 And there appeared an Angell vnto him from heauen, comforting him. 
\v 44 But being in an agonie, hee prayed more earnestly: and his sweate was like drops of blood, trickling downe to the ground. 
\v 45 And he rose vp from prayer, and came to his disciples, and found them sleeping for heauinesse. 
\v 46 And he said vnto them, Why sleepe ye? rise and pray, least ye enter into tentation. 
\v 47 And while he yet spake, beholde, a companie, and he that was called Iudas one of the twelue, went before them, and came neere vnto Iesus to kisse him. 
\v 48 And Iesus saide vnto him, Iudas, betrayest thou the Sonne of man with a kisse? 
\v 49 Now when they which were about him, saw what would follow, they said vnto him, Lord, shall we smite with sworde? 
\v 50 And one of them smote a seruant of the hie Priest, and strooke off his right eare. 
\v 51 Then Iesus answered, and said, Suffer them thus farre: and he touched his eare, and healed him. 
\v 52 Then Iesus said vnto the hie Priests, and captaines of the Temple, and the Elders which were come to him, Bee ye come out as vnto a theefe with swordes and staues? 
\v 53 When I was dayly with you in the Temple, yee stretched not foorth the handes against mee: but this is your very houre, and the power of darkenesse. 
\v 54 Then tooke they him, and led him, and brought him to the hie Priestes house. And Peter followed afarre off. 
\v 55 And when they had kindled a fire in the middes of the hall, and were set downe together, Peter also sate downe among them. 
\v 56 And a certaine mayde behelde him as hee sate by the fire, and hauing well looked on him, said, This man was also with him. 
\v 57 But he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not. 
\v 58 And after a little while, another man sawe him, and saide, Thou art also of them. But Peter said, Man, I am not. 
\v 59 And about the space of an houre after, a certaine other affirmed, saying. Verely euen this man was with him: for he is also a Galilean. 
\v 60 And Peter saide, Man, I knowe not what thou sayest. And immediatly while hee yet spake, the cocke crewe. 
\v 61 Then the Lord turned backe, and looked vpon Peter: and Peter remembred the worde of the Lord, how he had said vnto him, Before the cocke crowe, thou shalt denie me thrise. 
\v 62 And Peter went out, and wept bitterly. 
\v 63 And the men that helde Iesus, mocked him, and strooke him. 
\v 64 And when they had blindfolded him, they smote him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophecie who it is that smote thee. 
\v 65 And many other thinges blasphemously spake they against him. 
\v 66 And assoone as it was day, the Elders of the people, and the hie Priests and the Scribes came together, and led him into their councill, 
\v 67 Saying, Art thou that Christ? tell vs. And he said vnto them, If I tell you, ye wil not beleeue it. 
\v 68 And if also I aske you, you will not answere me, nor let me goe. 
\v 69 Hereafter shall the Sonne of man sit at the right hand of the power of God. 
\v 70 Then sayd they all, Art thou then ye Sonne of God? And he sayd to them, Ye say, that I am. 
\v 71 Then sayd they, What neede we any further witnes? for we our selues haue heard it of his owne mouth. 
\c 23  
\p
\v 1 Then the whole multitude of them arose, and led him vnto Pilate. 
\v 2 And they began to accuse him, saying, We haue found this man peruerting the nation, and forbidding to pay tribute to Cesar, saying, That he is Christ a King. 
\v 3 And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Iewes? And hee answered him, and sayd, Thou sayest it. 
\v 4 Then sayd Pilate to the hie Priests, and to the people, I finde no fault in this man. 
\v 5 But they were the more fierce, saying, He moueth the people, teaching throughout all Iudea, beginning at Galile, euen to this place. 
\v 6 Nowe when Pilate heard of Galile, he asked whether the man were a Galilean. 
\v 7 And when he knewe that he was of Herods iurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, which was also at Hierusalem in those dayes. 
\v 8 And when Herod sawe Iesus, hee was exceedingly glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him, and trusted to haue seene some signe done by him. 
\v 9 Then questioned hee with him of many things: but he answered him nothing. 
\v 10 The hie Priests also and Scribes stood forth, and accused him vehemently. 
\v 11 And Herod with his men of warre, despised him, and mocked him, and arayed him in white, and sent him againe to Pilate. 
\v 12 And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were enemies one to another. 
\v 13 Then Pilate called together the hie Priests and the rulers, and the people, 
\v 14 And sayd vnto them, Ye haue brought this man vnto me, as one that peruerted the people: and beholde, I haue examined him before you, and haue found no fault in this man, of those things whereof ye accuse him: 
\v 15 No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him: and loe, nothing worthy of death is done of him. 
\v 16 I will therefore chastise him, and let him loose. 
\v 17 (For of necessitie hee must haue let one loose vnto them at the feast.) 
\v 18 Then all ye multitude cried at once, saying, Away with him, and deliuer vnto vs Barabbas: 
\v 19 Which for a certaine insurrection made in the citie, and murder, was cast in prison. 
\v 20 Then Pilate spake againe to them, willing to let Iesus loose. 
\v 21 But they cried, saying, Crucifie, crucifie him. 
\v 22 And he sayd vnto them the third time, But what euill hath he done? I finde no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him loose. 
\v 23 But they were instant with loude voyces, and required that he might be crucified: and the voyces of them and of the hie Priests preuailed. 
\v 24 So Pilate gaue sentence, that it should be as they required. 
\v 25 And he let loose vnto them him that for insurrection and murder was cast into prison, whome they desired, and deliuered Iesus to doe with him what they would. 
\v 26 And as they led him away, they caught one Simon of Cyrene, comming out of the fielde, and on him they layde the crosse, to beare it after Iesus. 
\v 27 And there followed him a great multitude of people, and of women, which women bewailed and lamented him. 
\v 28 But Iesus turned backe vnto them, and said, Daughters of Hierusalem, weepe not for me, but weepe for your selues, and for your children. 
\v 29 For behold, the dayes wil come, when men shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombes that neuer bare, and the pappes which neuer gaue sucke. 
\v 30 Then shall they begin to say to the mountaines, Fall on vs: and to the hilles, Couer vs. 
\v 31 For if they doe these things to a greene tree, what shalbe done to the drie? 
\v 32 And there were two others, which were euill doers, led with him to be slaine. 
\v 33 And when they were come to the place, which is called Caluarie, there they crucified him, and the euill doers: one at the right hand, and the other at the left. 
\v 34 Then sayd Iesus, Father, forgiue them: for they know not what they doe. And they parted his raiment, and cast lottes. 
\v 35 And the people stoode, and behelde: and the rulers mocked him with them, saying, He saued others: let him saue himselfe, if hee be that Christ, the Chosen of God. 
\v 36 The souldiers also mocked him, and came and offered him vineger, 
\v 37 And said, If thou be the King of the Iewes, saue thy selfe. 
\v 38 And a superscription was also written ouer him, in Greeke letters, and in Latin, and in Hebrewe, THIS IS THAT KING OF THE JEWES. 
\v 39 And one of the euill doers, which were hanged, railed on him, saying, If thou be that Christ, saue thy selfe and vs. 
\v 40 But the other answered, and rebuked him, saying, Fearest thou not God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation? 
\v 41 We are in deede righteously here: for we receiue things worthy of that we haue done: but this man hath done nothing amisse. 
\v 42 And he sayd vnto Iesus, Lord, remember me, when thou commest into thy kingdome. 
\v 43 Then Iesus said vnto him, Verely I say vnto thee, to day shalt thou be with me in Paradise. 
\v 44 And it was about the sixt houre: and there was a darkenes ouer all the land, vntill the ninth houre. 
\v 45 And the Sunne was darkened, and the vaile of the Temple rent through the middes. 
\v 46 And Iesus cryed with a loude voyce, and sayd, Father, into thine hands I commend my spirit. And when hee thus had sayd, hee gaue vp the ghost. 
\v 47 Nowe when the Centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Of a suretie this man was iust. 
\v 48 And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things, which were done, smote their brestes, and returned. 
\v 49 And all his acquaintance stood a farre off, and the women that followed him from Galile, beholding these things. 
\v 50 And beholde, there was a man named Ioseph, which was a counseller, a good man and a iust. 
\v 51 Hee did not consent to the counsell and deede of them, which was of Arimathea, a citie of the Iewes: who also himselfe waited for the kingdome of God. 
\v 52 He went vnto Pilate, and asked the body of Iesus, 
\v 53 And tooke it downe, and wrapped it in a linnen cloth, and laide it in a tombe hewen out of a rocke, wherein was neuer man yet laide. 
\v 54 And that day was the preparation, and the Sabbath drewe on. 
\v 55 And the women also that followed after, which came with him from Galile, behelde the sepulchre, and how his body was layd. 
\v 56 And they returned and prepared odours, and ointments, and rested the Sabbath day according to the commandement. 
\c 24  
\p
\v 1 Nowe the first day of the weeke early in the morning, they came vnto the sepulchre, and brought the odours, which they had prepared, and certaine women with them. 
\v 2 And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre, 
\v 3 And went in, but found not the body of the Lord Iesus. 
\v 4 And it came to passe, that as they were amased thereat, beholde, two men suddenly stood by them in shining vestures. 
\v 5 And as they were afraide, and bowed downe their faces to the earth, they sayd to them, Why seeke ye him that liueth, among the dead? 
\v 6 He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake vnto you, when he was yet in Galile, 
\v 7 Saying, that the sonne of man must be deliuered into the hands of sinfull men, and be crucified, and the third day rise againe. 
\v 8 And they remembred his wordes, 
\v 9 And returned from the sepulchre, and tolde all these things vnto the eleuen, and to all the remnant. 
\v 10 Now it was Mary Magdalene, and Ioanna, and Mary the mother of Iames, and other women with them, which tolde these things vnto the Apostles. 
\v 11 But their wordes seemed vnto them, as a fained thing, neither beleeued they them. 
\v 12 Then arose Peter, and ran vnto the sepulchre, and looked in, and saw the linnen clothes laide by themselues, and departed wondering in himselfe at that which was come to passe. 
\v 13 And beholde, two of them went that same day to a towne which was from Hierusalem about threescore furlongs, called Emmaus. 
\v 14 And they talked together of al these things that were done. 
\v 15 And it came to passe, as they communed together, and reasoned, that Iesus himselfe drewe neere, and went with them. 
\v 16 But their eyes were holden, that they could not know him. 
\v 17 And he sayd vnto them, What maner of communications are these that ye haue one to another as ye walke and are sad? 
\v 18 And the one (named Cleopas) answered, and sayd vnto him, Art thou onely a stranger in Hierusalem, and hast not knowen the things which are come to passe therein in these dayes? 
\v 19 And he said vnto them, What things? And they sayd vnto him, Of Iesus of Nazareth, which was a Prophet, mightie in deede and in word before God, and all people, 
\v 20 And howe the hie Priests, and our rulers deliuered him to be condemned to death, and haue crucified him. 
\v 21 But we trusted that it had bene he that should haue deliuered Israel, and as touching all these things, to day is ye third day, that they were done. 
\v 22 Yea, and certaine women among vs made vs astonied, which came early vnto the sepulchre. 
\v 23 And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seene a vision of Angels, which sayd, that he was aliue. 
\v 24 Therefore certaine of them which were with vs, went to the sepulchre, and found it euen so as the women had sayd, but him they saw not. 
\v 25 Then he sayd vnto them, O fooles and slowe of heart to beleeue all that the Prophets haue spoken! 
\v 26 Ought not Christ to haue suffered these things, and to enter into his glory? 
\v 27 And he began at Moses, and at all the Prophets, and interpreted vnto them in all the Scriptures the things which were written of him. 
\v 28 And they drew neere vnto ye towne, which they went to, but he made as though hee would haue gone further. 
\v 29 But they constrained him, saying, Abide with vs: for it is towards night, and the day is farre spent. So he went in to tarie with them. 
\v 30 And it came to passe, as hee sate at table with them, he tooke the bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gaue it to them. 
\v 31 Then their eyes were opened, and they knewe him: and he was no more seene of them. 
\v 32 And they saide betweene themselues, Did not our heartes burne within vs, while he talked with vs by the way, and when he opened to vs the Scriptures? 
\v 33 And they rose vp the same houre, and returned to Hierusalem, and found the Eleuen gathered together, and them that were with them, 
\v 34 Which said, The Lord is risen in deede, and hath appeared to Simon. 
\v 35 Then they tolde what things were done in the way, and howe he was knowen of them in breaking of bread. 
\v 36 And as they spake these things, Iesus himselfe stoode in the middes of them, and saide vnto them, Peace be to you. 
\v 37 But they were abashed and afraide, supposing that they had seene a spirit. 
\v 38 Then he saide vnto them, Why are ye troubled? and wherefore doe doutes arise in your hearts? 
\v 39 Beholde mine handes and my feete: for it is I my selfe: handle me, and see: for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me haue. 
\v 40 And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and feete. 
\v 41 And while they yet beleeued not for ioy, and wondred, he saide vnto them, Haue ye here any meate? 
\v 42 And they gaue him a piece of a broyled fish, and of an honie combe, 
\v 43 And hee tooke it, and did eate before them. 
\v 44 And he saide vnto them, These are the wordes, which I spake vnto you while I was yet with you, that all must be fulfilled which are written of me in the Lawe of Moses, and in the Prophets, and in the Psalmes. 
\v 45 Then opened he their vnderstanding, that they might vnderstand the Scriptures, 
\v 46 And said vnto them, Thus is it written, and thus it behoued Christ to suffer, and to rise againe from the dead the third day, 
\v 47 And that repentance, and remission of sinnes should be preached in his Name among all nations, beginning at Hierusalem. 
\v 48 Nowe ye are witnesses of these things. 
\v 49 And beholde, I doe sende the promise of my Father vpon you: but tary ye in the citie of Hierusalem, vntill ye be endued with power from an hie. 
\v 50 Afterward he lead them out into Bethania, and lift vp his hands, and blessed them. 
\v 51 And it came to passe, that as he blessed them, he departed from them, and was caried vp into heauen. 
\v 52 And they worshipped him, and returned to Hierusalem with great ioy, 
\v 53 And were continually in the Temple, praysing, and lauding God, Amen.
