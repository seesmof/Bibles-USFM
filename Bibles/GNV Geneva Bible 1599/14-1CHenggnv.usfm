\v 3 And the battel was sore against Saul; and the archers hit him, and he was wounded of the archers. 
\v 4 Then sayde Saul to his armour bearer, Drawe out thy sworde, and thrust me thorowe therewith, lest these vncircumcised come and mocke at me: but his armour bearer would not, for he was sore afraid: therefore Saul tooke the sword and fell vpon it. 
\v 5 And when his armour bearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise vpon the sworde, and dyed. 
\v 6 So Saul dyed and his three sonnes, and all his house, they dyed together. 
\v 7 And when all the men of Israel that were in the valley, sawe how they fledde, and that Saul and his sonnes were dead, they forsooke their cities, and fled away, and the Philistims came, and dwelt in them. 
\v 8 And on the morrowe when the Philistims came to spoyle them that were slaine, they found Saul and his sonnes lying in mount Gilboa.

\v 10 And they layd vp his armour in the house of their god, and set vp his head in the house of Dagon. 
\v 11 When all they of Iabesh Gilead heard all that the Philistims had done to Saul, 
\v 12 Then they arose (all the valiant men) and tooke the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sonnes, and brought them to Iabesh, and buryed the bones of them vnder an oke in Iabesh, and fasted seuen dayes. 
\v 13 So Saul dyed for his transgression, that he committed against the Lord, euen against the word of the Lord, which he kept not, and in that he sought and asked counsel of a familiar spirit, 
\v 14 And asked not of the Lord: therefore he slewe him, and turned the kingdome vnto Dauid the sonne of Ishai. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 Then all Israel gathered themselues to Dauid vnto Hebron, saying, Beholde, we are thy bones and thy flesh. 
\v 2 And in time past, euen when Saul was King, thou leddest Israel out and in: and the Lord thy God sayde vnto thee, Thou shalt feede my people Israel, and thou shalt be captaine ouer my people Israel. 
\v 3 So came all the Elders of Israel to the King to Hebron, and Dauid made a couenant with them in Hebron before the Lord. And they anoynted Dauid King ouer Israel, according to the word of the Lord by the hand of Samuel. 
\v 4 And Dauid and all Israel went to Ierusalem, which is Iebus, where were the Iebusites, the inhabitants of the land.

\v 6 And Dauid sayd, Whosoeuer smiteth the Iebusites first, shalbe the chiefe and captaine. So Ioab the sonne of Zeruiah went first vp, and was captaine. 
\v 7 And Dauid dwelt in the tower: therefore they called it the citie of Dauid. 
\v 8 And he built the citie on euery side, from Millo euen round about, and Ioab repaired the rest of the citie. 
\v 9 And Dauid prospered, and grewe: for the Lord of hostes was with him. 
\v 10 These also are the chiefe of the valiant men that were with Dauid, and ioyned their force with him in his kingdome with al Israel, to make him King ouer Israel, according to the worde of the Lord. 
\v 11 And this is the nomber of the valiant men whome Dauid had, Iashobeam the sonne of Hachmoni, the chiefe among thirtie: he lift vp his speare against three hundreth, whom he slewe at one time. 
\v 12 And after him was Eleazar the sonne of Dodo the Ahohite, which was one of the three valiant men. 
\v 13 He was with Dauid at Pas-dammim, and there the Philistims were gathered together to battel: and there was a parcell of ground full of barley, and the people fled before the Philistims. 
\v 14 And they stood in the middes of the field, and saued it, and slewe the Philistims: so the Lord gaue a great victorie. 
\v 15 And three of the thirtie captaines went to a rocke to Dauid, into the caue of Adullam. And the armie of the Philistims camped in the valley of Rephaim. 
\v 16 And when Dauid was in the hold, the Philistims garison was at Beth-lehem. 
\v 17 And Dauid longed, and said, Oh, that one would giue me to drinke of the water of the well of Beth-lehem that is at the gate. 
\v 18 Then these three brake thorowe the hoste of the Philistims, and drewe water out of the well of Beth-lehem that was by the gate, and tooke it and brought it to Dauid: but Dauid would not drinke of it, but powred it for an oblation to the Lord, 
\v 19 And said, Let not my God suffer me to do this: should I drinke the blood of these mens liues? for they haue brought it with the ieopardie of their liues: therefore he would not drinke it: these things did these three mightie men. 
\v 20 And Abishai the brother of Ioab, he was chiefe of the three, and he lift vp his speare against three hundreth, and slew them, and had the name among the three. 
\v 21 Among the three he was more honourable then the two, and he was their captaine: but he attained not vnto the first three. 
\v 22 Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada (the sonne of a valiant man) which had done many actes, and was of Kabzeel, he slewe two strong men of Moab: he went downe also and slewe a lion in the middes of a pit in time of snowe. 
\v 23 And he slewe an Egyptian, a man of great stature, euen fiue cubites long, and in the Egyptians hand was a speare like a weauers beame: and he went downe to him with a staffe, and plucked the speare out of the Egyptians hand, and slewe him with his owne speare. 
\v 24 These things did Benaiah ye sonne of Iehoiada, and had the name among the three worthies. 
\v 25 Behold, he was honourable among thirtie, but he attained not vnto the first three. And Dauid made him of his counsell. 
\v 26 These also were valiant men of warre, Asahel the brother of Ioab, Elhanan the sonne of Dodo of Beth-lehem, 
\v 27 Shammoth the Harodite, Helez the Pelonite, 
\v 28 Ira the sonne of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Antothite, 
\v 29 Sibbecai the Husathite, Ilai the Ahohite, 
\v 30 Maharai the Netophathite, Heled ye sonne of Baanah the Netophathite, 
\v 31 Ithai the sonne of Ribai of Gibeah of the children of Beniamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite, 
\v 32 Hurai of the riuers of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite, 
\v 33 Azmaueth the Baharumite, Elihaba the Shaalbonite, 
\v 34 The sonnes of Hashem the Gizonite, Ionathan the sonne of Shageh the Harite, 
\v 35 Ahiam the sonne of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the sonne of Vr, 
\v 36 Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahiiah the Pelonite, 
\v 37 Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the sonne of Ezbai, 
\v 38 Ioel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the sonne of Haggeri, 
\v 39 Zelek the Ammonite, Nahrai the Berothite, the armour bearer of Ioab, the sonne of Zeruiah, 
\v 40 Ira the Ithrite, Garib the Ithrite, 
\v 41 Vriah the Hittite, Zabad the sonne of Ahlai, 
\v 42 Adina the sonne of Shiza the Reubenite, a captaine of the Reubenites, and thirtie with him, 
\v 43 Hanan the sonne of Maachah, and Ioshaphat the Mithnite, 
\v 44 Vzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Ieiel the sonnes of Otham the Aroerite, 
\v 45 Iediael the sonne of Shimri, and Ioha his brother the Tizite, 
\v 46 Eliel the Mahauite, and Ieribai and Ioshauiah the sonnes of Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite, 
\v 47 Eliel and Obed, and Iaasiel the Mesobaite. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 These also are they that came to Dauid to Ziklag, while he was yet kept close, because of Saul the sonne of Kish: and they were among the valiant and helpers of the battel. 
\v 2 They were weaponed with bowes, and could vse the right and the left hand with stones and with arrowes and with bowes, and were of Sauls brethren, euen of Beniamin. 
\v 3 The chiefe were Ahiezer, and Ioash the sonnes of Shemaah a Gibeathite, and Ieziel, and Pelet the sonnes of Asinaueth, Berachah and Iehu the Antothite, 
\v 4 And Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a valiant man among thirtie, and aboue the thirtie, and Ieremiah, and Iehaziel, and Iohanan, and Ioshabad the Gederathite, 
\v 5 Eluzai, and Ierimoth, and Bealiah, and Shemariah, and Shephatiah the Haruphite, 
\v 6 Elkanah, and Ishiah, and Azariel, and Ioezer, Iashobeam of Hakorehim, 
\v 7 And Ioelah, and Zebadiah, the sonnes of Ieroham of Gedor, 
\v 8 And of the Gadites there separated them selues some vnto Dauid into the holde of the wildernesse, valiant men of warre, and men of armes, and apt for battel, which coulde handle speare and shielde, and their faces were like the faces of lyons, and were like the roes in the mountaines in swiftnesse, 
\v 9 Ezer the chiefe, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third, 
\v 10 Mishmanah the fourth, Ieremiah the fift, 
\v 11 Attai the sixt, Eliel the seuenth, 
\v 12 Iohanan the eight, Elzabad the ninth, 
\v 13 Ieremiah the tenth, Macbannai the eleuenth. 
\v 14 These were the sonnes of Gad, captaines of the hoste: one of the least could resist an hundreth, and the greatest a thousand. 
\v 15 These are they that went ouer Iorden in the first moneth when he had filled ouer all his bankes, and put to flight all them of the valley, toward the East and the West. 
\v 16 And there came of the children of Beniamin, and Iudah to the hold vnto Dauid, 
\v 17 And Dauid went out to meete them, and answered and sayde vnto them, If yee be come peaceably vnto me to helpe me, mine heart shall be knit vnto you, but if you come to betray me to mine aduersaries, seeing there is no wickednes in mine handes, the God of our fathers beholde it, and rebuke it. 
\v 18 And the spirit came vpon Amasai, which was the chiefe of thirtie, and he said, Thine are we, Dauid, and with thee, O sonne of Ishai. Peace, peace be vnto thee, and peace be vnto thine helpers: for thy God helpeth thee. Then Dauid receiued them, and made them captaines of the garison. 
\v 19 And of Manasseh some fell to Dauid, when he came with the Philistims against Saul to battell, but they helped them not: for the Princes of the Philistims by aduisement sent him away, saying, He will fall to his master Saul for our heads. 
\v 20 As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Iozabad, and Iediael, and Michael, and Iozabad, and Elihu, and Ziltai, heads of the thousands that were of Manasseh. 
\v 21 And they helped Dauid against that bad: for they were all valiant men and were captaines in the hoste. 
\v 22 For at that time day by day there came to Dauid to helpe him, vntill it was a great hoste, like the hoste of God. 
\v 23 And these are the nombers of the captaines that were armed to battell, and came to Dauid to Hebron to turne the kingdome of Saul to him, according to the worde of the Lord. 
\v 24 The children of Iudah that bare shield and speare, were sixe thousand and eight hundreth armed to the warre. 
\v 25 Of the children of Simeon valiant men of warre, seuen thousand and an hundreth. 
\v 26 Of the children of Leui foure thousande and sixe hundreth. 
\v 27 And Iehoiada was the chiefe of them of Aaron: and with him three thousande and seuen hundreth. 
\v 28 And Zadok a yong man very valiant, and of his fathers housholde came two and twentie captaines. 
\v 29 And of the children of Beniamin the brethren of Saul three thousande: for a great part of them vnto that time kept the warde of the house of Saul. 
\v 30 And of the children of Ephraim twentie thousande, and eight hundreth valiant men and famous men in the housholde of their fathers. 
\v 31 And of the halfe tribe of Manasseh eighteene thousand, which were appointed by name to come and make Dauid King. 
\v 32 And of the children of Issachar which were men that had vnderstanding of the times, to knowe what Israel ought to doe: the heades of them were two hundreth, and all their brethren were at their commandement. 
\v 33 Of Zebulun that went out to battel, expert in warre, and in all instruments of warre, fiftie thousande which could set the battell in aray: they were not of a double heart. 
\v 34 And of Naphtali a thousand captaines, and with them with shielde and speare seuen and thirtie thousande. 
\v 35 And of Dan expert in battell, eyght and twentie thousande, and sixe hundreth. 
\v 36 And of Asher that went out to the battell and were trained in the warres, fourtie thousand. 
\v 37 And of the other side of Iorden of the Reubenites, and of the Gadites, and of the halfe tribe of Manasseh with all instruments of warre to fight with, an hundreth and twentie thousand. 
\v 38 All these men of warre that coulde leade an armie, came with vpright heart to Hebron to make Dauid King ouer all Israel: and all the rest of Israel was of one accorde to make Dauid King: 
\v 39 And there they were with Dauid three dayes, eating and drinking: for their brethren had prepared for them. 
\v 40 Moreouer they that were neere them vntill Issachar, and Zebulun, and Naphtali brought bread vpon asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, euen meate, floure, figges, and reisins, and wine and oyle, and beeues and sheepe abundantly: for there was ioy in Israel. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 And Dauid counselled with the captaines of thousandes and of hundreths, and with all the gouernours. 
\v 2 And Dauid said to all the Congregation of Israel, If it seeme good to you, and that it proceedeth of the Lord our God, we will sende to and from vnto our brethren, that are left in all the lande of Israel (for with them are the Priests and the Leuites in the cities and their suburbes) that they may assemble them selues vnto vs. 
\v 3 And we will bring againe the Arke of our God to vs: for we sought not vnto it in the dayes of Saul. 
\v 4 And all the Congregation answered, Let vs doe so: for the thing seemed good in the eyes of all the people. 
\v 5 So Dauid gathered all Israel together from Shihor in Egypt, euen vnto the entring of Hamath, to bring the Arke of God from Kiriath-iearim. 
\v 6 And Dauid went vp and all Israel to Baalath, in Kiriath-iearim, that was in Iudah, to bring vp from thence the Arke of God the Lord that dwelleth betweene the Cherubims, where his Name is called on. 
\v 7 And they caryed the Arke of God in a newe cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Vzza and Ahio guided the cart. 
\v 8 And Dauid and all Israel played before God with all their might, both with songes and with harpes, and with violes, and with timbrels and with cymbales and with trumpets. 
\v 9 And when they came vnto the thresshing floore of Chidon, Vzza put forth his hand to holde the Arke, for the oxen did shake it. 
\v 10 But the wrath of the Lord was kindled against Vzza, and he smote him, because he layed his hande vpon the Arke: so he dyed there before God. 
\v 11 And Dauid was angrie, because the Lord had made a breach in Vzza, and he called the name of that place Perez-vzza vnto this day. 
\v 12 And Dauid feared God that day, saying, Howe shall I bring in to me the Arke of God? 
\v 13 Therefore Dauid brought not the Arke to him into the citie of Dauid, but caused it to turne into the house of Obed Edom the Gittite. 
\v 14 So the Arke of God remained in the house of Obed Edom, euen in his house three moneths: and the Lord blessed the house of Obed Edom, and all that he had. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1 Then sent Hiram the King of Tyrus messengers to Dauid, and cedar trees, with masons and carpenters to builde him an house. 
\v 2 Therefore Dauid knewe that the Lord had confirmed him King ouer Israel, and that his kingdome was lift vp on hie, because of his people Israel. 
\v 3 Also Dauid tooke moe wiues at Ierusalem, and Dauid begate moe sonnes and daughters. 
\v 4 And these are the names of the children which he had at Ierusalem, Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Salomon, 
\v 5 And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet, 
\v 6 And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Iaphia, 
\v 7 And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet. 
\v 8 But when the Philistims heard that Dauid was anointed King ouer Israel, all the Philistims came vp to seeke Dauid. And when Dauid heard, he went out against them. 
\v 9 And the Philistims came, and spred them selues in the valley of Rephaim. 
\v 10 Then Dauid asked counsel at God, saying, Shall I goe vp against the Philistims, and wilt thou deliuer them into mine hande? And the Lord saide vnto him, Goe vp: for I will deliuer them into thine hande. 
\v 11 So they came vp to Baal-perazim, and Dauid smote them there: and Dauid said, God hath deuided mine enemies with mine hande, as waters are deuided: therefore they called the name of that place, Baal-perazim. 
\v 12 And there they had left their gods: and Dauid said, Let them euen be burnt with fire. 
\v 13 Againe the Philistims came and spread them selues in the valley. 
\v 14 And when Dauid asked againe counsell at God, God said to him, Thou shalt not goe vp after them, but turne away from them, that thou mayest come vpon them ouer against the mulberie trees. 
\v 15 And when thou hearest the noyse of one going in the toppes of the mulberie trees, then goe out to battel: for God is gone foorth before thee, to smite the hoste of the Philistims. 
\v 16 So Dauid did as God had commanded him: and they smote the hoste of the Philistims from Gibeon euen to Gezer. 
\v 17 And the fame of Dauid went out into all landes, and the Lord brought the feare of him vpon all nations. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1 And Dauid made him houses in the citie of Dauid, and prepared a place for the Arke of God, and pitched for it a tent. 
\v 2 Then Dauid saide, None ought to carie the Arke of God, but the Leuites: for the Lord hath chosen them to beare the Arke of the Lord, and to minister vnto him for euer. 
\v 3 And Dauid gathered all Israel together to Ierusalem to bring vp the Arke of the Lord vnto his place, which he had ordeined for it. 
\v 4 And Dauid assembled the sonnes of Aaron, and the Leuites. 
\v 5 Of the sonnes of Kohath, Vriel the chiefe, and his brethren sixe score. 
\v 6 Of the sonnes of Merari, Asaiah the chiefe, and his brethren two hundreth and twentie. 
\v 7 Of the sonnes of Gershom, Ioel the chiefe, and his brethren an hundreth and thirtie. 
\v 8 Of the sonnes of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chiefe, and his brethren two hundreth. 
\v 9 Of the sonnes of Hebron, Eliel the chiefe, and his brethren fourescore. 
\v 10 Of the sonnes of Vzziel, Amminadab the chiefe, and his brethren an hundreth and twelue. 
\v 11 And Dauid called Zadok and Abiathar the Priestes, and of the Leuites, Vriel, Asaiah and Ioel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab: 
\v 12 And he saide vnto them, Ye are the chiefe fathers of the Leuites: sanctifie your selues, and your brethren, and bring vp the Arke of the Lord God of Israel vnto the place that I haue prepared for it. 
\v 13 For because ye were not there at the first, the Lord our God made a breach among vs: for we sought him not after due order. 
\v 14 So the Priestes and the Leuites sanctified them selues to bring vp the Arke of the Lord God of Israel. 
\v 15 And the sonnes of the Leuites bare the Arke of God vpon their shoulders with the barres, as Moses had commanded, according to the worde of the Lord. 
\v 16 And Dauid spake to the chiefe of the Leuites, that they should appoint certaine of their brethren to sing with instruments of musike, with violes and harpes, and cymbales, that they might make a sounde, and lift vp their voyce with ioye. 
\v 17 So the Leuites appointed Heman the sonne of Ioel, and of his brethren Asaph the sonne of Berechiah, and of the sonnes of Merari their brethren, Ethan the sonne of Kushaiah, 
\v 18 And with them their brethren in the seconde degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Iaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Iehiel, and Vnni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneah, and Obed Edom, and Ieiel the porters. 
\v 19 So Heman, Asaph and Ethan were fingers to make a sounde with cymbales of brasse, 
\v 20 And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Iehiel, and Vnni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah with violes on Alamoth, 
\v 21 And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneah, and Obed Edom, and Ieiel, and Azaziah, with harpes vpon Sheminith Ienazzeah. 
\v 22 But Chenaniah the chiefe of the Leuites had the charge, bearing ye burden in the charge, for he was able to instruct. 
\v 23 And Berechiah and Elkanah were porters for the Arke. 
\v 24 And Shecaniah and Iehoshaphat and Nethaneel and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer the Priestes did blowe with trumpets before the Arke of God, and Obed Edom and Ieiiah were porters for the Arke. 
\v 25 So Dauid and the Elders of Israel and the captaines of thousandes went to bring vp the Arke of the couenant of the Lord from the house of Obed Edom with ioye. 
\v 26 And because that God helped the Leuites that bare the Arke of the couenant of the Lord, they offered seuen bullockes and seuen rammes. 
\v 27 And Dauid had on him a linen garment, as all the Leuites that bare the Arke, and the singers and Chenaniah that had the chiefe charge of the singers: and vpon Dauid was a linnen Ephod. 
\v 28 Thus all Israel brought vp the Arke of the Lordes couenant with shouting and sounde of cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbales, making a sound with violes and with harpes. 
\v 29 And when the Arke of the couenant of the Lord came into the citie of Dauid, Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at a windowe, and sawe King Dauid dauncing and playing, and she despised him in her heart. 
\c 16  
\p
\v 1 So they brought in the Arke of God, and set it in the middes of the Tabernacle that Dauid had pitched for it, and they offred burnt offrings and peace offrings before God. 
\v 2 And when Dauid had made an ende of offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings, hee blessed the people in the Name of the Lord. 
\v 3 And he dealt to euery one of Israel both man and woman, to euery one a cake of breade, and a piece of flesh, and a bottel of wine. 
\v 4 And he appointed certaine of the Leuites to minister before the Arke of the Lord, and to rehearse and to thanke and prayse the Lord God of Israel: 
\v 5 Asaph the chiefe, and next to him Zechariah, Ieiel, and Shemiramoth, and Iehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed Edom, euen Ieiel with instruments, violes and harpes, and Asaph to make a sound with cymbales, 
\v 6 And Benaiah and Iahaziel Priestes, with trumpets continually before the Arke of the couenant of God. 
\v 7 Then at that time Dauid did appoint at the beginning to giue thankes to the Lord by the hand of Asaph and his brethren. 
\v 8 Praise the Lord and call vpon his Name: declare his workes among the people. 
\v 9 Sing vnto him, sing praise vnto him, and talke of all his wonderfull workes. 
\v 10 Reioyce in his holy Name: let the hearts of them that seeke the Lord reioyce. 
\v 11 Seeke the Lord and his strength: seeke his face continually. 
\v 12 Remember his marueilous workes that he hath done, his wonders, and the iudgements of his mouth, 
\v 13 O seede of Israel his seruant, O the children of Iaakob his chosen. 
\v 14 He is the Lord our God: his iudgements are throughout all the earth. 
\v 15 Remember his couenant for euer, and the worde, which hee commanded to a thousand generations: 
\v 16 Which he made with Abraham, and his othe to Izhak: 
\v 17 And hath confirmed it to Iaakob for a Law, and to Israel for an euerlasting couenant, 
\v 18 Saying, To thee will I giue the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance. 
\v 19 When ye were fewe in number, yea, a very fewe, and strangers therein, 
\v 20 And walked about from nation to nation, and from one kingdome to another people, 
\v 21 He suffered no man to do them wrong, but rebuked Kings for their sakes, saying, 
\v 22 Touch not mine anoynted, and doe my Prophets no harme. 
\v 23 Sing vnto the Lord all the earth: declare his saluation from day to day. 
\v 24 Declare his glory among the nations, and his wonderful workes among all people. 
\v 25 For the Lord is great and much to be praised, and hee is to bee feared aboue all gods. 
\v 26 For all the gods of the people are idoles, but the Lord made the heauens. 
\v 27 Prayse and glory are before him: power and beautie are in his place. 
\v 28 Giue vnto the Lord, ye families of the people: giue vnto the Lord glory and power. 
\v 29 Giue vnto the Lord ye glory of his Name: bring an offring and come before him, and worship the Lord in the glorious Sanctuarie. 
\v 30 Tremble ye before him, al the earth: surely the world shalbe stable and not moue. 
\v 31 Let the heauens reioyce, and let the earth be glad, and let them say among the nations, The Lord reigneth. 
\v 32 Let the sea roare, and all that therein is: Let the field be ioyfull and all that is in it. 
\v 33 Let the trees of the wood then reioyce at the presence of the Lord: for he commeth to iudge the earth. 
\v 34 Prayse the Lord, for hee is good, for his mercie endureth for euer. 
\v 35 And say ye, Saue vs, O God, our saluation, and gather vs, and deliuer vs from the heathen, that we may prayse thine holy Name, and glorie in thy praise. 
\v 36 Blessed be the Lord God of Israel for euer and euer: and let all people say, So be it, and praise the Lord. 
\v 37 Then he left there before the Arke of the Lordes couenant Asaph and his brethren to minister continually before the Arke, that which was to be done euery day: 
\v 38 And Obed Edom and his brethren, three score and eight: and Obed Edom the sonne of Ieduthun, and Hosah were porters. 
\v 39 And Zadok the Priest and his brethren the Priestes were before the Tabernacle of ye Lord, in the hie place that was at Gibeon, 
\v 40 To offer burnt offrings vnto the Lord, vpon the burnt offring altar continually, in the morning and in the euening, euen according vnto all that is written in the law of the Lord, which hee commanded Israel. 
\v 41 And with them were Heman, and Ieduthun, and the rest that were chosen (which were appointed by names) to praise the Lord, because his mercie endureth for euer. 
\v 42 Euen with them were Heman and Ioduthun, to make a sound with the cornets and with the cymbales, with excellent instruments of musicke: and the sonnes of Ieduthun were at the gate. 
\v 43 And all the people departed, euerie man to his house: and Dauid returned to blesse his house. 
\c 17  
\p
\v 1 Nowe afterward when Dauid dwelt in his house, he saide to Nathan the Prophet, Beholde, I dwell in an house of cedar trees, but the Arke of the Lordes couenant remaineth vnder curtaines. 
\v 2 Then Nathan said to Dauid, Do all that is in thine heart: for God is with thee. 
\v 3 And the same night euen the word of God came to Nathan, saying, 
\v 4 Goe, and tell Dauid my seruant, Thus saith the Lord, Thou shalt not buylde me an house to dwell in: 
\v 5 For I haue dwelt in no house, since the day that I brought out the childre of Israel vnto this daye, but I haue bene from tent to tent, and from habitation to habitation. 
\v 6 Wheresoeuer I haue walked with all Israel spake I one word to any of the iudges of Israel (whome I commanded to feede my people) saying, Why haue ye not built mee an house of cedar trees? 
\v 7 Nowe therefore thus shalt thou say vnto my seruant Dauid, Thus saith the Lord of hostes, I tooke thee from the sheepecoat and from following the sheepe, that thou shouldest bee a prince ouer my people Israel. 
\v 8 And I haue bene with thee whithersoeuer thou hast walked, and haue destroyed all thine enemies out of thy sight, and haue made thee a name, like the name of the great men that are in the earth. 
\v 9 (Also I will appoynt a place for my people Israel, and will plant it, that they may dwell in their place, and moue no more: neither shall the wicked people vexe them any more, as at the beginning, 
\v 10 And since the time that I commanded iudges ouer my people Israel) And I wil subdue all thine enemies: therefore I say vnto thee, that the Lord wil buylde thee an house. 
\v 11 And when thy dayes shalbe fulfilled to go with thy fathers, then will I rayse vp thy seede after thee, which shalbe of thy sonnes, and will stablish his kingdome. 
\v 12 He shall builde me an house, and I will stablish his throne for euer. 
\v 13 I wil be his father, and he shalbe my sonne, aud I will not take my mercie away from him, as I tooke it from him that was before thee. 
\v 14 But I wil establish him in mine house, and in my kingdome for euer, and his throne shalbe stablished for euer, 
\v 15 According to all these wordes, and according to al this vision. So Nathan spake to Dauid. 
\v 16 And Dauid the King went in and sate before the Lord and said, Who am I, O Lord God, and what is mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto? 
\v 17 Yet thou esteeming this a small thing, O God, hast also spoken concerning the house of thy seruaut for a great while, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of hie degree, O Lord God. 
\v 18 What can Dauid desire more of thee for the honour of thy seruant? for thou knowest thy seruant. 
\v 19 O Lord, for thy seruantes sake, euen according to thine heart hast thou done all this great thing to declare all magnificence. 
\v 20 Lord, there is none like thee, neither is there any God besides thee, according to all that we haue heard with our eares. 
\v 21 Moreouer what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whose God went to redeeme them to be his people, and to make thy selfe a Name, and to doe great and terrible things by casting out nations from before thy people, whom thou hast deliuered out of Egypt? 
\v 22 For thou hast ordeined thy people Israel to be thine owne people for euer, and thou Lord art become their God. 
\v 23 Therefore nowe Lord, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy seruant and concerning his house, be confirmed for euer, and doe as thou hast sayd, 
\v 24 And let thy name be stable and magnified for euer, that it may be sayd, The Lord of hostes, God of Israel, is the God of Israel, and let the house of Dauid thy seruant bee stablished before thee. 
\v 25 For thou, O my God, hast reueiled vnto the eare of thy seruant, that thou wilt builde him an house: therefore thy seruant hath bene bolde to pray before thee. 
\v 26 Therefore nowe Lord (for thou art God, and hast spoken this goodnesse vnto thy seruant) 
\v 27 Now therfore, it hath pleased thee to blesse the house of thy seruant, that it may bee before thee for euer: for thou, O Lord, hast blessed it, and it shalbe blessed for euer. 
\c 18  
\p
\v 1 And after this Dauid smote the Philistims, and subdued them, and tooke Gath, and the villages thereof out of the hand of the Philistims. 
\v 2 And he smote Moab, and the Moabites became Dauids seruants, and brought giftes. 
\v 3 And Dauid smote Hadarezer King of Zobah vnto Hamath, as he went to stablish his border by the riuer Perath. 
\v 4 And Dauid tooke from him a thousand charets, and seuen thousand horsemen, and twentie thousand footemen, and destroyed all the charets, but he reserued of them an hundreth charets. 
\v 5 Then came the Aramites of Damascus to succour Hadarezer King of Zobah, but Dauid slewe of the Aramites two and twentie thousand. 
\v 6 And Dauid put a garison in Aram of Damascus, and the Aramites became Dauids seruants, and brought giftes: and the Lord preserued Dauid wheresoeuer he went. 
\v 7 And Dauid tooke the shieldes of gold that were of the seruants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Ierusalem. 
\v 8 And from Tibhath, and from Chun (cities of Hadarezer) brought Dauid exceeding much brasse, wherewith Salomon made the brasen Sea, and the pillars and the vessels of brasse. 
\v 9 Then Tou King of Hamath heard howe Dauid had smitten all the hoste of Hadarezer King of Zobah: 
\v 10 Therefore he sent Hadoram his sonne to King Dauid, to salute him, and to reioyce with him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and beaten him (for Tou had warre with Hadarezer) who brought all vessels of golde and siluer and brasse. 
\v 11 And King Dauid did dedicate them vnto the Lord, with the siluer and golde that hee brought from all the nations, from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistims, and from Amalek. 
\v 12 And Abishai the sonne of Zeruiah smote of Edom in the salt valley eighteene thousand, 
\v 13 And he put a garison in Edom, and all the Edomites became Dauids seruantes: and the Lord preserued Dauid wheresoeuer he went. 
\v 14 So Dauid reigned ouer all Israel, and executed iudgement and iustice to all his people. 
\v 15 And Ioab the sonne of Zeruiah was ouer the hoste, and Iehoshaphat the sonne of Ahilud recorder, 
\v 16 And Zadok the sonne of Ahitub, and Abimelech the sonne of Abiathar were the Priests, and Shausha the Scribe, 
\v 17 And Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada was ouer the Cherethites and the Pelethites: and the sonnes of Dauid were chiefe about the King. 
\c 19  
\p
\v 1 After this also Nahash the King of the children of Ammon dyed, and his sonne reigned in his stead. 
\v 2 And Dauid said, I will shew kindnesse vnto Hanun the sonne of Nahash, because his father shewed kindnesse vnto me. And Dauid sent messengers to comfort him for his father. So the seruants of Dauid came into the lande of the children of Ammon to Hanun to comfort him. 
\v 3 And the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that Dauid doeth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters vnto thee? Are not his seruants come to thee to search, to seeke and to spie out the land? 
\v 4 Wherefore Hanun tooke Dauids seruants, and shaued them, and cut off their garments by the halfe vnto the buttocks, and sent them away. 
\v 5 And there went certaine and tolde Dauid concerning the men: and he sent to meete them (for the men were exceedingly ashamed) and the King saide, Tarie at Iericho, vntill your beardes be growen: then returne. 
\v 6 When the children of Ammon saw that they stanke in the sight of Dauid, then sent Hanun and the children of Ammon a thousande talents of siluer to hire them charets and horsemen out of Aram Naharaim and out of Aram Maachah, and out of Zobah. 
\v 7 And they hired them two and thirty thousande charets, and the King of Maachah and his people, which came and pitched before Medeba: and the children of Ammon gathered themselues together from their cities, and came to the battell. 
\v 8 And when Dauid heard, he sent Ioab and all the hoste of the valiant men. 
\v 9 And the children of Ammon came out, and set their battell in aray at the gate of the citie. And the Kings that were come, were by them selues in the fielde. 
\v 10 When Ioab saw that the front of the battel was against him before and behinde, then he chose out of all the choyse of Israel, and set him selfe in aray to meete the Aramites. 
\v 11 And the rest of the people he deliuered vnto the hande of Abishai his brother, and they put them selues in aray against the children of Ammon. 
\v 12 And he saide, If Aram be too strong for me, then thou shalt succour me: and if the children of Ammon preuaile against thee, then I wil succour thee. 
\v 13 Be strong, and let vs shewe our selues valiant for our people, and for the cities of our God, and let the Lord doe that which is good in his owne sight. 
\v 14 So Ioab and the people that was with him, came neere before the Aramites vnto the battel, and they fled before him. 
\v 15 And when the children of Ammon sawe that the Aramites fled, they fled also before Abishai his brother, and entred into the citie: so Ioab came to Ierusalem. 
\v 16 And when the Aramites sawe that they were discomfited before Israel, they sent messengers and caused the Aramites to come forth that were beyond the riuer: and Shophach the captaine of the hoste of Hadarezer went before them. 
\v 17 And when it was shewed Dauid, he gathered all Israel, and went ouer Iorden, and came vnto them, and put him selfe in aray against them: And when Dauid had put him selfe in battel aray to meete the Aramites, they fought with him. 
\v 18 But the Aramites fled before Israel, and Dauid destroyed of the Aramites seuen thousand charets, and fourtie thousand footemen, and killed Shophach the captaine of the hoste. 
\v 19 And when the seruants of Hadarezer sawe that they fell before Israel, they made peace with Dauid, and serued him. And the Aramites would no more succour the children of Ammon. 
\c 20  
\p
\v 1 And when the yere was expired, in the time that Kings goe out a warfare, Ioab caryed out the strength of the armie, and destroyed the countrey of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah (but Dauid taryed at Ierusalem) and Ioab smote Rabbah and destroyed it. 
\v 2 Then Dauid tooke the crowne of their King from off his head, and founde it the weight of a talent of golde, with precious stones in it: and it was set on Dauids head, and he brought away the spoyle of the citie exceeding much. 
\v 3 And he caryed away the people that were in it, and cut them with sawes, and with harowes of yron, and with axes: euen thus did Dauid with all the cities of the children of Ammon. Then Dauid and all the people came againe to Ierusalem. 
\v 4 And after this also there arose warre at Gezer with the Philistims: then Sibbechai the Hushathite slewe Sippai, of the children of Haraphah, and they were subdued. 
\v 5 And there was yet another battell with the Philistims: and Elhanan the sonne of Iair slewe Lahmi, the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spearestaffe was like a weauers beame. 
\v 6 And yet againe there was a battel at Gath, where was a man of a great stature, and his fingers were by sixes, euen foure and twentie, and was also the sonne of Haraphah. 
\v 7 And when he reuiled Israel, Iehonathan the sonne of Shimea Dauids brother did slay him. 
\v 8 These were borne vnto Haraphah at Gath, and fell by the hand of Dauid: and by the hands of his seruants. 
\c 21  
\p
\v 1 And Satan stoode vp against Israel, and prouoked Dauid to nomber Israel. 
\v 2 Therefore Dauid said to Ioab, and to the rulers of the people, Go, and nomber Israel from Beer-sheba euen to Dan, and bring it to me, that I may knowe the nomber of them. 
\v 3 And Ioab answered, The Lord increase his people an hundreth times so many as they be, O my lord the King: are they not all my lords seruats? wherefore doeth my lord require this thing? why should he be a cause of trespasse to Israel? 
\v 4 Neuerthelesse the Kings word preuailed against Ioab. And Ioab departed and went thorowe all Israel, and returned to Ierusalem. 
\v 5 And Ioab gaue the nomber and summe of the people vnto Dauid: and all Israel were eleuen hundreth thousande men that drewe sword: and Iudah was foure hundreth and seuentie thousande men that drewe sword. 
\v 6 But the Leuites and Beniamin counted he not among them: for the Kings worde was abominable to Ioab. 
\v 7 And God was displeased with this thing: therefore he smote Israel. 
\v 8 Then Dauid saide vnto God, I haue sinned greatly, because I haue done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, remooue the iniquitie of thy seruant: for I haue done very foolishly. 
\v 9 And the Lord spake vnto Gad Dauids Seer, saying, 
\v 10 Goe and tell Dauid, saying, Thus saith the Lord, I offer thee three thinges: choose thee one of them, that I may doe it vnto thee. 
\v 11 So Gad came to Dauid, and sayde vnto him, Thus saith the Lord, Take to thee 
\v 12 Either three yeeres famine, or three moneths to be destroyed before thine aduersaries, and the sworde of thine enemies to take thee, or els the sworde of the Lord and pestilence in the lande three dayes, that the Angel of the Lord may destroy throughout all the coastes of Israel: nowe therefore aduise thee, what word I shall bring againe to him that sent me. 
\v 13 And Dauid said vnto Gad, I am in a wonderfull strait. let me nowe fall into the hande of the Lord: for his mercies are exceeding great, and let me not fall into the hande of man. 
\v 14 So the Lord sent a pestilence in Israel, and there fell of Israel seuentie thousande men. 
\v 15 And God sent the Angel into Ierusalem to destroy it. And as he was destroying, the Lord behelde, and repented of the euill and sayde to the Angel that destroyed, It is nowe ynough, let thine hande cease. Then the Angel of the Lord stoode by the thresshing floore of Ornan the Iebusite. 
\v 16 And Dauid lift vp his eyes, and sawe the Angel of the Lord stande betweene the earth and the heauen with his sworde drawen in his hand, and stretched out towarde Ierusalem. Then Dauid and the Elders of Israel, which were clothed in sacke, fell vpon their faces. 
\v 17 And Dauid said vnto God, Is it not I that commanded to nomber the people? It is euen I that haue sinned and haue committed euil, but these sheepe what haue they done? O Lord my God, I beseech thee, let thine hande be on me and on my fathers house, and not on thy people for their destruction. 
\v 18 Then the Angel of the Lord commanded Gad to say to Dauid, that Dauid should goe vp, and set vp an altar vnto the Lord in the thresshing floore of Ornan the Iebusite. 
\v 19 So Dauid went vp according to the saying of Gad, which he had spoken in the Name of the Lord. 
\v 20 And Ornan turned about, and sawe the Angel, and his foure sonnes, that were with him, hid them selues, and Ornan thresshed wheat. 
\v 21 And as Dauid came to Ornan, Ornan looked and sawe Dauid, and went out of the thresshing floore, and bowed himselfe to Dauid with his face to the grounde. 
\v 22 And Dauid saide to Ornan, Giue me the place of thy thresshing floore, that I may builde an altar therein vnto the Lord: giue it me for sufficient money, that the plague may be stayed from the people. 
\v 23 Then Ornan saide vnto Dauid, Take it to thee, and let my lord the King do that which seemeth him good: loe, I giue thee bullockes for burnt offrings, and thresshing instruments for wood, and wheat for meate offring, I giue it all. 
\v 24 And King Dauid saide to Ornan, Not so: but I will bye it for sufficient money: for I wil not take that which is thine for the Lord, nor offer burnt offrings without cost. 
\v 25 So Dauid gaue to Ornan for that place sixe hundreth shekels of golde by weight. 
\v 26 And Dauid built there an altar vnto the Lord, and offred burnt offrings, and peace offrings, and called vpon the Lord, and he answered him by fire from heauen vpon the altar of burnt offring. 
\v 27 And when the Lord had spoken to the Angel, he put vp his sworde againe into his sheath. 
\v 28 At that time when Dauid sawe that the Lord had heard him in the thresshing floore of Ornan the Iebusite, then he sacrificed there. 
\v 29 (But the Tabernacle of the Lord which Moses had made in the wildernesse, and the altar of burnt offring were at that season in the hie place at Gibeon. 
\v 30 And Dauid could not go before it to aske counsel at God: for he was afraide of the sworde of the Angel of the Lord.) 
\c 22  
\p
\v 1 And Dauid saide, This is the house of the Lord God, and this is the altar for the burnt offring of Israel. 
\v 2 And Dauid commanded to gather together the strangers that were in the lande of Israel, and he set masons to hewe and polish stones to builde the house of God. 
\v 3 Dauid also prepared much yron for the nayles of the doores and of the gates, and for the ioynings, and abundance of brasse passing weight, 
\v 4 And cedar trees without nomber: for the Zidonians and they of Tyrus brought much cedar wood to Dauid. 
\v 5 And Dauid saide, Salomon my sonne is yong and tender, and we must builde an house for the Lord, magnificall, excellent and of great fame and dignitie throughout all countreyes. I will therefore nowe prepare for him. So Dauid prepared very much before his death. 
\v 6 Then he called Salomon his sonne, and charged him to builde an house for the Lord God of Israel. 
\v 7 And Dauid said to Salomon, My sonne, I purposed with my selfe to builde an house to the Name of the Lord my God, 
\v 8 But the worde of the Lord came to me, saying, Thou hast shed much blood, and hast made great battels: thou shalt not builde an house vnto my Name: for thou hast shead much blood vpon the earth in my sight. 
\v 9 Beholde, a sonne is borne to thee, which shalbe a man of rest, for I will giue him rest from all his enemies rounde about: therefore his name is Salomon: and I will sende peace and quietnes vpon Israel in his dayes. 
\v 10 Hee shall builde an house for my Name, and he shalbe my sonne, and I will be his father, and I will establish the throne of his kingdome vpon Israel for euer. 
\v 11 Nowe therefore my sonne, the Lord shalbe with thee, and thou shalt prosper, and thou shalt builde an house to the Lord thy God, as he hath spoken of thee. 
\v 12 Onely the Lord giue thee wisedome and vnderstanding, and giue thee charge ouer Israel, euen to keepe the Lawe of the Lord thy God. 
\v 13 Then thou shalt prosper, if thou take heede to obserue the statutes and the iudgements which the Lord commanded Moses for Israel: be strong and of good courage: feare not, neither bee afraide. 
\v 14 For beholde, according to my pouertie haue I prepared for the house of the Lord an hundreth thousand talents of golde, and a thousand thousande talents of siluer, and of brasse and of yron passing weight: for there was abundance: I haue also prepared timber and stone, and thou mayest prouide more thereto. 
\v 15 Moreouer thou hast workmen with thee enough, hewers of stone, and workemen for timber, and all men expert in euery worke. 
\v 16 Of golde, of siluer, and of brasse, and of yron there is no nomber: Vp therefore, and be doing, and the Lord wilbe with thee. 
\v 17 Dauid also commanded all the princes of Israel to helpe Salomon his sonne, saying, 
\v 18 Is not the Lord your God with you, and hath giuen you rest on euerie side? for hee hath giuen the inhabitants of the land into mine hand, and the land is subdued before the Lord and before his people. 
\v 19 Nowe set your hearts and your soules to seeke the Lord your God, and arise, and builde the Sanctuarie of the Lord God to bring the Arke of the couenant of the Lord, and the holy vessels of God into the house built for the Name of the Lord. 
\c 23  
\p
\v 1 So when Dauid was olde and full of dayes, he made Salomon his sonne King ouer Israel. 
\v 2 And hee gathered together all the princes of Israel with the Priestes and the Leuites. 
\v 3 And the Leuites were numbred from ye age of thirtie yeere and aboue, and their nomber according to their summe was eight and thirtie thousand men. 
\v 4 Of these foure and twentie thousande were set to aduance the worke of the house of the Lord, and sixe thousand were ouerseers and iudges. 
\v 5 And foure thousand were porters, and foure thousande praised the Lord with instruments which he made to praise the Lord. 
\v 6 So Dauid deuided offices vnto them, to wit, to the sonnes of Leui, to Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 
\v 7 Of the Gershonites were Laadan and Shimei. 
\v 8 The sonnes of Laadan, the chiefe was Iehiel, and Zetham and Ioel, three. 
\v 9 The Sonnes of Shimei, Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haram, three: these were the chiefe fathers of Laadan. 
\v 10 Also the sonnes of Shimei were Iahath, Zina, Ieush, and Beriah: these foure were ye sonnes of Shimei. 
\v 11 And Iahath was the chiefe, and Zizah the seconde, but Ieush and Beriah had not many sonnes: therfore they were in the families of their father, counted but as one. 
\v 12 The sonnes of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron aud Vzziel, foure. 
\v 13 The sonnes of Amram, Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated to sanctifie the most holy place, hee and his sonnes for euer to burne incense before the Lord, to minister to him, and to blesse in his Name for euer. 
\v 14 Moses also the man of God, and his children were named with the tribe of Leui. 
\v 15 The sonnes of Moses were Gershom, and Eliezer, 
\v 16 Of the sonnes of Gershom was Shebuel the chiefe. 
\v 17 And the sonne of Eliezer was Rehabiah the chiefe: for Eliezer had none other sonnes: but the sonnes of Rehabiah were very many. 
\v 18 The sone of Izhar was Shelomith ye chiefe. 
\v 19 The sonnes of Hebron were Ieriah the first, Amariah the second, Iahaziel the third, and Iekamiam the fourth. 
\v 20 The sones of Vzziel were Michah the first, and Isshiah the second. 
\v 21 The sonnes of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. The sonnes of Mahli, Eleazar and Kish. 
\v 22 And Eleazar dyed, and had no sonnes, but daughters, and their brethren the sonnes of Kish tooke them. 
\v 23 The sonnes of Mushi were Mahli, and Eder, and Ierimoth, three. 
\v 24 These were the sonnes of Leui according to the house of their fathers, euen the chiefe fathers according to their offices, according to the nomber of names and their summe that did the worke for the seruice of the house of the Lord from the age of twentie yeeres and aboue. 
\v 25 For Dauid sayde, The Lord God of Israel hath giuen rest vnto his people, that they may dwell in Ierusalem for euer. 
\v 26 And also the Leuites shall no more beare the Tabernacle and al the vessels for the seruice thereof. 
\v 27 Therefore according to the last wordes of Dauid, the Leuites were nombred from twentie yeere and aboue, 
\v 28 And their office was vnder the hand of the sonnes of Aaron, for the seruice of the house of the Lord in the courtes, and chambers, and in the purifiyng of all holy thinges, and in the worke of the seruice of the house of God, 
\v 29 Both for the shewbread, and for the fine floure, for the meate offring, and for the vnleauened cakes, and for the fryed things, and for that which was rosted, and for all measures and cise, 
\v 30 And for to stand euery morning, to giue thanks and praise to the Lord, and likewise at euen, 
\v 31 And to offer all burnt offrings vnto the Lord, in the Sabbaths, in the moneths, and at the appointed times, according to the nomber and according to their custome continually before the Lord, 
\v 32 And that they should keepe the charge of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and the charge of ye holy place, and the charge of ye sonnes of Aaron their brethren in the seruice of ye house of the Lord. 
\c 24  
\p
\v 1 These are also the diuisions of the sonnes of Aaron: The sonnes of Aaron were Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 
\v 2 But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the Priestes office. 
\v 3 And Dauid distributed them, euen Zadok of the sonnes of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sonnes of Ithamar according to their offices in their ministration. 
\v 4 And there were found more of the sonnes of Eleazar by the number of men, then of the sonnes of Ithamar. and they deuided them, to wit, among the sonnes of Eleazar, sixteene heads, according to the houshould of their fathers, and among ye sonnes of Ithamar, according to the housholde of their fathers, eight. 
\v 5 Thus they distributed them by lot the one from the other, and so the rulers of the Sanctuarie and the rulers of the house of God were of the sonnes of Eleazar and of the sonnes of Ithamar. 
\v 6 And Shemaiah the sonne of Nethaneel the scribe of the Leuites, wrote them before ye King and the princes, and Zadok the Priest, and Ahimelech the sonne of Abiathar, and before ye chiefe fathers of the Priests and of the Leuites, one familie being reserued for Eleazar, and another reserued for Ithamar. 
\v 7 And the first lot fell to Iehoiarib, and the second to Iedaiah, 
\v 8 The third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim, 
\v 9 The fifth to Malchiiah, the sixt to Miiamin, 
\v 10 The seuenth to Hakkoz, the eight to Abiiah,

\v 14 The fiftenth to Bilgah, the sixtenth to Immer, 
\v 15 The seuententh to Hezir, the eightenth to Happizzer, 
\v 16 The ninetenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Iehezekel, 
\v 17 The one and twentie to Iachin, the two and twentie to Gamul, 
\v 18 The three and twentie to Deliah, the foure and twentie to Maaziah. 
\v 19 These were their orders according to their offices, when they entred into the house of the Lord according to their custome vnder the hande of Aaron their father, as the Lord God of Israel had commanded him. 
\v 20 And of the sonnes of Leui that remained of the sonnes of Amram, was Shubael, of the sonnes of Shubael, Iedeiah, 
\v 21 Of Rehabiah. euen of the sonnes of Rehabiah, the first Isshiiah, 
\v 22 Of Izhari, Shelomoth, of the sonnes of Shelomoth, Iahath, 
\v 23 And his sonnes Ieriah the first, Amariah the second, Iahaziel the thirde, and Iekameam the fourth, 
\v 24 The sonne of Vzziel was Michah, ye sonne of Michah was Shamir, 
\v 25 The brother of Michah was Isshiiah, the sonne of Isshiiah, Zechariah, 
\v 26 The sonnes of Merari, were Mahli and Mushi, the sonne of Iaaziiah was Beno, 
\v 27 The sonnes of Merari of Iahaziah were Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur and Ibri. 
\v 28 Of Mahli came Eleazar, which had no sonnes. 
\v 29 Of Kish. the sonne of Kish was Ierahmeel, 
\v 30 And the sonnes of Mushi were Mahli, and Eder, and Ierimoth: these were sonnes of the Leuites after the houshold of their fathers. 
\v 31 And these also cast lots with their brethren the sonnes of Aaron before King Dauid, and Zadok and Ahimelech and the chiefe fathers of the Priests, and of the Leuites, euen the chiefe of the families against their yonger brethren. 
\c 25  
\p
\v 1 So Dauid and the captaines of the armie separated for the ministerie the sonnes of Asaph, and Heman, and Ieduthun, who should sing prophesies with harpes, with violes, and with cymbales, and their nomber was euen of the men for the office of their ministerie, to wit, 
\v 2 Of the sonnes of Asaph, Zaccur, and Ioseph, and Nethaniah, and Asharelah the sonnes of Asaph were vnder the hand of Asaph, which sang prophesies by the commission of the King. 
\v 3 Of Ieduthun, the sonnes of Ieduthun, Gedaliah, and Zeri, and Ieshaiah, Ashabiah and Mattithiah, six, vnder the hands of their father: Ieduthun sang prophecies with an harpe, for to giue thankes and to praise the Lord.

\v 5 All these were the sonnes of Heman, the Kings Seer in the wordes of God to lift vp the horne: and God gaue to Heman fourtene sonnes and three daughters. 
\v 6 All these were vnder the hande of their father, singing in the house of the Lord with cymbales, violes and harpes, for the seruice of the house of God, and Asaph, and Ieduthun, and Heman were at the Kings commandement. 
\v 7 So was their nomber with their brethre that were instruct in ye songs of the Lord, euen of al that were cunning, two hundreth foure score and eight. 
\v 8 And they cast lottes, charge against charge, aswel small as great, the cunning man as the scholer. 
\v 9 And the first lot fell to Ioseph which was of Asaph, the second, to Gedaliah, who with his brethren and his sonnes were twelue.

\v 2 And King Dauid stoode vp vpon his feete; and saide, Heare ye me, my brethren and my people: I purposed to haue buylt an house of rest for the Arke of the couenant of the Lord, and for a footestoole of our God, and haue made ready for the building, 
\v 3 But God sayde vnto me, Thou shalt not buylde an house for my Name, because thou hast bene a man of warre, and hast shed blood. 
\v 4 Yet as the Lord God of Israel chose me before all the house of my father, to be King ouer Israel for euer (for in Iudah woulde he chuse a prince, and of the house of Iudah is the house of my father, and among the sonnes of my father he delited in me to make me King ouer all Israel) 
\v 5 So of all my sonnes (for the Lord hath giuen me many sonnes) he hath euen chosen Salomon my sonne to sit vpon the throne of the kingdome of the Lord ouer Israel. 
\v 6 And he sayd vnto me, Salomon thy sonne, he shall build mine house and my courtes: for I haue chosen him to be my sonne, and I will be his father. 
\v 7 I will stablish therefore his kingdome for euer, if he endeuour himselfe to do my commandements, and my iudgements, as this day. 
\v 8 Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the Congregation of the Lord, and in the audience of our God, keepe and seeke for all the commandements of the Lord your God, that ye may possesse this good lande, and leaue it for an inheritance for your children after you for euer. 
\v 9 And thou, Salomon my sonne, know thou the God of thy father, and serue him with a perfit heart, and with a willing minde: For the Lord searcheth all hearts, and vnderstandeth all the imaginations of thoughts: if thou seeke him, he will be found of thee, but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for euer. 
\v 10 Take heede now, for the Lord hath chosen thee to buylde the house of the Sanctuarie: be strong therefore, and doe it. 
\v 11 Then Dauid gaue to Salomon his sonne the paterne of the porch and of the houses thereof, and of the closets thereof, and of the galleries thereof, and of the chambers thereof that are within, and of the house of the mercieseate, 
\v 12 And the paterne of all that he had in his minde for the courtes of the house of the Lord, and for all the chambers round about, for the treasures of the house of God, and for the treasures of the dedicate things, 
\v 13 And for the courses of the Priestes, and of the Leuites, and for all the woorke for the seruice of the house of the Lord, and for all the vessels of the ministerie of the house of the Lord. 
\v 14 He gaue of golde by weight, for the vessels of gold, for all the vessels of all maner of seruice, and all the vessels of siluer by weight, for all maner vessels of all maner of seruice. 
\v 15 The weight also of golde for the candlestickes, and gold for their lampes, with the weight for euery candlesticke, and for the lampes thereof, and for the candlestickes of siluer by the weight of the candlesticke, and the lampes thereof, according to the vse of euery candlesticke, 
\v 16 And the weight of the gold for the tables of shewbread, for euery table, and siluer for the tables of siluer, 
\v 17 And pure golde for the fleshhookes, and the bowles, and plates, and for basens, golde in weight for euery basen, and for siluer basens, by weight for euery basen, 
\v 18 And for the altar of incense, pure golde by weight, and golde for the paterne of the charet of the Cherubs that spread themselues, and couered the Arke of the couenant of the Lord: 
\v 19 All, said he, by writing sent to me by the hand of the Lord, which made me vnderstand all the workemanship of the paterne. 
\v 20 And Dauid said to Salomon his sonne, Be strong, and of a valiant courage and doe it: feare not, nor be afraide: for the Lord God, euen my God is with thee: he will not leaue thee nor forsake thee till thou hast finished all the worke for the seruice of the house of the Lord. 
\v 21 Beholde also, the companies of the Priests and the Leuites for all the seruice of the house of God, euen they shall be with thee for the whole worke, with euery free heart that is skilfull in any maner of seruice. The princes also and all the people will be wholy at thy commandement. 
\c 29  
\p
\v 1 Moreouer Dauid the King sayde vnto all the Congregation, God hath chosen Salomon mine onely sonne yong and tender, and the worke is great: for this house is not for man, but for the Lord God. 
\v 2 Now I haue prepared with all my power for the house of my God, golde for vessels of golde, and siluer for them of siluer, and brasse for things of brasse, yron for things of yron, and wood for things of wood, and onix stones, and stones to be set, and carbuncle stones and of diuers colours, and all precious stones, and marble stones in aboundance. 
\v 3 Moreouer, because I haue delite in the house of my God, I haue of mine owne golde and siluer, which I haue giuen to the house of my God, beside all that I haue prepared for the house of the Sanctuarie, 
\v 4 Euen three thousand talents of gold of the golde of Ophir, and seuen thousand talents of fined siluer to ouerlay the walles of the houses. 
\v 5 The golde for the things of golde, and the siluer for things of siluer, and for all the worke by the handes of artificers: and who is willing to fill his hand to day vnto the Lord? 
\v 6 So the princes of the families, and the princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captaines of thousands and of hundreths, with the rulers of the Kings worke, offred willingly, 
\v 7 And they gaue for the seruice of the house of God fiue thousande talents of golde, and ten thousand pieces, and ten thousand talents of siluer, and eighteene thousand talents of brasse, and one hundreth thousand talents of yron. 
\v 8 And they with whom precious stones were found, gaue them to the treasure of ye house of the Lord, by the hand of Iehiel the Gershunnite. 
\v 9 And the people reioyced when they offred willingly: for they offred willingly vnto ye Lord, with a perfite heart. And Dauid the King also reioyced with great ioy. 
\v 10 Therefore Dauid blessed the Lord before all the Congregation, and Dauid sayde, Blessed be thou, O Lord God, of Israel our father, for euer and euer. 
\v 11 Thine, O Lord, is greatnesse and power, and glory, and victorie and praise: for all that is in heauen and in earth is thine: thine is the kingdome, O Lord, and thou excellest as head ouer all. 
\v 12 Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reignest ouer all, and in thine hand is power and strength, and in thine hande it is to make great, and to giue strength vnto all. 
\v 13 Now therefore our God, we thanke thee, and prayse thy glorious Name. 
\v 14 But who am I, and what is my people, that we shoulde be able to offer willingly after this sort? for all things come of thee: and of thine owne hand we haue giuen thee. 
\v 15 For we are stragers before thee, and soiourners, like all our fathers: our dayes are like ye shadowe vpon the earth, and there is none abiding. 
\v 16 O Lord our God, all this abundance that we haue prepared to buylde thee an house for thine holy Name, is of thine hand and all is thine. 
\v 17 I knowe also, my God, that thou tryest the heart, and hast pleasure in righteousnesse: I haue offred willingly in the vprightnesse of mine heart all these things: now also haue I seene thy people which are found here, to offer vnto thee willingly with ioy. 
\v 18 O Lord God of Abraham, Izhak and Israel our fathers, keepe this for euer in the purpose, and the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their hearts vnto thee. 
\v 19 And giue vnto Salomon my sonne a perfit heart to keepe thy commandements, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to doe all things, and to builde the house which I haue prepared. 
\v 20 And Dauid said to all the Congregation, Now blesse the Lord your God. And all the Congregation blessed the Lord God of their fathers, and bowed downe their heads, and worshipped the Lord and the King. 
\v 21 And they offred sacrifices vnto the Lord, and on the morowe after that day, they offered burnt offrings vnto the Lord, euen a thousande yong bullocks, a thousand rammes and a thousand sheepe, with their drinke offrings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel. 
\v 22 And they did eate and drinke before the Lord the same day with great ioy, and they made Salomon the sonne of Dauid King the seconde time, and anoynted him prince before the Lord, and Zadok for the hie Priest. 
\v 23 So Salomon sate on the throne of the Lord, as King in steade of Dauid his father, and prospered: and all Israel obeyed him. 
\v 24 And all the princes and men of power, and all the sonnes of King Dauid submitted them selues vnder King Salomon. 
\v 25 And the Lord magnified Salomon in dignitie, in the sight of all Israel, and gaue him so glorious a kingdome, as no King had before him in Israel. 
\v 26 Thus Dauid the sonne of Ishai reigned ouer all Israel. 
\v 27 And the space that he reigned ouer Israel, was fourtie yeere: seuen yeere reigned he in Hebron, and three and thirtie yeere reigned he in Ierusalem: 
\v 28 And he dyed in a good age, full of dayes, riches and honour, and Salomon his sonne reigned in his steade. 
\v 29 Concerning the actes of Dauid the King first and last, behold, they are written in the booke of Samuel the Seer, and in the booke of Nathan the Prophet, and in the booke of Gad the Seer, 
\v 30 With all his reigne and his power, and times that went ouer him, and ouer Israel and ouer all the kingdomes of the earth.
