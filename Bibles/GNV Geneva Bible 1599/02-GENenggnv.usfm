\v 1 In the beginning God created the heauen and the earth. 
\v 2 And the earth was without forme and void, and darkenesse was vpon the deepe, and the Spirit of God mooued vpon the waters. 
\v 3 Then God said, Let there be light: And there was light. 
\v 4 And God saw the light that it was good, and God separated the light from the darkenes. 
\v 5 And God called the Light, Day, and the darkenes, he called Night. So the euening and the morning were the first day. 
\v 6 Againe God said, Let there be a firmament in the mids of the waters: and let it separate the waters from the waters. 
\v 7 Then God made the firmament, and separated the waters, which were vnder the firmament, from the waters which were aboue the firmament: and it was so. 
\v 8 And God called the firmament Heauen. So the Euening and the morning were the second day. 
\v 9 God said againe, Let the waters vnder the heauen be gathered into one place, and let the dry land appeare. and it was so. 
\v 10 And God called the dry land, Earth, and he called the gathering together of the waters, Seas: and God saw that it was good. 
\v 11 Then God said, Let the earth bud forth the bud of the herbe, that seedeth seed, the fruitfull tree, which beareth fruite according to his kinde, which hath his seede in it selfe vpon the earth: and it was so. 
\v 12 And the earth brought foorth the bud of the herbe, that seedeth seede according to his kind, also the tree that beareth fruit, which hath his seed in it selfe according to his kinde: and God saw that it was good. 
\v 13 So the euening and the morning were the third day. 
\v 14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heauen, to separate the day from the night, and let them be for signes, and for seasons, and for dayes and yeeres. 
\v 15 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heauen to giue light vpon the earth: and it was so. 
\v 16 God then made two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesse light to rule the night: he made also the starres. 
\v 17 And God set them in the firmament of the heauen, to shine vpon the earth, 
\v 18 And to rule in the day, and in the night, and to separate the light from the darkenesse: and God saw that it was good. 
\v 19 So the euening and the morning were the fourth day. 
\v 20 Afterward God said, Let the waters bring foorth in abundance euery creeping thing that hath life: and let the foule flie vpon the earth in the open firmament of the heauen. 
\v 21 Then God created the great whales, and euery thing liuing and mouing, which the waters brought foorth in abundance according to their kinde, and euery fethered foule according to his kinde: and God sawe that it was good. 
\v 22 Then God blessed them, saying, Bring foorth fruite and multiplie, and fill the waters in the seas, and let the foule multiplie in the earth. 
\v 23 So the euening and the morning were the fifte day. 
\v 24 Moreouer God said, Let the earth bring foorth the liuing thing according to his kinde, cattel, and that which creepeth, and the beast of the earth, according to his kinde. and it was so. 
\v 25 And God made the beast of the earth according to his kinde, and the cattell according to his kinde, and euery creeping thing of the earth according to his kind: and God saw that it was good. 
\v 26 Furthermore God said, Let vs make man in our image according to our likenes, and let them rule ouer the fish of the sea, and ouer the foule of the heauen, and ouer the beastes, and ouer all the earth, and ouer euery thing that creepeth and moueth on the earth. 
\v 27 Thus God created the man in his image: in the image of God created he him: he created them male and female. 
\v 28 And God blessed them, and God said to them, Bring forth fruite and multiplie, and fill the earth, and subdue it, and rule ouer the fish of the sea, and ouer the foule of the heauen, and ouer euery beast that moueth vpon the earth. 
\v 29 And God said, Beholde, I haue giuen vnto you euery herbe bearing seede, which is vpon al the earth, and euery tree, wherein is the fruite of a tree bearing seede: that shall be to you for meate. 
\v 30 Likewise to euery beast of the earth, and to euery foule of the heauen, and to euery thing that moueth vpon the earth, which hath life in it selfe, euery greene herbe shall be for meate. and it was so. 
\v 31 And God sawe all that he had made, and loe, it was very good. So the euening and the morning were the sixt day. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 Thus the heauens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. 
\v 2 For in the seuenth day GOD ended his worke which he had made, and the seuenth day he rested from al his worke, which he had made. 
\v 3 So God blessed the seuenth day, and sanctified it, because that in it he had rested from all his worke, which God had created and made. 
\v 4 These are the generations of the heauens and of the earth, when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heauens, 
\v 5 And euery plant of the fielde, before it was in the earth, and euery herbe of the field, before it grewe: for the Lord God had not caused it to raine vpon the earth, neither was there a man to till the ground, 
\v 6 But a myst went vp from the earth, and watered all the earth. 
\v 7 The Lord God also made the man of the dust of the grounde, and breathed in his face breath of life, and the man was a liuing soule. 
\v 8 And the Lord God planted a garden Eastward in Eden, and there he put the man whom he had made. 
\v 9 (For out of the ground made the Lord God to grow euery tree pleasant to the sight, and good for meate: the tree of life also in the mids of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and of euill. 
\v 10 And out of Eden went a riuer to water the garden, and from thence it was deuided, and became into foure heads. 
\v 11 The name of one is Pishon: the same compasseth the whole land of Hauilah, where is golde. 
\v 12 And the golde of that land is good: there is Bdelium, and the Onix stone. 
\v 13 And the name of the seconde riuer is Gihon: the same compasseth the whole lande of Cush. 
\v 14 The name also of the third riuer is Hiddekel: this goeth toward the Eastside of Asshur: and the fourth riuer is Perath) 
\v 15 Then the Lord God tooke the man, and put him into the garden of Eden, that he might dresse it and keepe it. 
\v 16 And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Thou shalt eate freely of euery tree of the garden, 
\v 17 But of the tree of knowledge of good and euill, thou shalt not eate of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt die the death. 
\v 18 Also the Lord God saide, It is not good that the man should be himself alone: I wil make him an helpe meete for him. 
\v 19 So the Lord God formed of the earth euery beast of the fielde, and euery foule of the heauen, and brought them vnto the man to see howe he would call them: for howsoeuer the man named the liuing creature, so was the name thereof. 
\v 20 The man therefore gaue names vnto all cattell, and to the foule of the heauen, and to euery beast of the fielde: but for Adam founde he not an helpe meete for him. 
\v 21 Therefore the Lord God caused an heauie sleepe to fall vpon the man, and he slept: and he tooke one of his ribbes, and closed vp the flesh in steade thereof. 
\v 22 And the ribbe which the Lord God had taken from the man, made he a woman, and brought her to the man. 
\v 23 Then the man said, This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. She shalbe called woman, because she was taken out of man. 
\v 24 Therefore shall man leaue his father and his mother, and shall cleaue to his wife, and they shall be one flesh. 
\v 25 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 Now the serpent was more subtill then any beast of the fielde, which the Lord God had made: and he said to the woman, Yea, hath God in deede said, Ye shall not eate of euery tree of the garden? 
\v 2 And the woman said vnto the serpent, We eate of the fruite of the trees of the garden, 
\v 3 But of the fruite of the tree which is in the middes of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eate of it, neither shall ye touche it, lest ye die. 
\v 4 Then the serpent said to the woman, Ye shall not die at all, 
\v 5 But God doeth knowe, that when ye shall eate thereof, your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and euill. 
\v 6 So the woman (seeing that the tree was good for meate, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to get knowledge) tooke of the fruite thereof, and did eate, and gaue also to her husband with her, and he did eate. 
\v 7 Then the eyes of them both were opened, and they knewe that they were naked, and they sewed figge tree leaues together, and made them selues breeches. 
\v 8 Afterward they heard the voyce of the Lord God walking in the garden in the coole of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselues from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden. 
\v 9 But the Lord God called to the man, and said vnto him, Where art thou? 
\v 10 Who saide, I heard thy voyce in the garden, and was afraide: because I was naked, therefore I hid my selfe. 
\v 11 And he saide, Who tolde thee, that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eate? 
\v 12 Then the man saide, The woman which thou gauest to be with me, she gaue me of the tree, and I did eate. 
\v 13 And the Lord God saide to the woman, Why hast thou done this? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eate. 
\v 14 Then the Lord God said to the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed aboue all cattell, and aboue euery beast of the fielde: vpon thy belly shalt thou goe, and dust shalt thou eate all the dayes of thy life. 
\v 15 I will also put enimitie betweene thee and the woman, and betweene thy seede and her seede. He shall breake thine head, and thou shalt bruise his heele. 
\v 16 Vnto the woman he said, I will greatly increase thy sorowes, and thy conceptions. In sorowe shalt thou bring foorth children, and thy desire shalbe subiect to thine husband, and he shall rule ouer thee. 
\v 17 Also to Adam he said, Because thou hast obeyed the voyce of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, (whereof I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eate of it) cursed is the earth for thy sake: in sorowe shalt thou eate of it all the dayes of thy life. 
\v 18 Thornes also, and thistles shall it bring foorth to thee, and thou shalt eate the herbe of the fielde. 
\v 19 In the sweate of thy face shalt thou eate bread, till thou returne to the earth: for out of it wast thou taken, because thou art dust, and to dust shalt thou returne. 
\v 20 (And the man called his wiues name Heuah, because she was the mother of all liuing) 
\v 21 Vnto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coates of skinnes, and clothed them. 
\v 22 And the Lord God said, Beholde, the man is become as one of vs, to knowe good and euill. And nowe lest he put foorth his hand, and take also of ye tree of life and eate and liue for euer, 
\v 23 Therefore the Lord God sent him foorth from the garden of Eden, to till ye earth, whence he was taken. 
\v 24 Thus he cast out man, and at the East side of the garden of Eden he set the Cherubims, and the blade of a sworde shaken, to keepe the way of the tree of life. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 Afterward the man knew Heuah his wife, which conceiued and bare Kain, and said, I haue obteined a man by the Lord. 
\v 2 And againe she brought foorth his brother Habel, and Habel was a keeper of sheepe, and Kain was a tiller of the ground. 
\v 3 And in processe of time it came to passe, that Kain brought an oblation vnto the Lord of the fruite of the ground. 
\v 4 And Habel also him selfe brought of the first fruites of his sheepe, and of the fat of them, and the Lord had respect vnto Habel, and to his offering, 
\v 5 But vnto Kain and to his offering he had no regarde: wherefore Kain was exceeding wroth, and his countenance fell downe. 
\v 6 Then ye Lord said vnto Kain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance cast downe? 
\v 7 If thou do well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sinne lieth at the doore: also vnto thee his desire shalbe subiect, and thou shalt rule ouer him. 
\v 8 Then Kain spake to Habel his brother. And when they were in the fielde, Kain rose vp against Habel his brother, and slewe him. 
\v 9 Then the Lord said vnto Kain, Where is Habel thy brother? Who answered, I cannot tell. Am I my brothers keeper? 
\v 10 Againe he said, What hast thou done? the voyce of thy brothers blood cryeth vnto me from the earth. 
\v 11 Now therefore thou art cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receiue thy brothers blood from thine hand. 
\v 12 When thou shalt till the grounde, it shall not henceforth yeelde vnto thee her strength: a vagabond and a runnagate shalt thou be in the earth. 
\v 13 Then Kain said to the Lord, My punishment is greater, then I can beare. 
\v 14 Behold, thou hast cast me out this day from the earth, and from thy face shall I be hid, and shalbe a vagabond, and a runnagate in the earth, and whosoeuer findeth me, shall slay me. 
\v 15 Then the Lord said vnto him, Doubtlesse whosoeuer slayeth Kain, he shalbe punished seue folde. And the Lord set a marke vpon Kain, lest any man finding him should kill him. 
\v 16 Then Kain went out from the presence of the Lord, and dwelt in the land of Nod towarde the Eastside of Eden. 
\v 17 Kain also knewe his wife, which conceiued and bare Henoch: and he built a citie, and called the name of the citie by ye name of his sonne, Henoch. 
\v 18 And to Henoch was borne Irad, and Irad begate Mehuiael, and Mehuiael begate Methushael, and Methushael begate Lamech. 
\v 19 And Lamech tooke him two wiues: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah. 
\v 20 And Adah bare Iabal, who was the father of such as dwell in the tents, and of such as haue cattell. 
\v 21 And his brothers name was Iubal, who was the father of all that play on the harpe and organes. 
\v 22 And Zillah also bare Tubal-kain, who wrought cunningly euery craft of brasse and of yron: and the sister of Tubal-kain was Naamah. 
\v 23 Then Lamech saide vnto his wiues Adah and Zillah, Heare my voyce, ye wiues of Lamech: hearken vnto my speach: for I would slay a man in my wound, and a yong man in mine hurt. 
\v 24 If Kain shalbe auenged seuen folde, truely Lamech, seuentie times seuen folde. 
\v 25 And Adam knewe his wife againe, and she bare a sonne, and she called his name Sheth: for God, saide she, hath appointed me another seede for Habel, because Kain slewe him. 
\v 26 And to ye same Sheth also there was borne a sonne, and he called his name Enosh. Then beganne men to call vpon the name of the Lord. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 This is the booke of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created Adam, in the likenes of God made he him, 
\v 2 Male and female created he them, and blessed them, and called their name Adam in the day that they were created. 
\v 3 Nowe Adam liued an hundred and thirtie yeeres, and begate a childe in his owne likenes after his image, and called his name Sheth. 
\v 4 And the dayes of Adam, after he had begotten Sheth, were eight hundreth yeeres, and he begate sonnes and daughters. 
\v 5 So all the dayes that Adam liued, were nine hundreth and thirtie yeeres: and he died. 
\v 6 And Sheth liued an hundreth and fiue yeeres, and begate Enosh. 
\v 7 And Sheth liued, after he begate Enosh, eight hundreth and seuen yeeres, and begate sonnes and daughters. 
\v 8 So all the dayes of Sheth were nine hundreth and twelue yeeres: and he died. 
\v 9 Also Enosh liued ninetie yeeres, and begate Kenan. 
\v 10 And Enosh liued, after he begate Kenan, eight hundreth and fifteene yeeres, and begate sonnes and daughters. 
\v 11 So all the dayes of Enosh were nine hundreth and fiue yeeres: and he died 
\v 12 Likewise Kenan liued seuentie yeeres, and begate Mahalaleel. 
\v 13 And Kenan liued, after he begate Mahalaleel, eight hundreth and fourtie yeeres, and begate sonnes and daughters. 
\v 14 So all the dayes of Kenan were nine hundreth and tenne yeeres: and he died. 
\v 15 Mahalaleel also liued sixtie and fiue yeres, and begate Iered. 
\v 16 Also Mahalaleel liued, after he begate Iered, eight hundreth and thirtie yeeres, and begate sonnes and daughters. 
\v 17 So all the dayes of Mahalaleel were eight hundreth ninetie and fiue yeeres: and he died. 
\v 18 And Iered liued an hundreth sixtie and two yeeres, and begate Henoch. 
\v 19 Then Iered liued, after he begate Henoch, eight hundreth yeeres, and begate sonnes and daughters. 
\v 20 So all the dayes of Iered were nine hundreth sixtie and two yeeres: and he died. 
\v 21 Also Henoch liued sixtie and fiue yeeres, and begate Methushelah. 
\v 22 And Henoch walked with God, after he begate Methushelah, three hundreth yeeres, and begate sonnes and daughters. 
\v 23 So all the dayes of Henoch were three hundreth sixtie and fiue yeeres. 
\v 24 And Henoch walked with God, and he was no more seene: for God tooke him away. 
\v 25 Methushelah also liued an hundreth eightie and seuen yeeres, and begate Lamech. 
\v 26 And Methushelah liued, after he begate Lamech, seuen hundreth eightie and two yeeres, and begate sonnes and daughters. 
\v 27 So al the dayes of Methushelah were nine hundreth sixtie and nine yeeres: and he died. 
\v 28 Then Lamech liued an hundreth eightie and two yeeres, and begate a sonne, 
\v 29 And called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort vs concerning our worke and sorowe of our hands, as touching the earth, which the Lord hath cursed. 
\v 30 And Lamech liued, after he begate Noah, fiue hundreth ninetie and fiue yeeres, and begate sonnes and daughters. 
\v 31 So all the dayes of Lamech were seuen hundreth seuentie and seuen yeeres: and he died. 
\v 32 And Noah was fiue hundreth yeere olde. And Noah begate Shem, Ham and Iapheth. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1 So when men began to be multiplied vpon the earth, and there were daughters borne vnto them, 
\v 2 Then the sonnes of God sawe the daughters of men that they were faire, and they tooke them wiues of all that they liked. 
\v 3 Therefore the Lord saide, My Spirit shall not alway striue with man, because he is but flesh, and his dayes shalbe an hundreth and twentie yeeres. 
\v 4 There were gyants in the earth in those dayes: yea, and after that the sonnes of God came vnto the daughters of men, and they had borne them children, these were mightie men, which in olde time were men of renoume. 
\v 5 When the Lord sawe that the wickednesse of man was great in the earth, and all the imaginations of the thoughtes of his heart were onely euill continually, 
\v 6 Then it repented ye Lord, that he had made man in the earth, and he was sorie in his heart. 
\v 7 Therefore ye Lord said, I will destroy from the earth the man, whom I haue created, from man to beast, to the creeping thing, and to the foule of the heauen: for I repent that I haue made them. 
\v 8 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord. 
\v 9 These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a iust and vpright man in his time: and Noah walked with God. 
\v 10 And Noah begate three sonnes, Shem, Ham and Iapheth. 
\v 11 The earth also was corrupt before God: for the earth was filled with crueltie. 
\v 12 Then God looked vpon the earth, and beholde, it was corrupt: for all flesh had corrupt his way vpon the earth. 
\v 13 And God said vnto Noah, An ende of all flesh is come before me: for the earth is filled with crueltie through them: and beholde, I wil destroy them with the earth. 
\v 14 Make thee an Arke of pine trees: thou shalt make cabines in the Arke, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch. 
\v 15 And thus shalt thou make it: The length of the Arke shalbe three hundreth cubites, the breadth of it fiftie cubites, and the height of it thirtie cubites. 
\v 16 A windowe shalt thou make in the Arke, and in a cubite shalt thou finish it aboue, and the doore of the Arke shalt thou set in the side thereof: thou shalt make it with the lowe, seconde and third roume. 
\v 17 And I, beholde, I will bring a flood of waters vpon the earth to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life vnder the heauen: all that is in the earth shall perish. 
\v 18 But with thee will I establish my couenant, and thou shalt goe into the Arke, thou, and thy sonnes, and thy wife, and thy sonnes wiues with thee. 
\v 19 And of euery liuing thing, of all flesh two of euery sort shalt thou cause to come into the Arke, to keepe them aliue with thee: they shalbe male and female. 
\v 20 Of the foules, after their kinde, and of the cattell after their kind, of euery creeping thing of the earth after his kinde, two of euery sort shall come vnto thee, that thou mayest keepe them aliue. 
\v 21 And take thou with thee of all meate that is eaten: and thou shalt gather it to thee, that it may be meate for thee and for them. 
\v 22 Noah therefore did according vnto all, that God commanded him: euen so did he. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord said vnto Noah, Enter thou and all thine house into the Arke: for thee haue I seene righteous before me in this age. 
\v 2 Of euery cleane beast thou shalt take to thee by seuens, the male and his female: but of vncleane beastes by couples, the male and his female. 
\v 3 Of the foules also of the heauen by seuens, male and female, to keepe seede aliue vpon the whole earth. 
\v 4 For seuen dayes hence I will cause it raine vpon the earth fourtie dayes and fourtie nightes, and all the substance that I haue made, will I destroy from off the earth. 
\v 5 Noah therefore did according vnto all that the Lord commanded him. 
\v 6 And Noah was sixe hundreth yeeres olde, when the flood of waters was vpon the earth. 
\v 7 So Noah entred and his sonnes, and his wife, and his sonnes wiues with him into the Arke, because of the waters of the flood. 
\v 8 Of the cleane beastes, and of the vncleane beastes, and of the foules, and of all that creepeth vpon the earth, 
\v 9 There came two and two vnto Noah into the Arke, male and female, as God had commanded Noah. 
\v 10 And so after seuen dayes the waters of the flood were vpon the earth. 
\v 11 In the sixe hundreth yeere of Noahs life in the second moneth, the seuetenth day of the moneth, in the same day were all the fountaines of the great deepe broken vp, and the windowes of heauen were opened, 
\v 12 And the raine was vpon the earth fourtie dayes and fourtie nightes. 
\v 13 In the selfe same day entred Noah with Shem, and Ham and Iapheth, the sonnes of Noah, and Noahs wife, and the three wiues of his sonnes with them into the Arke. 
\v 14 They and euery beast after his kinde, and all cattell after their kinde, and euery thing that creepeth and moueth vpon the earth after his kinde, and euery foule after his kinde, euen euery bird of euery fether. 
\v 15 For they came to Noah into ye Arke, two and two, of all flesh wherein is ye breath of life. 
\v 16 And they entring in, came male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the Lord shut him in. 
\v 17 Then ye flood was fourtie dayes vpon the earth, and the waters were increased, and bare vp the Arke, which was lift vp aboue the earth. 
\v 18 The waters also waxed strong, and were increased exceedingly vpon the earth, and the Arke went vpon the waters. 
\v 19 The waters preuailed so exceedingly vpon the earth, that all the high mountaines, that are vnder the whole heauen, were couered. 
\v 20 Fifteene cubites vpwarde did the waters preuaile, when the mountaines were couered. 
\v 21 Then all flesh perished that moued vpon the earth, both foule and cattell and beast, and euery thing that creepeth and moueth vpon the earth, and euery man. 
\v 22 Euery thing in whose nostrels the spirit of life did breathe, whatsoeuer they were in the drie land, they died. 
\v 23 So he destroyed euery thing that was vpon the earth, from man to beast, to ye creeping thing, and to the foule of the heauen: they were euen destroyed from the earth. And Noah onely remained; and they that were with him in ye Arke. 
\v 24 And the waters preuailed vpon the earth an hundreth and fiftie dayes. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1 Now God remembred Noah and euery beast, and all the cattell that was with him in the Arke: therefore God made a winde to passe vpon the earth, and the waters ceased. 
\v 2 The fountaines also of the deepe and the windowes of heauen were stopped and the raine from heauen was restrained, 
\v 3 And the waters returned from aboue the earth, going and returning: and after the ende of the hundreth and fiftieth day the waters abated. 
\v 4 And in the seuenth moneth, in the seuenteenth day of the moneth, the Arke rested vpon the mountaines of Ararat. 
\v 5 And the waters were going and decreasing vntill the tenth moneth: in the tenth moneth, and in the first day of the moneth were the toppes of the mountaines seene. 
\v 6 So after fourtie dayes, Noah opened the windowe of the Arke, which he had made, 
\v 7 And sent forth a rauen, which went out going forth and returning, vntill the waters were dried vp vpon the earth. 
\v 8 Againe he sent a doue from him, that he might see if the waters were diminished from off the earth. 
\v 9 But the doue found no rest for the sole of her foote: therefore she returned vnto him into the Arke (for the waters were vpon the whole earth) and he put forth his hand, and receiued her, and tooke her to him into the Arke. 
\v 10 And he abode yet other seuen dayes, and againe he sent forth the doue out of the Arke. 
\v 11 And the doue came to him in ye euening, and loe, in her mouth was an oliue leafe that she had pluckt: whereby Noah knewe that the waters were abated from off the earth. 
\v 12 Notwithstanding he wayted yet other seuen dayes, and sent forth the doue, which returned not againe vnto him any more. 
\v 13 And in the sixe hundreth and one yeere, in the first day of the first moneth the waters were dryed vp from off the earth: and Noah remoued the couering of the Arke and looked, and beholde, the vpper part of the ground was drie. 
\v 14 And in the second moneth, in the seuen and twentieth day of the moneth was the earth drie. 
\v 15 Then God spake to Noah, saying, 
\v 16 Goe forth of the Arke, thou and thy wife, and thy sonnes and thy sonnes wiues with thee. 
\v 17 Bring forth with thee euery beast that is with thee, of all flesh, both foule and cattell, and euery thing that creepeth and moueth vpon the earth, that they may breede abundantly in ye earth, and bring forth fruite and increase vpon ye earth. 
\v 18 So Noah came forth, and his sonnes, and his wife, and his sonnes wiues with him. 
\v 19 Euery beast, euery creeping thing, and euery foule, all that moueth vpon the earth after their kindes went out of the Arke. 
\v 20 Then Noah built an altar to the Lord and tooke of euery cleane beast, and of euery cleane foule, and offered burnt offerings vpon the altar. 
\v 21 And the Lord smellled a sauour of rest, and the Lord said in his heart, I will hencefoorth curse the ground no more for mans cause: for the imagination of mans heart is euill, euen from his youth: neither will I smite any more all things liuing, as I haue done. 
\v 22 Hereafter seede time and haruest, and colde and heate, and sommer and winter, and day and night shall not cease, so long as ye earth remaineth. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 And God blessed Noah and his sonnes, and said to them, Bring foorth fruite, and multiplie, and replenish the earth. 
\v 2 Also the feare of you, and the dread of you shalbe vpon euery beast of the earth, and vpon euery foule of the heauen, vpon all that moueth on the earth, and vpon all the fishes of the sea: into your hand are they deliuered. 
\v 3 Euery thing that moueth and liueth, shall be meate for you: as the greene herbe, haue I giuen you all things. 
\v 4 But flesh with the life thereof, I meane, with the blood thereof, shall ye not eate. 
\v 5 For surely I will require your blood, wherein your liues are: at the hand of euery beast will I require it: and at the hand of man, euen at the hand of a mans brother will I require the life of man. 
\v 6 Who so sheadeth mans blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God hath he made man. 
\v 7 But bring ye forth fruite and multiplie: grow plentifully in the earth, and increase therein. 
\v 8 God spake also to Noah and to his sonnes with him, saying, 
\v 9 Behold, I, euen I establish my couenant with you, and with your seede after you, 
\v 10 And with euery liuing creature that is with you, with the foule, with the cattell, and with euery beast of the earth with you, from all that goe out of the Arke, vnto euery beast of the earth. 
\v 11 And my couenant will I establish with you, that from henceforth all flesh shall not be rooted out by ye waters of the flood, neither shall there be a flood to destroy the earth any more. 
\v 12 Then God saide, This is the token of the couenant which I make betweene me and you, and betweene euery liuing thing, that is with you vnto perpetuall generations. 
\v 13 I haue set my bowe in the cloude, and it shalbe for a signe of the couenant betweene me and the earth. 
\v 14 And when I shall couer the earth with a cloud, and the bowe shall be seene in the cloude, 
\v 15 Then will I remember my couenant, which is betweene me and you, and betweene euery liuing thing in all flesh, and there shalbe no more waters of a flood to destroy all flesh. 
\v 16 Therefore the bowe shalbe in the cloude, that I may see it, and remember the euerlasting couenant betweene God, and euery liuing thing in all flesh that is vpon the earth. 
\v 17 God said yet to Noah, This is the signe of the couenant, which I haue established betweene me and all flesh that is vpon the earth. 
\v 18 Nowe the sonnes of Noah going foorth of the Arke, were Shem and Ham and Iapheth. And Ham is the father of Canaan. 
\v 19 These are the three sonnes of Noah, and of them was the whole earth ouerspred. 
\v 20 Noah also began to be an husband man and planted a vineyard. 
\v 21 And he drunke of ye wine and was drunken, and was vncouered in the middes of his tent. 
\v 22 And when Ham the father of Canaan sawe the nakednesse of his father, he tolde his two brethren without. 
\v 23 Then tooke Shem and Iapheth a garment, and put it vpon both their shoulders, and went backwarde, and couered the nakednesse of their father with their faces backwarde: so they sawe not their fathers nakednesse. 
\v 24 Then Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his yonger sonne had done vnto him, 
\v 25 And said, Cursed be Canaan: a seruant of seruants shall he be vnto his brethren. 
\v 26 He said moreouer, blessed be the Lord God of Shem, and let Canaan be his seruant. 
\v 27 God perswade Iapheth, that he may dwell in the tentes of Shem, and let Canaan be his seruant. 
\v 28 And Noah liued after the flood three hundreth and fiftie yeeres. 
\v 29 So all the dayes of Noah were nine hundreth and fiftie yeeres: and he died. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1 Now these are the generations of the sonnes of Noah, Shem, Ham and Iapheth: vnto whom sonnes were borne after the flood. 
\v 2 The sonnes of Iapheth were Gomer and Magog, and Madai, and Iauan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras. 
\v 3 And the sonnes of Gomer, Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah. 
\v 4 Also the sonnes of Iauan, Elishah and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. 
\v 5 Of these were the yles of the Gentiles deuided in their landes, euery man after his tongue, and after their families in their nations. 
\v 6 Moreouer, ye sonnes of Ham were Cush, and Mizraim, and Put, and Canaan. 
\v 7 And the sonnes of Cush, Seba and Hauilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtecha: also the sonnes of Raamah were Sheba and Dedan. 
\v 8 And Cush begate Nimrod, who began to be mightie in the earth. 
\v 9 He was a mightie hunter before the Lord. wherefore it is saide, As Nimrod the mightie hunter before the Lord. 
\v 10 And the beginning of his kingdome was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. 
\v 11 Out of that land came Asshur, and builded Niniueh, and the citie Rehoboth, and Calah: 
\v 12 Resen also betweene Niniueh and Calah: this is a great citie. 
\v 13 And Mizraim begate Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim. 
\v 14 Pathrusim also, and Casluhim (out of whom came the Philistims) and Caphtorims. 
\v 15 Also Canaan begat Zidon his first borne, and Heth, 
\v 16 And Iebusi, and Emori, and Girgashi, 
\v 17 And Hiui, and Arki, and Sini, 
\v 18 And Aruadi, and Zemari, and Hamathi: and afterwarde were the families of the Canaanites spred abroade. 
\v 19 Then the border of the Canaanites was from Zidon, as thou commest to Gerar vntil Azzah, and as thou goest vnto Sodom, and Gomorah, and Admah, and Zeboijm, euen vnto Lasha. 
\v 20 These are the sonnes of Ham according to their families, according to their tongues in their countries and in their nations. 
\v 21 Vnto Shem also the father of all the sonnes of Eber, and elder brother of Iapheth were children borne. 
\v 22 The sonnes of Shem were Elam and Asshur, and Arpachshad, and Lud, and Aram. 
\v 23 And the sonnes of Aram, Vz and Hul, and Gether and Mash. 
\v 24 Also Arpachshad begate Shelah, and Shelah begate Eber. 
\v 25 Vnto Eber also were borne two sonnes: the name of the one was Peleg: for in his dayes was the earth diuided: and his brothers name was Ioktan. 
\v 26 Then Ioktan begate Almodad and Sheleph, and Hazarmaueth, and Ierah, 
\v 27 And Hadoram, and Vzal, and Dicklah, 
\v 28 And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba, 
\v 29 And Ophir, and Hauilah, and Iobab: all these were the sonnes of Ioktan. 
\v 30 And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest vnto Sephar a mount of the East. 
\v 31 These are the sonnes of Shem according to their families, according to their tongues, in their countreis and nations. 
\v 32 These are the families of the sonnes of Noah, after their generations among their people: and out of these were the nations diuided in the earth after the flood. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 Then the whole earth was of one language and one speache. 
\v 2 And as they went from the East, they found a plaine in the land of Shinar, and there they abode. 
\v 3 And they said one to another, Come, let vs make bricke, and burne it in the fire. So they had bricke for stone, and slime had they in steade of morter. 
\v 4 Also they said, Goe to, let vs builde vs a citie and a towre, whose top may reache vnto the heauen, that we may get vs a name, lest we be scattered vpon the whole earth. 
\v 5 But the Lord came downe, to see the citie and towre, which the sonnes of men builded. 
\v 6 And the Lord said, Beholde, the people is one, and they all haue one language, and this they begin to doe, neither can they now be stopped from whatsoeuer they haue imagined to do. 
\v 7 Come on, let vs goe downe, and there confound their language, that euery one perceiue not anothers speache. 
\v 8 So ye Lord scattered them from thence vpon all the earth, and they left off to build the citie. 
\v 9 Therefore the name of it was called Babel, because the Lord did there confounde the language of all the earth: from thence then did the Lord scatter them vpon all the earth. 
\v 10 These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundreth yeere olde, and begate Arpachshad two yeere after the flood. 
\v 11 And Shem liued, after he begate Arpachshad, fiue hundreth yeeres, and begate sonnes and daughters. 
\v 12 Also Arpachshad liued fiue and thirtie yeeres, and begate Shelah. 
\v 13 And Arpachshad liued, after he begate Shelah, foure hundreth and three yeeres, and begate sonnes and daughters. 
\v 14 And Shelah liued thirtie yeeres, and begat Eber. 
\v 15 So Shelah liued, after he begat Eber, foure hundreth and three yeeres, and begat sonnes and daughters. 
\v 16 Likewise Eber liued foure and thirtie yeres, and begate Peleg. 
\v 17 So Eber liued, after he begate Peleg, foure hundreth and thirtie yeeres, and begate sonnes and daughters 
\v 18 And Peleg liued thirtie yeeres, and begate Reu. 
\v 19 And Peleg liued, after he begate Reu, two hundreth and nine yeeres, and begate sonnes and daughters. 
\v 20 Also Reu liued two and thirtie yeeres, and begate Serug. 
\v 21 So Reu liued, after he begate Serug, two hundreth and seuen yeeres, and begate sonnes and daughters. 
\v 22 Moreouer Serug liued thirtie yeeres, and begate Nahor. 
\v 23 And Serug liued, after he begate Nahor, two hundreth yeeres, and begate sonnes and daughters. 
\v 24 And Nahor liued nine and twentie yeeres, and begate Terah. 
\v 25 So Nahor liued, after he begate Terah, an hundreth and nineteene yeeres, and begat sonnes and daughters. 
\v 26 So Terah liued seuentie yeeres, and begate Abram, Nahor, and Haran. 
\v 27 Nowe these are the generations of Terah: Terah begate Abram, Nahor, and Haran: and Haran begate Lot. 
\v 28 Then Haran died before Terah his father in the land of his natiuitie, in Vr of the Caldees. 
\v 29 So Abram and Nahor tooke them wiues. The name of Abrams wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahors wife Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah. 
\v 30 But Sarai was barren, and had no childe. 
\v 31 Then Terah tooke Abram his sonne, and Lot the sonne of Haran, his sonnes sonne, and Sarai his daughter in lawe, his sonne Abrams wife: and they departed together from Vr of the Caldees, to goe into the land of Canaan, and they came to Haran, and dwelt there. 
\v 32 So the dayes of Terah were two hundreth and fiue yeeres, and Terah died in Haran. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 For the Lord had said vnto Abram, Get thee out of thy countrey, and from thy kindred, and from thy fathers house vnto the land that I will shewe thee. 
\v 2 And I will make of thee a great nation, and will blesse thee, and make thy name great, and thou shalt be a blessing. 
\v 3 I will also blesse them that blesse thee, and curse them that curse thee, and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed. 
\v 4 So Abram departed, euen as ye Lord spake vnto him, and Lot went with him. (And Abram was seuentie and fiue yeere olde, when he departed out of Haran) 
\v 5 Then Abram tooke Sarai his wife, and Lot his brothers sonne, and all their substance that they possessed, and the soules that they had gotten in Haran, and they departed, to goe to the land of Canaan: and to the land of Canaan they came. 
\v 6 So Abram passed through the land vnto the place of Shechem, and vnto the plaine of Moreh (and the Canaanite was then in ye land) 
\v 7 And the Lord appeared vnto Abram, and said, Vnto thy seede will I giue this land. And there builded he an altar vnto the Lord, which appeared vnto him. 
\v 8 Afterward remouing thence vnto a moutaine Eastward from Beth-el, he pitched his tent hauing Beth-el on the Westside, and Haai on the East: and there he built an altar vnto the Lord, and called on the Name of the Lord. 
\v 9 Againe Abram went forth going and iourneying toward the South. 
\v 10 Then there came a famine in the land: therefore Abram went downe into Egypt to soiourne there: for there was a great famine in the lande. 
\v 11 And when he drewe neere to enter into Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife, Beholde nowe, I know that thou art a faire woman to looke vpon: 
\v 12 Therefore it will come to passe, that when the Egyptians see thee, they will say, She is his wife: so will they kill me, but they will keepe thee aliue. 
\v 13 Say, I pray thee, that thou art my sister, that I may fare well for thy sake, and that my life may be preserued by thee. 
\v 14 Nowe when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians behelde the woman: for she was very faire. 
\v 15 And the Princes of Pharaoh sawe her, and commended her vnto Pharaoh: so the woman was taken into Pharaohs house: 
\v 16 Who intreated Abram well for her sake, and he had sheepe, and beeues, and hee asses, and men seruants and maide seruants, and shee asses, and camelles. 
\v 17 But the Lord plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues, because of Sarai Abrams wife. 
\v 18 Then Pharaoh called Abram, and saide, Why hast thou done this vnto me? Wherefore diddest thou not tell me, that she was thy wife? 
\v 19 Why saidest thou, She is my sister, that I should take her to be my wife? Nowe therefore beholde thy wife, take her and goe thy way. 
\v 20 And Pharaoh gaue men commandement concerning him: and they conueyed him forth, and his wife, and all that he had. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 Then Abram went vp from Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him toward the South. 
\v 2 And Abram was very rich in cattell, in siluer and in golde. 
\v 3 And he went on his iourney from ye South toward Beth-el, to the place where his tent had bene at ye beginning, betweene Beth-el and Haai, 
\v 4 Vnto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the Name of the Lord. 
\v 5 And Lot also, who went with Abram, had sheepe, and cattell and tentes, 
\v 6 So that the land coulde not beare them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they coulde not dwell together. 
\v 7 Also there was debate betweene ye heardmen of Abrams cattell, and the heardmen of Lots cattell. (and the Canaanites and the Perizzites dwelled at that time in the land.) 
\v 8 Then saide Abram vnto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, betweene thee and me, neither betweene mine heardmen and thine heardmen: for we be brethren. 
\v 9 Is not the whole land before thee? depart I pray thee from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will goe to the right: or if thou goe to the right hand, then I will take the left. 
\v 10 So when Lot lifted vp his eyes, he saw that all the plaine of Iorden was watered euery where: (for before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorah, it was as the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, as thou goest vnto Zoar) 
\v 11 Then Lot chose vnto him all the plaine of Iorden, and tooke his iourney from the East: and they departed the one from the other. 
\v 12 Abram dwelled in the lande of Canaan, and Lot abode in the cities of the plaine, and pitched his tent euen to Sodom. 
\v 13 Now the men of Sodom were wicked and exceeding sinners against the Lord. 
\v 14 Then the Lord saide vnto Abram, (after that Lot was departed from him) Lift vp thine eyes nowe, and looke from the place where thou art, Northward, and Southward, and Eastwarde, and Westward: 
\v 15 For all the land, which thou seest, will I giue vnto thee and to thy seede for euer, 
\v 16 And I will make thy seede, as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seede be numbred. 
\v 17 Arise, walke through the land, in ye length thereof, and breadth thereof: for I will giue it vnto thee. 
\v 18 Then Abram remoued his tent, and came and dwelled in the plaine of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and builded there an altar vnto ye Lord. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1 And in the dayes of Amraphel King of Shinar, Arioch King of Ellasar, Chedor-laomer King of Elam, and Tidal king of the nations: 
\v 2 These men made warre with Bera King of Sodom, and with Birsha King of Gomorah, Shinab King of Admah, and Shemeber King of Zeboiim, and the King of Bela, which is Zoar. 
\v 3 All these ioyned together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt Sea. 
\v 4 Twelue yeere were they subiect to Chedor-laomer, but in the thirteenth yeere they rebelled. 
\v 5 And in the fourteenth yeere came Chedor-laomer, and the Kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaueh Kiriathaim, 
\v 6 And the Horites in their mount Seir, vnto the plaine of Paran, which is by the wildernesse. 
\v 7 And they returned and came to En-mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the countrey of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites that dwelled in Hazezon-tamar. 
\v 8 Then went out the King of Sodom, and the King of Gomorah, and the King of Admah, and the King of Zeboiim, and the King of Bela, which is Zoar: and they ioyned battell with them in the vale of Siddim: 
\v 9 To wit, with Chedor-laomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar: foure Kings against fiue. 
\v 10 Now the vale of Siddim was full of slime pits, and the Kings of Sodom and Gomorah fled and fell there: and ye residue fled to the mountaine. 
\v 11 Then they tooke all the substance of Sodom and Gomorah, and al their vitailes and went their way. 
\v 12 They tooke Lot also Abrams brothers sonne and his substance (for he dwelt at Sodom) and departed. 
\v 13 Then came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Ebrew, which dwelt in the plaine of Mamre ye Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner, which were confederat with Abram. 
\v 14 When Abram heard that his brother was taken, he brought forth of them that were borne and brought vp in his house, three hundreth and eighteene, and pursued them vnto Dan. 
\v 15 Then he, and his seruants deuided them selues against them by night, and smote them and pursued them vnto Hobah, which is on the left side of Damascus, 
\v 16 And he recouered all the substance, and also brought againe his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also and the people. 
\v 17 After that he returned from the slaughter of Chedor-laomer, and of the Kings that were with him, came the King of Sodom foorth to meete him in the valley of Shaueh, which is the Kings dale. 
\v 18 And Melchi-zedek King of Shalem brought foorth bread and wine: and he was a Priest of the most high God. 
\v 19 Therefore he blessed him, saying, Blessed art thou, Abram, of God most high possessour of heauen and earth, 
\v 20 And blessed be the most high God, which hath deliuered thine enemies into thine hand. And Abram gaue him tythe of all. 
\v 21 Then the King of Sodom saide to Abram, Giue me the persons, and take the goodes to thy selfe. 
\v 22 And Abram said to the King of Sodom, I haue lift vp mine hand vnto the Lord the most hie God possessor of heauen and earth, 
\v 23 That I will not take of all that is thine, so much as a threde or shoolatchet, lest thou shouldest say, I haue made Abram riche, 
\v 24 Saue onely that, which the yong men haue eaten, and the partes of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre: let them take their partes. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1 After these things, the worde of the Lord came vnto Abram in a vision, saying, Feare not, Abram, I am thy buckler, and thine exceeding great reward. 
\v 2 And Abram said, O Lord God, what wilt thou giue me, seeing I goe childlesse, and the steward of mine house is this Eliezer of Damascus? 
\v 3 Againe Abram saide, Beholde, to me thou hast giuen no seede: wherefore loe, a seruant of mine house shalbe mine heire. 
\v 4 Then beholde, the worde of the Lord came vnto him, saying, This man shall not be thine heire, but one that shall come out of thine owne bowels, he shalbe thine heire. 
\v 5 Moreouer he brought him forth and said, Looke vp nowe vnto heauen, and tell ye starres, if thou be able to number them: and he said vnto him, So shall thy seede be. 
\v 6 And Abram beleeued the Lord, and he counted that to him for righteousnesse. 
\v 7 Againe he saide vnto him, I am the Lord, that brought thee out of Vr of the Caldees, to giue thee this land to inherite it. 
\v 8 And he said, O Lord God, whereby shall I knowe that I shall inherite it? 
\v 9 Then he said vnto him, Take me an heifer of three yeeres olde, and a shee goate of three yeeres olde, and a ramme of three yeeres olde, a turtle doue also and a pigeon. 
\v 10 So he tooke all these vnto him, and deuided them into the middes, and laid euery piece one against an other: but the birdes deuided he not. 
\v 11 Then foules fell on the carkases, and Abram droue them away. 
\v 12 And when the sunne went downe, there fell an heauie sleepe vpon Abram: and loe, a very fearefull darkenes fell vpon him. 
\v 13 Then he saide to Abram, Knowe for a suretie, that thy seede shalbe a stranger in a land, that is not theirs, foure hundreth yeeres, and shall serue them: and they shall intreate them euill. 
\v 14 Notwithstanding the nation, whom they shall serue, will I iudge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance. 
\v 15 But thou shalt goe vnto thy fathers in peace, and shalt be buried in a good age. 
\v 16 And in the fourth generation they shall come hither againe: for the wickednes of the Amorites is not yet full. 
\v 17 Also when the sunne went downe, there was a darkenes: and behold, a smoking fornace, and a firebrand, which went betweene those pieces. 
\v 18 In that same day the Lord made a couenant with Abram, saying, Vnto thy seede haue I giuen this lande, from the riuer of Egypt vnto the great riuer, the riuer Euphrates. 
\v 19 The Kenites, and the Kenizites, and the Kadmonites, 
\v 20 And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims, 
\v 21 The Amorites also, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Iebusites. 
\c 16  
\p
\v 1 Nowe Sarai Abrams wife bare him no children, and she had a maide an Egyptian, Hagar by name. 
\v 2 And Sarai said vnto Abram, Beholde now, the Lord hath restrained me from childe bearing. I pray thee goe in vnto my maide: it may be that I shall receiue a childe by her. And Abram obeyed the voyce of Sarai. 
\v 3 Then Sarai Abrams wife tooke Hagar her maide the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelled ten yeere in the land of Canaan, and gaue her to her husband Abram for his wife. 
\v 4 And he went in vnto Hagar, and she conceiued. and when she sawe that she had conceiued, her dame was despised in her eyes. 
\v 5 Then Sarai saide to Abram, Thou doest me wrong. I haue giuen my maide into thy bosome, and she seeth that she hath conceiued, and I am despised in her eyes: the Lord iudge betweene me and thee. 
\v 6 Then Abram saide to Sarai, Beholde, thy maide is in thine hand: doe with her as it pleaseth thee. Then Sarai dealt roughly with her: wherefore she fled from her. 
\v 7 But the Angel of the Lord founde her beside a fountaine of water in the wildernesse by the fountaine in the way to Shur, 
\v 8 And he saide, Hagar Sarais maide, whence commest thou? and whither wilt thou goe? And she said, I flie from my dame Sarai. 
\v 9 Then the Angel of the Lord saide to her, Returne to thy dame, and humble thy selfe vnder her hands. 
\v 10 Againe the Angel of the Lord saide vnto her, I will so greatly increase thy seede, that it shall not be numbred for multitude. 
\v 11 Also the Angel of the Lord said vnto her, See, thou art with childe, and shalt beare a sonne, and shalt call his name Ishmael: for the Lord hath heard thy tribulation. 
\v 12 And he shalbe a wilde man: his hande shall be against euery man, and euery mans hand against him. and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren. 
\v 13 Then she called the name of the Lord, that spake vnto her, Thou God lookest on me: for she said, Haue I not also here looked after him that seeth me? 
\v 14 Wherefore the well was called, Beerlahai-roi. lo, it is betweene Kadesh and Bered. 
\v 15 And Hagar bare Abram a sonne, and Abram called his sonnes name, which Hagar bare, Ishmael. 
\v 16 And Abram was foure score and sixe yeere olde, when Hagar bare him Ishmael. 
\c 17  
\p
\v 1 When Abram was ninetie yeere olde and nine, the Lord appeared to Abram, and said vnto him, I am God all sufficient. walke before me, and be thou vpright, 
\v 2 And I will make my couenant betweene me and thee, and I will multiplie thee exceedingly. 
\v 3 Then Abram fell on his face, and God talked with him, saying, 
\v 4 Beholde, I make my couenant with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations, 
\v 5 Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shalbe Abraham: for a father of many nations haue I made thee. 
\v 6 Also I will make thee exceeding fruitfull, and will make nations of thee: yea, Kings shall proceede of thee. 
\v 7 Moreouer I wil establish my couenant betweene me and thee, and thy seede after thee in their generations, for an euerlasting couenant, to be God vnto thee and to thy seede after thee. 
\v 8 And I will giue thee and thy seede after thee the land, wherein thou art a stranger, euen all the land of Canaan, for an euerlasting possession, and I will be their God. 
\v 9 Againe God said vnto Abraham, Thou also shalt keepe my couenant, thou, and thy seede after thee in their generations. 
\v 10 This is my couenant which ye shall keepe betweene me and you, and thy seede after thee, Let euery man childe among you be circumcised: 
\v 11 That is, ye shall circumcise the foreskin of your flesh, and it shalbe a signe of the couenant betweene me and you. 
\v 12 And euery man childe of eight dayes olde among you, shalbe circumcised in your generations, aswell he that is borne in thine house, as he that is bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seede. 
\v 13 He that is borne in thine house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needes be circumcised: so my couenant shall be in your flesh for an euerlasting couenant. 
\v 14 But the vncircumcised man childe, in whose flesh the foreskin is not circumcised, euen that person shall be cut off from his people, because he hath broken my couenant. 
\v 15 Afterward God said vnto Abraham, Sarai thy wife shalt thou not call Sarai, but Sarah shalbe her name. 
\v 16 And I will blesse her, and will also giue thee a sonne of her, yea, I will blesse her, and she shall be the mother of nations: Kings also of people shall come of her. 
\v 17 Then Abraham fell vpon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a childe be borne vnto him, that is an hundreth yeere olde? and shall Sarah that is ninetie yeere olde beare? 
\v 18 And Abraham saide vnto God, Oh, that Ishmael might liue in thy sight. 
\v 19 Then God saide, Sarah thy wife shall beare thee a sonne in deede, and thou shalt call his name Izhak: and I will establish my couenant with him for an euerlasting couenant, and with his seede after him. 
\v 20 And as concerning Ishmael, I haue heard thee: loe, I haue blessed him, and will make him fruitfull, and will multiplie him exceedingly: twelue princes shall he beget, and I will make a great nation of him. 
\v 21 But my couenant will I establish with Izhak, which Sarah shall beare vnto thee, the next yeere at this season. 
\v 22 And he left off talking with him, and God went vp from Abraham. 
\v 23 Then Abraham tooke Ishmael his sonne and all that were borne in his house, and all that was bought with his money, that is, euery man childe among the men of Abrahams house, and he circumcised the foreskinne of their flesh in that selfe same day, as God had comaunded him. 
\v 24 Abraham also himselfe was ninetie yeere olde and nine, when the foreskinne of his flesh was circumcised. 
\v 25 And Ishmael his sonne was thirteene yeere olde, when the foreskinne of his flesh was circumcised. 
\v 26 The selfe same day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his sonne: 
\v 27 And all the men of his house, both borne in his house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him. 
\c 18  
\p
\v 1 Againe the Lord appeared vnto him in the plaine of Mamre, as he sate in his tent doore about the heate of the day. 
\v 2 And he lift vp his eyes, and looked: and lo, three men stoode by him, and when he sawe them, he ranne to meete them from the tent doore, and bowed himselfe to the grounde. 
\v 3 And he said, Lord, if I haue now founde fauour in thy sight, goe not, I pray thee, from thy seruant. 
\v 4 Let a litle water, I pray you, be brought, and wash your feete, and rest your selues vnder the tree. 
\v 5 And I will bring a morsell of bread, that you may comfort your hearts, afterward ye shall go your wayes: for therefore are ye come to your seruant. And they said, Do euen as thou hast said. 
\v 6 Then Abraham made haste into the tent vnto Sarah, and saide, Make ready at once three measures of fine meale: kneade it, and make cakes vpon the hearth. 
\v 7 And Abraham ranne to the beastes, and tooke a tender and good calfe, and gaue it to the seruant, who hasted to make it ready. 
\v 8 And he tooke butter and milke, and the calfe, which he had prepared, and set before them, and stoode himselfe by them vnder the tree, and they did eate. 
\v 9 Then they saide to him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he answered, Beholde, she is in the tent. 
\v 10 And he saide, I will certainely come againe vnto thee according to ye time of life: and loe, Sarah thy wife shall haue a sonne. and Sarah heard in the tent doore, which was behinde him. 
\v 11 (Nowe Abraham and Sarah were old and striken in age, and it ceased to be with Sarah after the maner of women) 
\v 12 Therefore Sarah laughed within her selfe, saying, After I am waxed olde, and my lord also, shall I haue lust? 
\v 13 And ye Lord saide vnto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah thus laugh, saying, Shall I certainely beare a childe, which am olde? 
\v 14 (Shall any thing be hard to the Lord? at the time appointed will I returne vnto thee, euen according to the time of life, and Sarah shall haue a sonne.) 
\v 15 But Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not: for she was afraide. And he said, It is not so: for thou laughedst. 
\v 16 Afterwarde the men did rise vp from thence and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way. 
\v 17 And the Lord said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I doe, 
\v 18 Seeing that Abraham shalbe in deede a great and a mightie nation, and all the nations of the earth shalbe blessed in him? 
\v 19 For I knowe him that he will commande his sonnes and his houshold after him, that they keepe the way of the Lord, to doe righteousnesse and iudgement, that the Lord may bring vpon Abraham that he hath spoken vnto him. 
\v 20 Then the Lord saide, Because the crie of Sodom and Gomorah is great, and because their sinne is exceeding grieuous, 
\v 21 I will goe downe nowe, and see whether they haue done altogether according to that crie which is come vnto me: and if not, that I may knowe. 
\v 22 And the men turned thence and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stoode yet before the Lord. 
\v 23 Then Abraham drewe neere, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked? 
\v 24 If there be fiftie righteous within the citie, wilt thou destroy and not spare the place for the fiftie righteous that are therein? 
\v 25 Be it farre from thee from doing this thing, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be euen as the wicked, be it farre from thee. shall not the Iudge of all the worlde doe right? 
\v 26 And the Lord answered, If I shall finde in Sodom fiftie righteous within the citie, then will I spare all the place for their sakes. 
\v 27 Then Abraham answered and said, Behold nowe, I haue begun to speake vnto my Lord, and I am but dust and ashes. 
\v 28 If there shall lacke fiue of fiftie righteous, wilt thou destroy all the citie for fiue? And he saide, If I finde there fiue and fourtie, I will not destroy it. 
\v 29 And he yet spake to him againe, and saide, What if there shalbe found fourtie there? Then he answered, I will not doe it for fourties sake. 
\v 30 Againe he said, Let not my Lord nowe be angry, that I speake, What if thirtie be founde there? Then he saide, I will not doe it, if I finde thirtie there. 
\v 31 Moreouer he said, Behold, now I haue begonne to speake vnto my Lord, What if twentie be founde there? And he answered, I will not destroy it for twenties sake. 
\v 32 Then he saide, Let not my Lord be nowe angrie, and I will speake but this once, What if tenne be found there? And he answered, I will not destroy it for tennes sake. 
\v 33 And the Lord went his way when he had left communing with Abraham, and Abraham returned vnto his place. 
\c 19  
\p
\v 1 And in the euening there came two Angels to Sodom: and Lot sate at the gate of Sodom, and Lot sawe them, and rose vp to meete them, and he bowed himselfe with his face to the ground. 
\v 2 And he saide, See my Lords, I pray you turne in nowe into your seruants house, and tarie all night, and wash your feete, and ye shall rise vp early and goe your wayes. Who saide, Nay, but we will abide in the streete all night. 
\v 3 Then he preassed vpon them earnestly, and they turned in to him, and came to his house, and he made them a feast, and did bake vnleauened bread, and they did eate. 
\v 4 But before they went to bed, the men of the citie, euen the men of Sodom compassed the house rounde about from the yong euen to the olde, all the people from all quarters. 
\v 5 Who crying vnto Lot said to him, Where are the men, which came to thee this night? bring them out vnto vs that we may knowe them. 
\v 6 Then Lot went out at the doore vnto them, and shut the doore after him, 
\v 7 And said, I pray you, my brethren, do not so wickedly. 
\v 8 Beholde nowe, I haue two daughters, which haue not knowen man: them will I bring out now vnto you, and doe to them as seemeth you good: onely vnto these men doe nothing: for therefore are they come vnder the shadowe of my roofe. 
\v 9 Then they said, Away hence, and they said, He is come alone as a stranger, and shall he iudge and rule? we will nowe deale worse with thee then with them. So they preassed sore vpon Lot himselfe, and came to breake the doore. 
\v 10 But the men put forth their hand and pulled Lot into the house to them and shut to ye doore. 
\v 11 Then they smote the men that were at the doore of the house with blindnes both small and great, so that they were wearie in seeking the doore. 
\v 12 Then the men said vnto Lot, Whom hast thou yet here? either sonne in lawe, or thy sonnes, or thy daughters, or whatsoeuer thou hast in the citie, bring it out of this place. 
\v 13 For we will destroy this place, because the crye of them is great before the Lord, and the Lord hath sent vs to destroy it. 
\v 14 Then Lot went out and spake vnto his sonnes in lawe, which maried his daughters, and said, Arise, get you out of this place: for the Lord will destroy the citie: but he seemed to his sonnes in lawe as though he had mocked. 
\v 15 And when the morning arose, the Angels hasted Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife and thy two daughters which are here, lest thou be destroyed in the punishment of the citie. 
\v 16 And as he prolonged the time, the men caught both him and his wife, and his two daughters by the hands (the Lord being mercifull vnto him) and they brought him foorth, and set him without the citie. 
\v 17 And when they had brought them out, the Angel said, Escape for thy life: looke not behinde thee, neither tarie thou in all the plaine: escape into ye mountaine, least thou be destroyed. 
\v 18 And Lot saide vnto them, Not so, I pray thee, my Lord. 
\v 19 Behold now, thy seruant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercie, which thou hast shewed vnto me in sauing my life: and I cannot escape in the mountaine, least some euill take me, and I die. 
\v 20 See nowe this citie hereby to flee vnto, which is a litle one: Oh let me escape thither: is it not a litle one, and my soule shall liue? 
\v 21 Then he said vnto him, Beholde, I haue receiued thy request also concerning this thing, that I will not ouerthrow this citie, for the which thou hast spoken. 
\v 22 Haste thee, saue thee there: for I can doe nothing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the citie was called Zoar. 
\v 23 The sunne did rise vpon the earth, when Lot entred into Zoar. 
\v 24 Then the Lord rained vpon Sodom and vpon Gomorah brimstone, and fire from the Lord out of heauen, 
\v 25 And ouerthrewe those cities and all the plaine, and all the inhabitants of the cities; and that that grewe vpon the earth. 
\v 26 Now his wife behind him looked backe, and she became a pillar of salt. 
\v 27 And Abraham rising vp earely in ye morning went to the place, where he had stand before the Lord, 
\v 28 And looking towarde Sodom and Gomorah and toward all the land of the plaine, behold, he sawe the smoke of the lande mounting vp as the smoke of a fornace. 
\v 29 But yet when God destroyed the cities of the plaine, God thought vpon Abraham, and sent Lot out from the middes of the destruction, when he ouerthrewe the cities, wherein Lot dwelled. 
\v 30 Then Lot went vp from Zoar, and dwelt in the mountaine with his two daughters: for he feared to tarie in Zoar, but dwelt in a caue, he, and his two daughters. 
\v 31 And the elder saide vnto the yonger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth, to come in vnto vs after the maner of all ye earth. 
\v 32 Come, wee will make our father drinke wine, and lie with him, that we may preserue seede of our father. 
\v 33 So they made their father drinke wine that night, and the elder went and lay with her father: but he perceiued not, neither whe she lay downe, neither when she rose vp. 
\v 34 And on the morowe the elder saide to the yonger, Behold, yester night lay I with my father: let vs make him drinke wine this night also, and goe thou and lie with him, that we may preserue seede of our father. 
\v 35 So they made their father drinke wine that night also, and the yonger arose, and lay with him, but he perceiued not, when she lay downe, neither when she rose vp. 
\v 36 Thus were both the daughters of Lot with childe by their father. 
\v 37 And the elder bare a sonne, and she called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites vnto this day. 
\v 38 And the yonger bare a sonne also, and she called his name Ben-ammi: the same is the father of the Ammonites vnto this day. 
\c 20  
\p
\v 1 Afterward Abraham departed thence toward the South countrey and dwelled betweene Cadesh and Shur, and soiourned in Gerar. 
\v 2 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister. Then Abimelech King of Gerar sent and tooke Sarah. 
\v 3 But God came to Abimelech in a dreame by night, and said to him, Beholde, thou art but dead, because of the woman, which thou hast taken: for she is a mans wife. 
\v 4 (Notwithstanding Abimelech had not yet come neere her) And he said, Lord, wilt thou slay euen the righteous nation? 
\v 5 Said not he vnto me, She is my sister? yea, and she her selfe said, He is my brother: with an vpright minde, and innocent handes haue I done this. 
\v 6 And God saide vnto him by a dreame, I knowe that thou diddest this euen with an vpright minde, and I kept thee also that thou shouldest not sinne against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touche her. 
\v 7 Now then deliuer the man his wife againe: for he is a Prophet, and he shall pray for thee that thou mayest liue: but if thou deliuer her not againe, be sure that thou shalt die the death, thou, and all that thou hast. 
\v 8 Then Abimelech rising vp early in ye morning, called all his seruants, and tolde all these things vnto them, and the men were sore afraid. 
\v 9 Afterward Abimelech called Abraham, and said vnto him, What hast thou done vnto vs? and what haue I offeded thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdome this great sinne? thou hast done things vnto me that ought not to be done. 
\v 10 So Abimelech said vnto Abraham, What sawest thou that thou hast done this thing? 
\v 11 Then Abraham answered, Because I thought thus, Surely the feare of God is not in this place, and they will slay me for my wiues sake. 
\v 12 Yet in very deede she is my sister: for she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother, and she is my wife. 
\v 13 Nowe when God caused me to wander out of my fathers house, I said then to her, This is thy kindnes that thou shalt shewe vnto me in all places where we come, Say thou of me, He is my brother. 
\v 14 Then tooke Abimelech sheepe and beeues, and men seruants, and women seruants, and gaue them vnto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife. 
\v 15 And Abimelech saide, Beholde, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee. 
\v 16 Likewise to Sarah he said, Beholde, I haue giuen thy brother a thousand pieces of siluer: behold, he is the vaile of thine eyes to all that are with thee, and to all others: and she was thus reproued. 
\v 17 Then Abraham prayed vnto God, and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his women seruants: and they bare children. 
\v 18 For the Lord had shut vp euery wombe of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abrahams wife. 
\c 21  
\p
\v 1 Nowe the Lord visited Sarah, as he had saide, and did vnto her according as he had promised. 
\v 2 For Sarah conceiued, and bare Abraham a sonne in his olde age, at the same season that God tolde him. 
\v 3 And Abraham called his sonnes name that was borne vnto him, which Sarah bare him, Izhak. 
\v 4 Then Abraham circumcised Izhak his sonne, when he was eight dayes olde, as God had commanded him. 
\v 5 So Abraham was an hundreth yeere olde, when his sonne Izhak was borne vnto him. 
\v 6 Then Sarah said, God hath made me to reioyce: all that heare will reioyce with me. 
\v 7 Againe she said, Who would haue saide to Abraham, that Sarah shoulde haue giuen children sucke? for I haue borne him a sonne in his olde age. 
\v 8 Then the childe grewe and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Izhak was weaned. 
\v 9 And Sarah sawe the sonne of Hagar the Egyptian (which she had borne vnto Abraham) mocking. 
\v 10 Wherefore she saide vnto Abraham, Cast out this bond woman and her sonne: for ye sonne of this bonde woman shall not be heire with my sonne Izhak. 
\v 11 And this thing was very grieuous in Abrahams sight, because of his sonne. 
\v 12 But God said vnto Abraham, Let it not be grieuous in thy sight for the childe, and for thy bonde woman: in all that Sarah shall say vnto thee, heare her voyce: for in Izhak shall thy seede be called. 
\v 13 As for the sonne of the bond woman, I will make him a nation also, because he is thy seede. 
\v 14 So Abraham arose vp early in ye morning, and tooke bread, and a bottell of water, and gaue it vnto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the childe also, and sent her away: who departing wandred in the wildernesse of Beer-sheba. 
\v 15 And when the water of the bottell was spent, she cast the childe vnder a certaine tree. 
\v 16 Then she went and sate her ouer against him a farre off about a bowe shoote: for she said, I will not see the death of the child. and she sate downe ouer against him, and lift vp her voyce and wept. 
\v 17 Then God heard the voyce of ye childe, and the Angel of God called to Hagar from heauen, and said vnto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? feare not, for God hath heard the voyce of the childe where he is. 
\v 18 Arise, take vp the childe, and holde him in thine hand: for I will make of him a great people. 
\v 19 And God opened her eyes, and she sawe a well of water. so she went and filled the bottell with water, and gaue the boy drinke. 
\v 20 So God was with the childe, and he grewe and dwelt in the wildernesse, and was an archer. 
\v 21 And he dwelt in the wildernesse of Paran, and his mother tooke him a wife out of the land of Egypt. 
\v 22 And at that same time Abimelech and Phichol his chief captaine spake vnto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest. 
\v 23 Nowe therefore sweare vnto me here by God, that thou wilt not hurt me, nor my children, nor my childrens children: thou shalt deale with me, and with the countrey, where thou hast bene a stranger, according vnto the kindnesse that I haue shewed thee. 
\v 24 Then Abraham said, I will sweare. 
\v 25 And Abraham rebuked Abimelech for a well of water, which Abimelechs seruants had violently taken away. 
\v 26 And Abimelech saide, I knowe not who hath done this thing: also thou toldest me not, neither heard I of it but this day. 
\v 27 Then Abraham tooke sheepe and beeues, and gaue them vnto Abimelech: and they two made a couenant. 
\v 28 And Abraham set seuen lambes of the flocke by themselues. 
\v 29 Then Abimelech said vnto Abraham, What meane these seuen lambes, which thou hast set by themselues? 
\v 30 And he answered, Because thou shalt receiue of mine hand these seuen lambes, that it may be a witnes vnto me, that I haue digged this well. 
\v 31 Wherefore the place is called Beer-sheba, because there they both sware. 
\v 32 Thus made they a couenant at Beer-sheba: afterward Abimelech and Phichol his chiefe captaine rose vp, and turned againe vnto the land of the Philistims. 
\v 33 And Abraham planted a groue in Beer-sheba, and called there on the Name of ye Lord, the euerlasting God. 
\v 34 And Abraham was a stranger in the Philistims land a long season. 
\c 22  
\p
\v 1 And after these things God did proue Abraham, and said vnto him, Abraham. Who answered, Here am I. 
\v 2 And he said, Take nowe thine onely sonne Izhak whom thou louest, and get thee vnto the land of Moriah, and offer him there for a burnt offering vpon one of the mountaines, which I will shewe thee. 
\v 3 Then Abraham rose vp early in the morning, and sadled his asse, and tooke two of his seruants with him, and Izhak his sonne, and cloue wood for the burnt offering, and rose vp and went to the place, which God had tolde him. 
\v 4 Then the third day Abraham lift vp his eyes, and sawe the place afarre off, 
\v 5 And said vnto his seruants, Abide you here with the asse: for I and the childe will go yonder and worship, and come againe vnto you. 
\v 6 Then Abraham tooke the wood of the burnt offering, and layed it vpon Izhak his sonne, and he tooke the fire in his hand, and the knife: and they went both together. 
\v 7 Then spake Izhak vnto Abraham his father, and said, My father. And he answered, Here am I, my sonne. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood, but where is the lambe for ye burnt offring? 
\v 8 Then Abraham answered, My sonne, God will prouide him a lambe for a burnt offering: so they went both together. 
\v 9 And when they came to the place which God had shewed him, Abraham builded an altar there, and couched ye wood, and bound Izhak his sonne and laid him on the altar vpon the wood. 
\v 10 And Abraham stretching forth his hand, tooke the knife to kill his sonne. 
\v 11 But the Angel of the Lord called vnto him from heauen, saying, Abraham, Abraham. And he answered, Here am I. 
\v 12 Then he said, Lay not thine hand vpon the childe, neither doe any thing vnto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing for my sake thou hast not spared thine onely sonne. 
\v 13 And Abraham lifting vp his eyes, looked: and behold, there was a ramme behind him caught by the hornes in a bush. then Abraham went and tooke the ramme, and offered him vp for a burnt offering in the steade of his sonne. 
\v 14 And Abraham called the name of that place, Iehouah-ijreh. as it is said this day, In the mount will the Lord be seene. 
\v 15 And the Angel of the Lord cryed vnto Abraham from heauen the second time, 
\v 16 And saide, By my selfe haue I sworne (saith ye Lord) because thou hast done this thing, and hast not spared thine onely sonne, 
\v 17 Therefore will I surely blesse thee, and will greatly multiplie thy seede, as the starres of the heauen, and as the sand which is vpon the sea shore, and thy seede shall possesse the gate of his enemies. 
\v 18 And in thy seede shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because thou hast obeyed my voyce. 
\v 19 Then turned Abraham againe vnto his seruants, and they rose vp and went together to Beer-sheba: and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba. 
\v 20 And after these things one tolde Abraham, saying, Beholde Milcah, she hath also borne children vnto thy brother Nahor: 
\v 21 To wit, Vz his eldest sonne, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram, 
\v 22 And Chesed and Hazo, and Pildash, and Iidlaph, and Bethuel. 
\v 23 And Bethuel begate Rebekah: these eight did Milcah beare to Nahor Abrahams brother. 
\v 24 And his concubine called Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gahan, and Thahash and Maachah. 
\c 23  
\p
\v 1 When Sarah was an hundreth twentie and seuen yeere olde (so long liued she). 
\v 2 Then Sarah dyed in Kiriath-arba: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan. and Abraham came to mourne for Sarah and to weepe for her. 
\v 3 Then Abraham rose vp from the sight of his corps, and talked with the Hittites, saying, 
\v 4 I am a stranger, and a forreiner among you, giue me a possession of buriall with you, that I may burie my dead out of my sight. 
\v 5 Then the Hittites answered Abraham, saying vnto him, 
\v 6 Heare vs, my lorde: thou art a prince of God among vs: in the chiefest of our sepulchres bury thy dead: none of vs shall forbid thee his sepulchre, but thou mayest bury thy dead therein. 
\v 7 Then Abraham stoode vp, and bowed him selfe before the people of the land of the Hittites. 
\v 8 And he communed with them, saying, If it be your minde, that I shall bury my dead out of my sight, heare me, and intreate for me to Ephron the sonne of Zohar, 
\v 9 That he would giue me ye caue of Machpelah, which he hath in the ende of his field: that he would giue it me for as much money as it is worth, for a possession to bury in among you. 
\v 10 (For Ephron dwelt among the Hittites) Then Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of all the Hittites that went in at the gates of his citie, saying, 
\v 11 No, my Lord, heare me: the fielde giue I thee, and the caue, that therein is, I giue it thee: euen in the presence of the sonnes of my people giue I it thee, to bury thy dead. 
\v 12 Then Abraham bowed himselfe before the people of the land, 
\v 13 And spake vnto Ephron in the audience of the people of the countrey, saying, Seeing thou wilt giue it, I pray thee, heare me, I will giue the price of the fielde: receiue it of me, and I will bury my dead there. 
\v 14 Ephron then answered Abraham, saying vnto him, 
\v 15 My lord, hearken vnto me: ye land is worth foure hundreth shekels of siluer: what is that betweene me and thee? bury therefore thy dead. 
\v 16 So Abraham hearkened vnto Ephron, and Abraham weyed to Ephron the siluer, which he had named, in the audience of the Hittites, euen foure hundreth siluer shekels of currant money among marchants. 
\v 17 So the fielde of Ephron which was in Machpelah, and ouer against Mamre, euen the field and the caue that was therein, and all the trees that were in the fielde, which were in all the borders round about, was made sure 
\v 18 Vnto Abraham for a possession, in ye sight of the Hittites, euen of all that went in at the gates of his citie. 
\v 19 And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the caue of the fielde of Machpelah ouer against Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan. 
\v 20 Thus the fielde and the caue, that is therein, was made sure vnto Abraham for a possession of buriall by the Hittites. 
\c 24  
\p
\v 1 Nowe Abraham was olde, and striken in yeeres, and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things. 
\v 2 Therefore Abraham saide vnto his eldest seruant of his house, which had the rule ouer all that he had, Put nowe thine hand vnder my thigh, 
\v 3 And I will make thee sweare by ye Lord God of the heauen, and God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife vnto my sonne of the daughters of the Canaanites among who I dwel. 
\v 4 But thou shalt go vnto my countrey, and to my kinred, and take a wife vnto my sone Izhak. 
\v 5 And the seruant saide to him, What if the woman will not come with me to this land? shall I bring thy sonne againe vnto the lande from whence thou camest? 
\v 6 To whom Abraham answered, Beware that thou bring not my sonne thither againe. 
\v 7 The Lord God of heauen, who tooke me from my fathers house, and from the land where I was borne, and that spake vnto me, and that sware vnto me, saying, Vnto thy seede wil I giue this land, he shall send his Angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife vnto my sonne from thence. 
\v 8 Neuertheles if the woman wil not follow thee, then shalt thou bee discharged of this mine othe: onely bring not my sonne thither againe. 
\v 9 Then the seruant put his hand vnder the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him for this matter. 
\v 10 So the seruant tooke ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed: (for he had all his masters goods in his hand:) and so he arose, and went to Aram Naharaim, vnto the citie of Nahor. 
\v 11 And he made his camels to lye downe without the citie by a well of water, at euentide about the time that the women come out to draw water. 
\v 12 And he said, O Lord God of my master Abraham, I beseech thee, send me good speede this day, and shew mercy vnto my master Abraham. 
\v 13 Lo, I stand by the well of water, whiles the mens daughters of this citie come out to drawe water. 
\v 14 Graunt therefore that ye maide, to whom I say, Bowe downe thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drinke: if she say, Drinke, and I will giue thy camels drinke also: may be she that thou hast ordeined for thy seruant Izhak: and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed mercy on my master. 
\v 15 And nowe yer he had left speaking, beholde, Rebekah came out, the daughter of Bethuel, sonne of Milcah the wife of Nahor Abrahams brother, and her pitcher vpon her shoulder. 
\v 16 (And the maide was very faire to looke vpon, a virgine and vnknowen of man) and she went downe to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came vp. 
\v 17 Then the seruant ranne to meete her, and said, Let me drinke, I pray thee, a litle water of thy pitcher. 
\v 18 And she said, Drinke sir: and she hasted, and let downe her pitcher vpon her hand and gaue him drinke. 
\v 19 And when she had giuen him drinke, she said, I will drawe water for thy camels also vntill they haue drunken inough. 
\v 20 And she powred out her pitcher into the trough speedily; and ranne againe vnto the well to drawe water, and she drewe for all his camels. 
\v 21 So the man wondred at her, and helde his peace, to knowe whether the Lord had made his iourney prosperous or not. 
\v 22 And when the camels had left drinking, the man tooke a golden abillement of halfe a shekell weight, and two bracelets for her hands, of ten shekels weight of golde: 
\v 23 And he said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee, Is there roume in thy fathers house for vs to lodge in? 
\v 24 Then she said to him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the sonne of Milcah whom she bare vnto Nahor. 
\v 25 Moreouer she said vnto him, We haue litter also and prouender ynough, and roume to lodge in. 
\v 26 And the man bowed himselfe and worshipped the Lord, 
\v 27 And said, Blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham, which hath not withdrawen his mercie and his trueth from my master: for when I was in the way, the Lord brought me to my masters brethrens house. 
\v 28 And the maide ranne and tolde them of her mothers house according to these wordes. 
\v 29 Now Rebekah had a brother called Laban, and Laban ranne vnto the man to the well. 
\v 30 For when he had seene the earings and the bracelets in his sisters hands, and when he heard the wordes of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus said the man vnto me, then he went to the man, and loe, he stoode by the camels at the well. 
\v 31 And he saide, Come in thou blessed of the Lord: wherefore standest thou without, seeing I haue prepared the house, and roume for ye camels? 
\v 32 Then the man came into the house, and he vnsadled the camels, and brought litter and prouender for the camels, and water to wash his feete, and the mens feete that were with him. 
\v 33 Afterward the meate was set before him: but he saide, I will not eate, vntill I haue saide my message: And he said, Speake on. 
\v 34 Then he said, I am Abrahams seruant, 
\v 35 And the Lord hath blessed my master wonderfully, that he is become great: for he hath giuen him sheepe, and beeues, and siluer, and golde, and men seruants, and maide seruants, and camels, and asses. 
\v 36 And Sarah my masters wife hath borne a sonne to my master, when she was olde, and vnto him hath he giuen all that he hath. 
\v 37 Now my master made me sweare, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my sonne of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell: 
\v 38 But thou shalt go vnto my fathers house and to my kinred, and take a wife vnto my sonne. 
\v 39 Then I saide vnto my master, What if the woman will not follow me? 
\v 40 Who answered me, The Lord, before who I walke, will send his Angel with thee, and prosper thy iourney, and thou shalt take a wife for my sonne of my kinred and my fathers house. 
\v 41 Then shalt thou be discharged of mine othe, when thou commest to my kinred: and if they giue thee not one, thou shalt be free from mine othe. 
\v 42 So I came this day to the well, and said, O Lord, the God of my master Abraham, if thou nowe prosper my iourney which I goe, 
\v 43 Behold, I stand by the well of water: when a virgine commeth forth to drawe water, and I say to her, Giue me, I pray thee, a litle water of thy pitcher to drinke, 
\v 44 And she say to me, Drinke thou, and I will also drawe for thy camels, let her be ye wife, which the Lord hath prepared for my masters sonne. 
\v 45 And before I had made an end of speaking in mine heart, beholde, Rebekah came foorth, and her pitcher on her shoulder, and she went downe vnto the well, and drewe water. Then I said vnto her, Giue me drinke, I pray thee. 
\v 46 And she made haste, and tooke downe her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drinke, and I will giue thy camels drinke also. So I dranke, and she gaue the camels drinke also. 
\v 47 Then I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she answered, The daughter of Bethuel Nahors sonne, whom Milcah bare vnto him. Then I put the abillement vpon her face, and the bracelets vpon her hands: 
\v 48 And I bowed downe and worshipped the Lord, and blessed the Lord God of my master Abraham, which had brought me the right way to take my masters brothers daughter vnto his sone. 
\v 49 Now therefore, if ye will deale mercifully and truely with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me that I may turne me to the right hand or to the left. 
\v 50 Then answered Laban and Bethuel, and said, This thing is proceeded of the Lord: we cannot therefore say vnto thee, neither euill nor good. 
\v 51 Beholde, Rebehak is before thee, take her and goe, that she may be thy masters sonnes wife, euen as the Lord hath said. 
\v 52 And when Abrahams seruant heard their wordes, he bowed himselfe toward the earth vnto the Lord. 
\v 53 Then the seruant tooke foorth iewels of siluer, and iewels of golde, and raiment, and gaue to Rebekah: also vnto her brother and to her mother he gaue gifts. 
\v 54 Afterward they did eate and drinke, both he, and the men that were with him, and taried all night. and when they rose vp in the morning, he said, Let me depart vnto my master. 
\v 55 Then her brother and her mother answered, Let the maide abide with vs, at the least ten dayes: then shall she goe. 
\v 56 But he said vnto them, Hinder you me not, seeing the Lord hath prospered my iourney: send me away, that I may goe to my master. 
\v 57 Then they said, We will call the maide, and aske her consent. 
\v 58 And they called Rebekah, and saide vnto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she answered, I will go. 
\v 59 So they let Rebekah their sister goe, and her nourse, with Abrahams seruant and his men. 
\v 60 And they blessed Rebekah, and sayde vnto her, Thou art our sister, growe into thousande thousands, and thy seede possesse the gate of his enemies. 
\v 61 Then Rebekah arose, and her maydes, and rode vpon the camels, and followed the man. and the seruant tooke Rebekah, and departed. 
\v 62 Nowe Izhak came from the way of Beer-lahai-roi, (for he dwelt in the South countrey) 
\v 63 And Izhak went out. to pray in the fielde toward the euening: who lift vp his eyes and looked, and behold, the camels came. 
\v 64 Also Rebekah lift vp her eyes, and when she saw Izhak, she lighted downe from the camel. 
\v 65 (For shee had sayde to the seruant, Who is yonder man, that commeth in the fielde to meete vs? and the seruant had said, It is my master) So she tooke a vaile, and couered her. 
\v 66 And the seruant tolde Izhak all things, that he had done. 
\v 67 Afterward Izhak brought her into the tent of Sarah his mother, and he tooke Rebekah, and she was his wife, and he loued her: So Izhak was comforted after his mothers death. 
\c 25  
\p
\v 1 Nowe Abraham had taken him another wife called Keturah, 
\v 2 Which bare him Zimran, and Iokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah. 
\v 3 And Iokshan begate Sheba, and Dedan: And the sonnes of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim. 
\v 4 Also the sonnes of Midian were Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah all these were the sonnes of Keturah. 
\v 5 And Abraham gaue all his goods to Izhak, 
\v 6 But vnto the sonnes of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gaue giftes, and sent them away from Izhak his sonne (while he yet liued) Eastward to the East countrey. 
\v 7 And this is the age of Abrahams life, which he liued, an hundreth seuentie and fiue yeere. 
\v 8 Then Abraham yeelded the spirit, and died in a good age, an olde man, and of great yeeres, and was gathered to his people. 
\v 9 And his sonnes, Izhak and Ishmael buryed him in the caue of Machpelah, in the fielde of Ephron sonne of Zohar the Hittite, before Mamre. 
\v 10 Which fielde Abraham bought of the Hittites, where Abraham was buryed with Sarah his wife. 
\v 11 And after the death of Abraham God blessed Izhak his sonne, and Izhak dwelt by Beer-lahai-roi. 
\v 12 Nowe these are the generations of Ishmael Abrahams sonne, whome Hagar the Egyptian Sarahs handmayde bare vnto Abraham. 
\v 13 And these are the names of the sonnes of Ishmael, name by name, according to their kinreds; the eldest sonne of Ishmael was Nebaioth, then Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam, 
\v 14 And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa, 
\v 15 Hadar, and Tema, Ietur, Naphish, and Kedemah. 
\v 16 These are the sonnes of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their townes and by their castles: to wit, twelue princes of their nations. 
\v 17 (And these are the yeeres of the life of Ishmael, an hundreth thirtie and seuen yeere, and he yeelded the spirit, and dyed, and was gathered vnto his people) 
\v 18 And they dwelt from Hauilah vnto Shur, that is towardes Egypt, as thou goest to Asshur. Ishmael dwelt in the presence of all his brethren. 
\v 19 Likewise these are the generations of Izhak Abrahams sonne Abraham begate Izhak, 
\v 20 And Izhak was fourtie yeere olde, when he tooke Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramite of Padan Aram, and sister to Laban the Aramite. 
\v 21 And Izhak prayed vuto the Lord for his wife, because she was barren: and the Lord was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceiued, 
\v 22 But the children stroue together within her: therefore shee sayde, Seeing it is so, why am I thus? wherefore she went to aske the Lord. 
\v 23 And the Lord sayd to her, Two nations are in thy wombe, and two maner of people shalbe diuided out of thy bowels, and the one people shall be mightier then the other, and the elder shall serue the yonger. 
\v 24 Therefore when her time of deliuerance was fulfilled, behold, twinnes were in her wombe. 
\v 25 So he that came out first was red, and he was all ouer as a rough garment, and they called his name Esau. 
\v 26 And afterward came his brother out, and his hande helde Esau by the heele: therefore his name was called Iaakob. Nowe Izhak was threescore yeere olde when Rebekah bare them. 
\v 27 And the boyes grew, and Esau was a cunning hunter, and liued in the fields: but Iaakob was a plaine man, and dwelt in tentes. 
\v 28 And Izhak loued Esau, for venison was his meate, but Rebekah loued Iaakob. 
\v 29 Nowe Iaakob sod pottage, and Esau came from the fielde and was wearie. 
\v 30 Then Esau sayd to Iaakob, Let me eate, I pray thee, of that pottage so red, for I am wearie. Therefore was his name called Edom. 
\v 31 And Iaakob sayd, Sell me euen nowe thy birthright. 
\v 32 And Esau sayd, Lo, I am almost dead, what is then this birthright to me? 
\v 33 Iaakob then said, Sweare to me euen now. And he sware to him, and solde his birthright vnto Iaakob. 
\v 34 Then Iaakob gaue Esau bread and pottage of lentiles: and he did eate and drinke, and rose vp, and went his way: So Esau contemned his birthright. 
\c 26  
\p
\v 1 And there was a famine in the lande besides the first famine that was in the dayes of Abraham. Wherefore Izhak went to Abimelech King of the Philistims vnto Gerar. 
\v 2 For the Lord appeared vnto him, and sayde, Goe not downe into Egypt, but abide in the land which I shall shewe vnto thee. 
\v 3 Dwell in this lande, and I will be with thee, and will blesse thee: for to thee, and to thy seede I will giue all these countreys: and I will performe the othe which I sware vnto Abraham thy father. 
\v 4 Also I wil cause thy seede to multiply as the starres of heauen, and will giue vnto thy seede all these countreys: and in thy seede shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, 
\v 5 Because that Abraham obeyed my voyce and kept mine ordinance, my commandements, my statutes, and my Lawes. 
\v 6 So Izhak dwelt in Gerar. 
\v 7 And the men of the place asked him of his wife, and he sayd, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife, least, sayde he, the men of the place shoulde kill me, because of Rebekah: for she was beautifull to the eye. 
\v 8 So after hee had bene there long time, Abimelech King of the Philistims looked out at a windowe, and loe, he sawe Izhak sporting with Rebekah his wife. 
\v 9 Then Abimelech called Izhak, and sayde, Loe, shee is of a suertie thy wife, and why saydest thou, She is my sister? To whom Izhak answered, Because I thought this, It may be that I shall dye for her. 
\v 10 Then Abimelech said, Why hast thou done this vnto vs? one of the people had almost lien by thy wife, so shouldest thou haue brought sinne vpon vs. 
\v 11 Then Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man, or his wife, shall die the death. 
\v 12 Afterwarde Izhak sowed in that lande, and founde in the same yeere an hundreth folde by estimation: and so the Lord blessed him. 
\v 13 And the man waxed mightie, and stil increased, till he was exceeding great, 
\v 14 For he had flockes of sheepe, and heards of cattell, and a mightie housholde: therefore the Philistims had enuy at him. 
\v 15 In so much that the Philistims stopped and filled vp with earth all the welles, which his fathers seruantes digged in his father Abrahams time. 
\v 16 Then Abimelech sayde vnto Izhak, Get thee from vs, for thou art mightier then wee a great deale. 
\v 17 Therefore Izhak departed thence and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there. 
\v 18 And Izhak returning, digged the welles of water, which they had digged in the dayes of Abraham his father: for the Philistims had stopped them after the death of Abraham, and hee gaue them the same names, which his father gaue them. 
\v 19 Izhaks seruantes then digged in the valley, and found there a well of liuing water. 
\v 20 But the herdmen of Gerar did striue with Izhaks herdmen, saying, The water is ours: therefore called he the name of the well Esek, because they were at strife with him. 
\v 21 Afterwarde they digged another well, and stroue for that also, and he called the name of it Sitnah. 
\v 22 Then he remoued thence, and digged an other well, for the which they stroue not: therefore called hee the name of it Rehoboth, and sayde, Because the Lord hath nowe made vs roome, we shall increase vpon the earth. 
\v 23 So he went vp thence to Beer-sheba. 
\v 24 And the Lord appeared vnto him the same night, and sayde, I am the God of Abraham thy father: feare not, for I am with thee, and wil blesse thee, and will multiplie thy seede for my seruant Abrahams sake. 
\v 25 Then he builte an altar there, and called vpon the Name of the Lord, and there spred his tent: where also Izhaks seruauntes digged a well. 
\v 26 Then came Abimelech to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friendes, and Phichol the captaine of his armie. 
\v 27 To whom Izhak sayd, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate mee and haue put mee away from you? 
\v 28 Who answered, Wee sawe certainely that the Lord was with thee, and wee thought thus, Let there be nowe an othe betweene vs, euen betweene vs and thee, and let vs make a couenant with thee. 
\v 29 If thou shalt do vs no hurt, as we haue not touched thee, and as we haue done vnto thee nothing but good, and sent thee away in peace: thou nowe, the blessed of the Lord, doe this. 
\v 30 Then hee made them a feast, and they dyd eate and drinke. 
\v 31 And they rose vp betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: then Izhak let them go, and they departed from him in peace. 
\v 32 And that same day Izhaks seruantes came and tolde him of a well, which they had digged, and said vnto him, We haue found water. 
\v 33 So hee called it Shibah: therefore the name of the citie is called Beer-sheba vnto this day. 
\v 34 Nowe when Esau was fourtie yeere olde, he tooke to wife Iudith, the daughter of Beeri an Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon an Hittite also. 
\v 35 And they were a griefe of minde to Izhak and to Rebekah. 
\c 27  
\p
\v 1 And when Izhak was olde, and his eyes were dimme (so that he coulde not see) he called Esau his eldest sonne, and sayde vnto him, My sonne. And he answered him, I am here. 
\v 2 Then he sayd, Beholde, I am nowe olde, and knowe not the day of my death: 
\v 3 Wherefore nowe, I pray thee take thine instruments, thy quiuer and thy bowe, and get thee to the fielde, that thou mayest take mee some venison. 
\v 4 Then make mee sauourie meate, such as I loue, and bring it me that I may eat, and that my soule may blesse thee, before I die. 
\v 5 (Nowe Rebekah heard, when Izhak spake to Esau his sonne) and Esau went into the fielde to hunt for venison, and to bring it. 
\v 6 Then Rebekah spake vnto Iaakob her sonne, saying, Beholde, I haue heard thy father talking with Esau thy brother, saying, 
\v 7 Bring mee vension, and make mee sauourie meate, that I may eate and blesse thee before the Lord, afore my death. 
\v 8 Nowe therefore, my sonne, heare my voyce in that which I command thee. 
\v 9 Get thee nowe to the flocke, and bring me thence two good kids of the goates, that I may make pleasant meate of them for thy father, such as he loueth. 
\v 10 Then shalt thou bring it to thy father, and he shall eate, to the intent that he may blesse thee before his death. 
\v 11 But Iaakob sayde to Rebekah his mother, Beholde, Esau my brother is rough, and I am smoothe. 
\v 12 My father may possibly feele me, and I shall seem to him to be a mocker: so shall I bring a curse vpon me, and not a blessing. 
\v 13 But his mother sayd vnto him, vpon me be thy curse, my sonne: onely heare my voyce, and go and bring me them. 
\v 14 So he went and set them, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made pleasant meat, such as his father loued. 
\v 15 And Rebekah tooke faire clothes of her elder sonne Esau, which were in her house, and clothed Iaakob her yonger sonne: 
\v 16 And she couered his hands and the smoothe of his necke with the skinnes of the kiddes of the goates. 
\v 17 Afterward she put the pleasant meate and bread, which she had prepared, in the hand of her sonne Iaakob. 
\v 18 And when he came to his father, he sayd, My father. Who answered, I am here: who art thou, my sonne? 
\v 19 And Iaakob sayde to his father, I am Esau thy first borne, I haue done as thou badest me, arise, I pray thee: sit vp and eate of my venison, that thy soule may blesse me. 
\v 20 Then Izhak said vnto his sonne, Howe hast thou founde it so quickly my sonne? Who sayde, Because the Lord thy God brought it to mine hande. 
\v 21 Againe sayde Izhak vnto Iaakob, Come neere nowe, that I may feele thee, my sonne, whether thou be that my sonne Esau or not. 
\v 22 Then Iaakob came neere to Izhak his father, and he felt him and sayd, The voyce is Iaakobs voyce, but the hands are the hands of Esau. 
\v 23 (For he knewe him not, because his hands were rough as his brother Esaus hands: wherefore he blessed him) 
\v 24 Againe he sayd, Art thou that my sonne Esau? Who answered, Yea. 
\v 25 Then said he, Bring it me hither, and I will eate of my sonnes venison, that my soule may blesse thee. And he brought it to him, and he ate: also he brought him wine, and he dranke. 
\v 26 Afterward his father Izhak sayd vnto him, Come neere nowe, and kisse me, my sonne. 
\v 27 And hee came neere and kissed him. Then he smellled the sauour of his garmentes, and blessed him, and sayde, Behold, the smelll of my sonne is as the smelll of a fielde, which the Lord hath blessed. 
\v 28 God giue thee therefore of the dewe of heauen, and the fatnesse of the earth, and plentie of wheate and wine. 
\v 29 Let people bee thy seruantes, and nations bowe vnto thee: be Lord ouer thy brethren, and let thy mothers children honour thee. cursed be he that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee. 
\v 30 And when Izhak had made an ende of blessing Iaakob, and Iaakob was scarce gone out from the presence of Izhak his father, then came Esau his brother from his hunting, 
\v 31 And hee also prepared sauourie meate and brought it to his father, and sayd vnto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his sonnes venison, that thy soule may blesse me. 
\v 32 But his father Izhak sayde vnto him, Who art thou? And he answered, I am thy sonne, euen thy first borne Esau. 
\v 33 Then Izhak was stricken with a marueilous great feare, and sayde, Who and where is hee that hunted venison, and brought it mee, and I haue eate of all before thou camest? and I haue blessed him, therefore he shalbe blessed. 
\v 34 When Esau heard the wordes of his father, he cryed out with a great crye and bitter, out of measure, and sayde vnto his father, Blesse me, euen me also, my father. 
\v 35 Who answered, Thy brother came with subtiltie, and hath taken away thy blessing. 
\v 36 Then he sayde, Was hee not iustly called Iaakob? for hee hath deceiued mee these two times: he tooke my birthright, and loe, nowe hath he taken my blessing. Also he sayd, Hast thou not reserued a blessing for me? 
\v 37 Then Izhak answered, and sayd vnto Esau, Beholde, I haue made him thy lorde, and all his brethre haue I made his seruants: also with wheate and wine haue I furnished him, and vnto thee now what shall I doe, my sonne? 
\v 38 Then Esau sayde vnto his father, Hast thou but one blessing my father? blesse mee, euen me also, my father: and Esau lifted vp his voyce, and wept. 
\v 39 Then Izhak his father answered, and sayde vnto him, Behold, the fatnesse of the earth shall be thy dwelling place, and thou shalt haue of the dewe of heauen from aboue. 
\v 40 And by thy sword shalt thou liue, and shalt be thy brothers seruant. But it shall come to passe, when thou shalt get the masterie, that thou shalt breake his yoke from thy necke. 
\v 41 Therefore Esau hated Iaakob, because of the blessing, wherewith his father blessed him. And Esau thought in his minde, The dayes of mourning for my father will come shortly, then I will slay may brother Iaakob. 
\v 42 And it was told to Rebekah of the wordes of Esau her elder sonne, and shee sent and called Iaakob her yonger sonne, and sayd vnto him, Beholde, thy brother Esau is comforted against thee, meaning to kill thee: 
\v 43 Now therefore my sonne, heare my voyce, arise, and flee thou to Haran to my brother Laban, 
\v 44 And tarie with him a while vntill thy brothers fiercenesse be swaged, 
\v 45 And till thy brothers wrath turne away from thee, and hee forget the thinges, which thou hast done to him: then will I sende and take thee from thence: why shoulde I bee depriued of you both in one day? 
\v 46 Also Rebekah said to Izhak, I am weary of my life, for the daughters of Heth. If Iaakob take a wife of the daughters of Heth like these of the daughters of the lande, what auaileth it me to liue? 
\c 28  
\p
\v 1 Then Izhak called Iaakob and blessed him, and charged him, and sayde vnto him, Take not a wife of the daughters of Canaan. 
\v 2 Arise, get thee to Padan Aram to the house of Bethuel thy mothers father, and thence take thee a wife of the daughters of Laban thy mothers brother. 
\v 3 And God all sufficient blesse thee, and make thee to encrease, and multiplie thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people, 
\v 4 And giue thee the blessing of Abraham, euen to thee and to thy seede with thee, that thou mayest inherite the lande (wherein thou art a stranger,) which God gaue vnto Abraham. 
\v 5 Thus Izhak sent forth Iaakob, and he went to Padan Aram vnto Laban sonne of Bethuel the Aramite, brother to Rebekah, Iaakobs and Esaus mother. 
\v 6 When Esau sawe that Izhak had blessed Iaakob, and sent him to Padan Aram, to set him a wife thence, and giuen him a charge when he blessed him, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan, 
\v 7 And that Iaakob had obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Padan Aram: 
\v 8 Also Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan displeased Izhak his father, 
\v 9 Then went Esau to Ishmael, and tooke vnto the wiues, which he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abrahams sonne, the sister of Nabaioth, to be his wife. 
\v 10 Now Iaakob departed from Beer-sheba, and went to Haran, 
\v 11 And he came vnto a certaine place, and taried there al night, because the sunne was downe, and tooke of the stones of the place, and layde vnder his head and slept in the same place. 
\v 12 Then he dreamed, and behold, there stoode a ladder vpon the earth, and the top of it reached vp to heauen: and loe, the Angels of God went vp and downe by it. 
\v 13 And behold, the Lord stoode aboue it, and sayd, I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Izhak: the land, vpon the which thou sleepest, wil I giue thee and thy seede. 
\v 14 And thy seede shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the West, and to the East, and to the North, and to the South, and in thee and in thy seede shall all the families of the earth be blessed. 
\v 15 And lo, I am with thee, and wil keepe thee whithersoeuer thou goest, and will bring thee againe into this lande: for I will not forsake thee vntill I haue performed that, that I haue promised thee. 
\v 16 Then Iaakob awoke out of his sleepe, and sayde, Surely the Lord is in this place, and I was not aware. 
\v 17 And he was afraid, and said, How fearefull is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heauen. 
\v 18 Then Iaakob rose vp early in the morning, and tooke the stone that hee had layde vnder his head, and set it vp as a pillar, and powred oyle vpon the top of it. 
\v 19 And he called ye name of that place Bethel: notwithstanding the name of the citie was at the first called Luz. 
\v 20 Then Iaakob vowed a vowe, saying, If God will be with me, and will keepe me in this iourney which I go, and wil giue me bread to eate, and clothes to put on: 
\v 21 So that I come againe vnto my fathers house in safetie, then shall the Lord be my God. 
\v 22 And this stone, which I haue set vp as a pillar, shall be Gods house: and of all that thou shalt giue me, wil I giue the tenth vnto thee. 
\c 29  
\p
\v 1 Then Iaakob lift vp his feete and came into the East countrey. 
\v 2 And as he looked about, behold there was a well in the field, and lo, three flocks of sheepe lay thereby (for at that well were the flockes watered) and there was a great stone vpon the welles mouth. 
\v 3 And thither were all the flockes gathered, and they rolled the stone from the welles mouth, and watered the sheepe, and put the stone againe vpon the welles mouth in his place. 
\v 4 And Iaakob sayde vnto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they answered, We are of Haran. 
\v 5 Then he sayd vnto them, Know ye Laban the sonne of Nahor? Who said, We know him. 
\v 6 Againe he sayd vnto them, Is he in good health? And they answered, He is in good health, and beholde, his daughter Rahel commeth with the sheepe. 
\v 7 Then he sayd, Lo, it is yet hie day, neither is it time that the cattell shoulde be gathered together: water ye the sheepe and go feede them. 
\v 8 But they sayde, We may not vntill all the flocks be brought together, and till men rolle the stone from the welles mouth, that we may water the sheepe. 
\v 9 While he talked with them, Rahel also came with her fathers sheepe, for she kept them. 
\v 10 And assoone as Iaakob saw Rahel ye daughter of Laban his mothers brother, and the sheepe of Laban his mothers brother, then came Iaakob neere, and rolled the stone from the welles mouth, and watered ye flocke of Laban his mothers brother. 
\v 11 And Iaakob kissed Rahel, and lift vp his voyce and wept. 
\v 12 (For Iaakob tolde Rahel, that he was her fathers brother, and that he was Rebekahs sonne) then she ranne and tolde her father. 
\v 13 And when Laban heard tell of Iaakob his sisters sonne, he ranne to meete him, and embraced him and kissed him, and brought him to his house: and he tolde Laban all these things. 
\v 14 To whome Laban sayd, Well, thou art my bone and my flesh. and he abode with him the space of a moneth. 
\v 15 For Laban sayde vnto Iaakob, Though thou be my brother, shouldest thou therfore serue me for nought? tell me, what shalbe thy wages? 
\v 16 Now Laban had two daughters, the elder called Leah, and the yonger called Rahel. 
\v 17 And Leah was tender eyed, but Rahel was beautifull and faire. 
\v 18 And Iaakob loued Rahel, and sayde, I will serue thee seuen yeeres for Rahel thy yonger daughter. 
\v 19 Then Laban answered, It is better that I giue her thee, then that I should giue her to another man: abide with me. 
\v 20 And Iaakob serued seuen yeres for Rahel, and they seemed vnto him but a few dayes, because he loued her. 
\v 21 Then Iaakob sayde to Laban, Giue me my wife, that I may goe in to her: for my terme is ended. 
\v 22 Wherefore Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast. 
\v 23 But whe the euening was come, he tooke Leah his daughter and brought her to him, and he went in vnto her. 
\v 24 And Laban gaue his mayde Zilpah to his daughter Leah, to be her seruant. 
\v 25 But when the morning was come, behold, it was Leah. Then sayde he to Laban, Wherefore hast thou done thus to mee? did not I serue thee for Rahel? wherfore then hast thou beguiled me? 
\v 26 And Laban answered, It is not the maner of this place, to giue the yonger before the elder. 
\v 27 Fulfill seuen yeeres for her, and we wil also giue thee this for the seruice, which thou shalt serue me yet seuen yeeres more. 
\v 28 Then Iaakob did so, and fulfilled her seuen yeeres, so he gaue him Rahel his daughter to be his wife. 
\v 29 Laban also gaue to Rahel his daughter Bilhah his mayde to be her seruant. 
\v 30 So entred he in to Rahel also, and loued also Rahel more then Leah, and serued him yet seuen yeeres more. 
\v 31 When the Lord saw that Leah was despised, he made her fruitful: but Rahel was barren. 
\v 32 And Leah conceiued and bare a sonne, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Because the Lord hath looked vpon my tribulation, now therefore mine husband will loue me. 
\v 33 And she conceiued againe and bare a sonne, and sayde, Because the Lord heard that I was hated, he hath therefore giuen me this sonne also, and she called his name Simeon. 
\v 34 And she conceiued againe and bare a sonne, and said, Now at this time wil my husband keepe mee company, because I haue borne him three sonnes: therefore was his name called Leui. 
\v 35 Moreouer shee conceiued againe and bare a sonne, saying, Nowe will I prayse the Lord: therefore shee called his name Iudah, and left bearing. 
\c 30  
\p
\v 1 And when Rahel saw that she bare Iaakob no children, Rahel enuied her sister, and said vnto Iaakob, Giue me children, or els I dye. 
\v 2 Then Iaakobs anger was kindled against Rahel, and he sayde, Am I in Gods steade, which hath withholden from thee the fruite of the wombe? 
\v 3 And she said, Behold my maide Bilhah, goe in to her, and she shall beare vpon my knees, and I shall haue children also by her. 
\v 4 Then shee gaue him Bilhah her mayde to wife, and Iaakob went in to her. 
\v 5 So Bilhah conceiued and bare Iaakob a sonne. 
\v 6 Then said Rahel, God hath giuen sentence on my side, and hath also heard my voyce, and hath giuen mee a sonne: therefore called shee his name, Dan. 
\v 7 And Bilhah Rahels maide coceiued againe, and bare Iaakob the second sonne. 
\v 8 Then Rahel said, with excellent wrestlings haue I wrestled with my sister, and haue gotten the vpper hande: and shee called his name, Naphtali. 
\v 9 And when Leah saw that she had left bearing, shee tooke Zilpah her mayde, and gaue her Iaakob to wife. 
\v 10 And Zilpah Leahs mayde bare Iaakob a sonne. 
\v 11 Then sayd Leah, A companie commeth: and she called his name, Gad. 
\v 12 Againe Zilpah Leahs mayde bare Iaakob another sonne. 
\v 13 Then sayde Leah, Ah, blessed am I, for the daughters will blesse me. and she called his name, Asher. 
\v 14 Nowe Reuben went in the dayes of the wheateharuest, and founde mandrakes in the fielde and brought them vnto his mother Leah. Then sayde Rahel to Leah, Giue me, I pray thee, of thy sonnes mandrakes. 
\v 15 But shee answered her, Is it a small matter for thee to take mine husband, except thou take my sonnes mandrakes also? Then sayde Rahel, Therefore he shall sleepe with thee this night for thy sonnes mandrakes. 
\v 16 And Iaakob came from the fielde in the euening, and Leah went out to meete him, and sayde, Come in to mee, for I haue bought and payed for thee with my sonnes mandrakes: and he slept with her that night. 
\v 17 And God heard Leah and shee conceiued, and bare vnto Iaakob the fift sonne. 
\v 18 Then said Leah, God hath giuen me my reward, because I gaue my mayde to my husband, and she called his name Issachar. 
\v 19 After, Leah conceiued againe, and bare Iaakob the sixt sonne. 
\v 20 Then Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowrie: nowe will mine husband dwell with me, because I haue borne him sixe sonnes: and she called his name Zebulun. 
\v 21 After that, shee bare a daughter, and shee called her name Dinah. 
\v 22 And God remembred Rahel, and God heard her, and opened her wombe. 
\v 23 So she conceiued and bare a sonne, and said, God hath taken away my rebuke. 
\v 24 And shee called his name Ioseph, saying, The Lord wil giue me yet another sonne. 
\v 25 And assoone as Rahel had borne Ioseph, Iaakob said to Laban, Sende me away that I may go vnto my place and to my countrey. 
\v 26 Giue me my wiues and my children, for whom I haue serued thee, and let me go: for thou knowest what seruice I haue done thee. 
\v 27 To whom Laban answered, If I haue nowe found fauour in thy sight tarie: I haue perceiued that the Lord hath blessed me for thy sake. 
\v 28 Also he said, Appoynt vnto me thy wages, and I will giue it thee. 
\v 29 But he sayd vnto him, Thou knowest, what seruice I haue done thee, and in what taking thy cattell hath bene vnder me. 
\v 30 For the litle, that thou haddest before I came, is increased into a multitude: and the Lord hath blessed thee by my comming: but nowe when shall I trauell for mine owne house also? 
\v 31 Then he saide, What shall I giue thee? And Iaakob answered, Thou shalt giue mee nothing at all: if thou wilt doe this thing for mee, I will returne, feede, and keepe thy sheepe. 
\v 32 I wil passe through all thy flockes this day, and separate from them all the sheepe with litle spots and great spots, and al blacke lambes among the sheepe, and the great spotted, and litle spotted among the goates: and it shalbe my wages. 
\v 33 So shall my righteousnesse answere for me hereafter, when it shall come for my rewarde before thy face, and euery one that hath not litle or great spots among the goates, and blacke among the sheepe, the same shalbe theft with me. 
\v 34 Then Laban sayde, Goe to, woulde God it might be according to thy saying. 
\v 35 Therefore he tooke out the same day the hee goates that were partie coloured and with great spots, and all the shee goates with litle and great spots, and all that had white in them, and all the blacke among the sheepe, and put them in the keeping of his sonnes. 
\v 36 And hee set three dayes iourney betweene himselfe and Iaakob. And Iaakob kept the rest of Labans sheepe. 
\v 37 Then Iaakob tooke rods of greene popular, and of hasell, and of the chesnut tree, and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appeare in the rods. 
\v 38 Then he put the rods, which he had pilled, in the gutters and watering troughes, when the sheepe came to drink, before the sheepe. (for they were in heate, when they came to drinke) 
\v 39 And the sheepe were in heate before the rods, and afterward brought forth yong of partie colour, and with small and great spots. 
\v 40 And Iaakob parted these lambes, and turned the faces of the flocke towardes these lambes partie coloured and all maner of blacke, among the sheepe of Laban: so hee put his owne flockes by themselues, and put them not with Labans flocke. 
\v 41 And in euery ramming time of the stronger sheepe, Iaakob layde the rods before the eyes of the sheepe in the gutters, that they might conceiue before the rods. 
\v 42 But when the sheepe were feeble, hee put them not in: and so the feebler were Labans, and the stronger Iaakobs. 
\v 43 So the man increased exceedingly, and had many flockes, and maide seruantes, and men seruants, and camels and asses. 
\c 31  
\p
\v 1 Now he heard the words of Labans sonnes, saying, Iaakob hath taken away all that was our fathers, and of our fathers goods hath he gotten all this honour. 
\v 2 Also Iaakob beheld the countenance of Laban, that it was not towards him as in times past: 
\v 3 And the Lord had said vnto Iaakob, Turne againe into the lande of thy fathers, and to thy kinred, and I wilbe with thee. 
\v 4 Therefore Iaakob sent and called Rahel and Leah to the fielde vnto his flocke. 
\v 5 Then sayde hee vnto them, I see your fathers countenance, that it is not towardes me as it was wont, and the God of my father hath bene with me. 
\v 6 And yee knowe that I haue serued your father with all my might. 
\v 7 But your father hath deceiued me, and changed my wages tenne times: but God suffred him not to hurt me. 
\v 8 If he thus sayd, The spotted shall be thy wages, then all the sheepe bare spotted: and if he sayd thus, the party coloured shalbe thy rewarde, then bare all the sheepe particoloured. 
\v 9 Thus hath God taken away your fathers substance, and giuen it me. 
\v 10 For in ramming time I lifted vp mine eyes and saw in a dreame, and beholde, ye hee goates leaped vpon the shee goates, that were partie coloured with litle and great spots spotted. 
\v 11 And the Angel of God sayde to mee in a dreame, Iaakob. And I answered, Lo, I am here. 
\v 12 And he sayde, Lift vp nowe thine eyes, and see all the hee goates leaping vpon ye shee goates that are partie coloured, spotted with litle and great spots: for I haue seene all that Laban doeth vnto thee. 
\v 13 I am the God of Beth-el, where thou anoyntedst the pillar, where thou vowedst a vowe vnto me. Nowe arise, get thee out of this countrey and returne vnto ye land where thou wast borne. 
\v 14 Then answered Rahel and Leah, and sayde vnto him, Haue wee any more porcion and inheritance in our fathers house? 
\v 15 Doeth not he count vs as strangers? for he hath solde vs, and hath eaten vp and consumed our money. 
\v 16 Therefore all the riches, which God hath taken from our father, is ours and our childrens: nowe then whatsoeuer God hath saide vnto thee, doe it. 
\v 17 Then Iaakob rose vp, and set his sonnes and his wiues vpon camels. 
\v 18 And he caried away all his flockes, and al his substance which he had gotten, to wit, his riches, which he had gotten in Padan Aram, to goe to Izhak his father vnto the land of Canaan. 
\v 19 Whe Laban was gone to shere his sheepe, Then Rahel stole her fathers idoles. 
\v 20 Thus Iaakob stole away ye heart of Laban the Aramite: for he told him not that he fled. 
\v 21 So fled he with all that he had, and he rose vp, and passed the riuer, and set his face towarde mount Gilead. 
\v 22 And the third day after was it told Laban, that Iaakob fled. 
\v 23 Then he tooke his brethren with him, and followed after him seuen dayes iourney, and ouertooke him at mount Gilead. 
\v 24 And God came to Laban the Aramite in a dreame by night, and sayde vnto him, Take heede that thou speake not to Iaakob ought saue good. 
\v 25 Then Laban ouertooke Iaakob, and Iaakob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban also with his brethren pitched vpon mount Gilead. 
\v 26 Then Laban sayde to Iaakob, What hast thou done? thou hast euen stolen away mine heart and caried away my daughters as though they had bene taken captiues with the sworde. 
\v 27 Wherfore diddest thou flie so secretly and steale away from me, and diddest not tel me, that I might haue sent thee foorth with mirth and with songs, with timbrel and with harpe? 
\v 28 But thou hast not suffered me to kisse my sonnes and my daughters: nowe thou hast done foolishly in doing so. 
\v 29 I am able to do you euill: but the God of your father spake vnto me yesternight, saying, Take heed that thou speake not to Iaakob ought saue good. 
\v 30 Nowe though thou wentest thy way, because thou greatly longedst after thy fathers house, yet wherefore hast thou stollen my gods? 
\v 31 Then Iaakob answered, and said to Laban, Because I was afraid, and thought that thou wouldest haue taken thy daughters from me. 
\v 32 But with whome thou findest thy gods, let him not liue. Search thou before our brethre what I haue of thine, and take it to thee, (but Iaakob wist not that Rahel had stolen them) 
\v 33 Then came Laban into Iaakobs tent, and into Leahs tent, and into the two maides tentes, but founde them not. So hee went out of Leahs tent, and entred into Rahels tent. 
\v 34 (Nowe Rahel had taken the idoles, and put them in the camels litter and sate downe vpon them) and Laban searched al the tent, but found them not. 
\v 35 Then said she to her father, My Lord, be not angrie that I cannot rise vp before thee: for the custome of women is vpon me: so he searched, but found not the idoles. 
\v 36 The Iaakob was wroth, and chode with Laban: Iaakob also answered and sayd to Laban, What haue I trespassed? what haue I offended, that thou hast pursued after me? 
\v 37 Seeing thou hast searched all my stuffe, what hast thou foud of all thine houshold stuffe? put it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may iudge betweene vs both. 
\v 38 This twenty yere I haue bin with thee: thine ewes and thy goates haue not cast their yong, and the rammes of thy flocke haue I not eaten. 
\v 39 Whatsoeuer was torne of beasts, I brought it not vnto thee, but made it good my selfe: of mine hand diddest thou require it, were it stollen by day or stollen by night. 
\v 40 I was in the day consumed with heate, and with frost in the night, and my sleepe departed from mine eyes. 
\v 41 Thus haue I bene twentie yeere in thine house, and serued thee fourteene yeeres for thy two daughters, and sixe yeeres for thy sheepe, and thou hast changed my wages tenne times. 
\v 42 Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the feare of Izhak had bene with me, surely thou haddest sent me away nowe emptie: but God behelde my tribulation, and the labour of mine hads, and rebuked thee yester night. 
\v 43 Then Laban answered, and saide vnto Iaakob, These daughters are my daughters, and these sonnes are my sonnes, and these sheepe are my sheepe, and all that thou seest, is mine, and what can I doe this day vnto these my daughters, or to their sonnes which they haue borne? 
\v 44 Nowe therefore come and let vs make a couenant, I and thou, which may be a witnes betweene me and thee. 
\v 45 Then tooke Iaakob a stone, and set it vp as a pillar: 
\v 46 And Iaakob sayde vnto his brethren, Gather stones: who brought stones, and made an heape, and they did eate there vpon the heape. 
\v 47 And Laban called it Iegar-sahadutha, and Iaakob called it Galeed. 
\v 48 For Laban sayd, This heape is witnesse betweene me and thee this day: therefore he called the name of it Galeed. 
\v 49 Also he called it Mizpah, because he said, The Lord looke betweene me and thee, when we shalbe departed one from another, 
\v 50 If thou shalt vexe my daughters, or shalt take wiues beside my daughters: there is no man with vs, beholde, God is witnesse betweene me and thee. 
\v 51 Moreouer Laban sayd to Iaakob, Beholde this heape, and behold the pillar, which I haue set betweene me and thee, 
\v 52 This heape shall be witnesse, and the pillar shall be witnesse, that I will not come ouer this heape to thee, and that thou shalt not passe ouer this heape and this pillar vnto me for euill. 
\v 53 The God of Abraham, and the God of Nabor, and the God of their father be iudge betweene vs: But Iaakob sware by the feare of his father Izhak. 
\v 54 Then Iaakob did offer a sacrifice vpon the mount, and called his brethren to eate bread. and they did eate bread, and taried all night in the mount. 
\v 55 And earely in the morning Laban rose vp and kissed his sonnes and his daughters, and blessed them, and Laban departing, went vnto his place againe. 
\c 32  
\p
\v 1 Nowe Iaakob went forth on his iourney and the Angels of God met him. 
\v 2 And when Iaakob saw them, he said, This is Gods hoste, and called the name of the same place Mahanaim. 
\v 3 Then Iaakob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother, vnto the land of Seir into the countrey of Edom: 
\v 4 To whom he gaue commandement, saying, Thus shall ye speake to my lorde Esau: thy seruant Iaakob sayeth thus, I haue bene a stranger with Laban, and taried vnto this time. 
\v 5 I haue beeues also and Asses, sheepe, and men seruantes, and women seruantes, and haue sent to shew my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight. 
\v 6 So ye messengers came againe to Iaakob, saying, We came vnto thy brother Esau, and hee also commeth against thee and foure hundreth men with him. 
\v 7 Then Iaakob was greatly afraid, and was sore troubled, and deuided the people that was with him, and the sheepe, and the beeues, and the camels into two companies. 
\v 8 For he said, If Esau come to ye one company and smite it, the other companie shall escape. 
\v 9 Moreouer Iaakob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Izhak: Lord, which saydest vnto me, Returne vnto thy coutrey and to thy kinred, and I will do thee good, 
\v 10 I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and al the trueth, which thou hast shewed vnto thy seruant: for with my staffe came I ouer this Iorden, and now haue I gotte two bads. 
\v 11 I pray thee, Deliuer me from the hande of my brother, from the hande of Esau: for I feare him, least he will come and smite me, and the mother vpon the children. 
\v 12 For thou saydest; I will surely doe thee good, and make thy seede as the sande of the sea, which can not be nombred for multitude. 
\v 13 And he taryed there the same night, and tooke of that which came to had, a present for Esau his brother: 
\v 14 Two hundreth shee goates and twenty hee goates, two hundreth ewes and twentie rammes: 
\v 15 Thirtie mylche camels with their coltes, fourtie kine, and ten bullockes, twentie she asses and ten foles. 
\v 16 So he deliuered them into the hande of his seruants, euery droue by themselues, and saide vnto his seruants, Passe before me, and put a space betweene droue and droue. 
\v 17 And he commanded the formost, saying, If Esau my brother meete thee, and aske thee, saying, Whose seruant art thou? And whither goest thou? And whose are these before thee? 
\v 18 Then thou shalt say, They be thy seruant Iaakobs: it is a present sent vnto my lord Esau: and beholde, he him selfe also is behinde vs. 
\v 19 So likewise commanded he the seconde and the thirde, and all that followed the droues, saying, After this maner, ye shall speake vnto Esau, when ye finde him. 
\v 20 And ye shall say moreouer, Beholde, thy seruant Iaakob commeth after vs (for he thought, I will appease his wrath with the present that goeth before me, and afterwarde I will see his face: it may be that he will accept me.) 
\v 21 So went the present before him: but he taried that night with the companie. 
\v 22 And he rose vp the same night, and tooke his two wiues, and his two maides, and his eleuen children, and went ouer the forde Iabbok. 
\v 23 And he tooke them, and sent them ouer the riuer, and sent ouer that he had. 
\v 24 Now when Iaakob was left him selfe alone, there wrestled a man with him vnto the breaking of the day. 
\v 25 And he sawe that he could not preuaile against him: therefore he touched the holowe of his thigh, and the holowe of Iaakobs thigh was loosed, as he wrestled with him. 
\v 26 And he saide, Let me goe, for the morning appeareth. Who answered, I will not let thee go except thou blesse me. 
\v 27 Then said he vnto him, What is thy name? And he said, Iaakob. 
\v 28 Then said he, Thy name shalbe called Iaakob no more, but Israel: because thou hast had power with God, thou shalt also preuaile with men. 
\v 29 Then Iaakob demaded, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore now doest thou aske my name? and he blessed him there 
\v 30 And Iaakob called the name of the place, Peniel: for, saide he, I haue seene God face to face, and my life is preserued. 
\v 31 And the sunne rose vp to him as he passed Peniel, and he halted vpon his thigh. 
\v 32 Therefore the children of Israel eate not of the sinewe that shranke in the hollowe of the thigh, vnto this day: because he touched the sinew that shranke in the holow of Iaakobs thigh. 
\c 33  
\p
\v 1 And as Iaakob lift vp his eyes, and looked, behold, Esau came, and with him foure hundreth men: and he deuided the children to Leah, and to Rahel, and to the two maides. 
\v 2 And he put the maides, and their children formost, and Leah, and her children after, and Rahel, and Ioseph hindermost. 
\v 3 So he went before them and bowed him selfe to the ground seuen times, vntill he came neere to his brother. 
\v 4 Then Esau ranne to meete him, and embraced him, and fell on his necke, and kissed him, and they wept. 
\v 5 And he lift vp his eyes, and sawe the women, and the children, and saide, Who are these with thee? And he answered, They are ye childre whome God of his grace hath giuen thy seruant. 
\v 6 Then came the maides neere, they, and their children, and bowed themselues. 
\v 7 Leah also with her children came neere and made obeysance: and after Ioseph and Rahel drew neere, and did reuerence. 
\v 8 Then he said, What meanest thou by all this droue, which I met? Who answered, I haue sent it, that I may finde fauour in the sight of my lorde: 
\v 9 And Esau said, I haue ynough, my brother: keepe that thou hast to thy selfe. 
\v 10 But Iaakob answered, Nay, I pray thee: if I haue found grace nowe in thy sight, then receiue my present at mine hande: for I haue seene thy face, as though I had seene the face of God, because thou hast accepted me. 
\v 11 I pray thee take my blessing, that is brought thee: for God hath had mercie on me, and therefore I haue all things: so he compelled him, and he tooke it. 
\v 12 And he saide, Let vs take our iourney and go, and I will goe before thee. 
\v 13 Then he answered him, My lord knoweth, that the children are tender, and the ewes and kine with yong vnder mine hande: and if they should ouerdriue them one day, all the flocke would die. 
\v 14 Let now my lord go before his seruant, and I will driue softly, according to ye pase of ye cattel, which is before me, and as the children be able to endure, vntill I come to my lord vnto Seir. 
\v 15 Then Esau said, I will leaue then some of my folke with thee. And he answered, what needeth this? let me finde grace in the sight of my lorde. 
\v 16 So Esau returned, and went his way that same day vnto Seir. 
\v 17 And Iaakob went forwarde towarde Succoth, and built him an house, and made boothes for his cattell: therefore he called the name of the place Succoth. 
\v 18 Afterward, Iaakob came safe to Sheche a citie, which is in the lande of Canaan, when he came from Padan Aram, and pitched before the citie. 
\v 19 And there he bought a parcell of ground, where hee pitched his tent, at the hande of the sonnes of Hamor Shechems father, for an hundreth pieces of money. 
\v 20 And he set vp there an altar, and called it, The mightie God of Israel. 
\c 34  
\p
\v 1 Then Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare vnto Iaakob, went out to see the daughters of that countrey. 
\v 2 Whome when Shechem the sonne of Hamor the Hiuite lorde of that countrey sawe, hee tooke her, and lay with her, and defiled her. 
\v 3 So his heart claue vnto Dinah the daughter of Iaakob: and he loued the maide, and spake kindely vnto the maide. 
\v 4 Then said Shechem to his father Hamor, saying, Get me this maide to wife. 
\v 5 (Nowe Iaakob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter, and his sonnes were with his cattell in the fielde: therefore Iaakob helde his peace, vntill they were come.) 
\v 6 Then Hamor the father of Shechem went out vnto Iaakob to commune with him. 
\v 7 And whe the sonnes of Iaakob were come out of the fielde and heard it, it grieued the men, and they were very angry, because he had wrought villenie in Israel, in that he had lyen with Iaakobs daughter: which thing ought not to be done. 
\v 8 And Hamor communed with them, saying, the soule of my sonne Shechem longeth for your daughter: giue her him to wife, I pray you. 
\v 9 So make affinitie with vs: giue your daughters vnto vs, and take our daughters vnto you, 
\v 10 And ye shall dwell with vs, and the lande shalbe before you: dwell, and doe your businesse in it, and haue your possessions therein. 
\v 11 Shechem also said vnto her father and vnto her brethren, Let me finde fauour in your eyes, and I will giue whatsoeuer ye shall appoint me. 
\v 12 Aske of me abundantly both dowrie and giftes, and I will giue as ye appoint me, so that ye giue me the maide to wife. 
\v 13 Then the sonnes of Iaakob answered Shechem and Hamor his father, talking deceitfully, because he had defiled Dinah their sister, 
\v 14 And they said vnto them, We can not do this thing, to giue our sister to an vncircumcised man: for that were a reproofe vnto vs. 
\v 15 But in this will we consent vnto you, if ye will be as we are, that euery man childe among you be circumcised: 
\v 16 Then will we giue our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to vs, and will dwell with you, and be one people. 
\v 17 But if ye will not hearken vnto vs to be circumcised, then will we take our daughter and depart. 
\v 18 Nowe their wordes pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamors sonne. 
\v 19 And the yong man deferd not to doe the thing because he loued Iaakobs daughter: he was also the most set by of all his fathers house. 
\v 20 Then Hamor and Shechem his Sonne went vnto the gate of their citie, and communed with the men of their citie, saying, 
\v 21 These men are peaceable with vs: and that they may dwell in the land, and doe their affaires therin (for behold, the land hath roume ynough for them) let vs take their daughters to wiues, and giue them our daughters. 
\v 22 Onely herein will the men consent vnto vs for to dwell with vs, and to be one people, if all the men children among vs be circumcised as they are circumcised. 
\v 23 Shall not their flockes and their substance and all their cattell be ours? onely let vs consent herein vnto them, and they will dwell with vs. 
\v 24 And vnto Hamor, and Shechem his sonne hearkened all that went out of the gate of his citie: and all the men children were circumcised, euen all that went out of the gate of his citie. 
\v 25 And on the thirde day (when they were sore) two of the sonnes of Iaakob, Simeon and Leui, Dinahs brethren tooke either of them his sworde and went into the citie boldly, and slue euery male. 
\v 26 They slewe also Hamor and Shechem his sonne with the edge of the sword, and tooke Dinah out of Shechems house, and went their way. 
\v 27 Againe the other sonnes of Iaakob came vpon the dead, and spoyled the citie, because they had defiled their sister. 
\v 28 They tooke their sheepe and their beeues, and their asses, and whatsoeuer was in the citie, and in the fieldes. 
\v 29 Also they caryed away captiue and spoyled all their goods, and all their children and their wiues, and all that was in the houses. 
\v 30 Then Iaakob said to Simeon and Leui, Ye haue troubled me, and made me stinke among the inhabitats of the land, aswell the Canaanites, as the Perizzites, and and I being few in nomber, they shall gather theselues together against me, and slay me, and so shall I, and my house be destroied. 
\v 31 And they answered, Shoulde hee abuse our sister as a whore? 
\c 35  
\p
\v 1 Then God sayde to Iaakob, Arise, goe vp to Beth-el and dwell there, and make there an altar vnto God, that appeared vnto thee, when thou fleddest from Esau thy brother. 
\v 2 Then saide Iaakob vnto his houshold and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and clense your selues, and change your garments: 
\v 3 For we will rise and goe vp to Beth-el, and I will make an altar there vnto God, which heard me in the day of my tribulation, and was with me in the way which I went. 
\v 4 And they gaue vnto Iaakob all the strange gods, which were in their hands, and all their earings which were in their eares, and Iaakob hidde them vnder an oke, which was by Shechem. 
\v 5 Then they went on their iourney, and the feare of God was vpon the cities that were roud about them: so that they did not follow after the sonnes of Iaakob. 
\v 6 So came Iaakob to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan: (the same is Beth-el) hee and all the people that was with him. 
\v 7 And he built there an altar, and had called the place, The God of Beth-el, because that God appeared vnto him there, when he fled from his brother. 
\v 8 Then Deborah Rebekahs nourse dyed, and was buried beneath Beth-el vnder an oke: and he called the name of it Allon Bachuth. 
\v 9 Againe God appeared vnto Iaakob, after he came out of Padan Aram, and blessed him. 
\v 10 Moreouer God said vnto him, Thy name is Iaakob: thy name shalbe no more called Iaakob, but Israel shalbe thy name: and hee called his name Israel. 
\v 11 Againe God said vnto him, I am God all sufficient. growe, and multiplie. a nation and a multitude of nations shall spring of thee, and Kings shall come out of thy loynes. 
\v 12 Also I will giue the lande, which I gaue to Abraham and Izhak, vnto thee: and vnto thy seede after thee will I giue that land. 
\v 13 So God ascended from him in the place where he had talked with him. 
\v 14 And Iaakob set vp a pillar in the place where he talked with him, a pillar of stone, and powred drinke offring thereon: also hee powred oyle thereon. 
\v 15 And Iaakob called the name of the place, where God spake with him, Beth-el. 
\v 16 Then they departed from Beth-el, and when there was about halfe a daies iourney of ground to come to Ephrath, Rahel trauailed, and in trauailing she was in perill. 
\v 17 And whe she was in paines of her labour, the midwife saide vnto her, Feare not: for thou shalt haue this sonne also. 
\v 18 Then as she was about to yeelde vp the Ghost (for she died) she called his name Ben-oni, but his father called him Beniamin. 
\v 19 Thus died Rahel, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Beth-lehem. 
\v 20 And Iaakob set a pillar vpon her graue: This is the pillar of Rahels graue vnto this day. 
\v 21 Then Israel went forwarde, and pitched his tent beyond Migdal-eder. 
\v 22 Now, when Israel dwelt in that land, Reuben went, and lay with Bilhah his fathers concubine, and it came to Israels eare. And Iaakob had twelue sonnes. 
\v 23 The sonnes of Leah: Reuben Iaakobs eldest sonne, and Simeon, and Leui, and Iudah, and Issachar, and Zebulun. 
\v 24 The sonnes of Rahel: Ioseph and Beniamin. 
\v 25 And the sonnes of Bilhah Rahels maide: Dan and Naphtali. 
\v 26 And the sonnes of Zilpah Leahs maide: Gad and Asher. These are the sonnes of Iaakob, which were borne him in Padan Aram. 
\v 27 Then Iaakob came vnto Izhak his father to Mamre a citie of Arbah: this is Hebron, where Abraham and Izhak were strangers. 
\v 28 And the daies of Izhak were an hundreth and fourescore yeeres. 
\v 29 And Izhak gaue vp the ghost and died, and was gathered vnto his people, being olde and full of daies: and his sonnes Esau and Iaakob buried him. 
\c 36  
\p
\v 1 Nowe these are the generations of Esau, which is Edom. 
\v 2 Esau tooke his wiues of the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon an Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon an Hiuite, 
\v 3 And tooke Basemath Ishmaels daughter, sister of Nebaioth. 
\v 4 And Adah bare vnto Esau, Eliphaz: and Basemath bare Reuel. 
\v 5 Also Aholibamah bare Ieush, and Iaalam, and Korah: these are the sonnes of Esau which were borne to him in the land of Canaan. 
\v 6 So Esau tooke his wiues and his sonnes, and his daughters, and all the soules of his house, and his flocks, and all his cattell, and all his substance, which he had gotten in the land of Canaan, and went into an other countrey from his brother Iaakob. 
\v 7 For their riches were so great, that they could not dwell together, and the lande, wherein they were strangers, coulde not receiue them because of their flockes. 
\v 8 Therefore dwelt Esau in mount Seir: this Esau is Edom. 
\v 9 So these are the generations of Esau father of Edom in mount Seir. 
\v 10 These are the names of Esaus sonnes: Eliphaz, the sonne of Adah, the wife of Esau, and Reuel the sonne of Bashemath, the wife of Esau. 
\v 11 And the sonnes of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz. 
\v 12 And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esaus sonne, and bare vnto Eliphaz, Amalek: these be the sonnes of Adah Esaus wife. 
\v 13 And these are the sonnes of Reuel: Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah: these were the sonnes of Bashemath Esaus wife. 
\v 14 And these were the sonnes of Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, daughter of Zibeon Esaus wife: for she bare vnto Esau, Ieush, and Iaalam, and Korah. 
\v 15 These were Dukes of the sonnes of Esau: the sonnes of Eliphaz, the first borne of Esau: Duke Teman, Duke Omar, Duke Zepho, Duke Kenaz, 
\v 16 Duke Korah, Duke Gatam, Duke Amalek: these are the Dukes that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom: these were the sonnes of Adah. 
\v 17 And these are the sonnes of Reuel Esaus sonne: Duke Nahath, Duke Zerah, Duke Shammah, Duke Mizzah: these are the Dukes that came of Reuel in the land of Edom: these are the sonnes of Bashemath Esaus wife. 
\v 18 Likewise these were the sonnes of Aholibamah Esaus wife: Duke Ieush, Duke Iaalam, Duke Korah: these Dukes came of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah Esaus wife. 
\v 19 These are the children of Esau, and these are the Dukes of them: This Esau is Edom. 
\v 20 These are the sonnes of Seir the Horite, which inhabited the lande before, Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah. 
\v 21 And Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan: these are the Dukes of the Horites, the sonnes of Seir in the land of Edom. 
\v 22 And the sonnes of Lotan were, Hori and Hemam, and Lotans sister was Timna. 
\v 23 And the sonnes of Shobal were these: Aluan, and Manahath, and Ebal, Shepho, and Onam. 
\v 24 And these are the sonnes of Zibeon: Both Aiah, and Anah: this was Anah that founde mules in the wildernesse, as he fedde his father Zibeons asses. 
\v 25 And the children of Anah were these: Dishon and Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah. 
\v 26 Also these are the sonnes of Dishan: Hemdan, and Eshban, and Ithran, and Cheran. 
\v 27 The sonnes of Ezer are these: Bilhan, and Zaauan, and Akan. 
\v 28 The sonnes of Dishan are these: Vz, and Aran. 
\v 29 These are the Dukes of the Horites: Duke Lotan, Duke Shobal, Duke Zibeon, Duke Anah, 
\v 30 Duke Dishon, Duke Ezer, Duke Dishan: these bee the Dukes of the Horites, after their Dukedomes in the land of Seir. 
\v 31 And these are the Kings that reigned in the lande of Edom, before there reigned any King ouer the children of Israel. 
\v 32 Then Bela the sonne of Beor reigned in Edom, and the name of his citie was Dinhabah. 
\v 33 And when Bela dyed, Iobab the sonne of Zerah of Bozra reigned in his steade. 
\v 34 When Iobab also was dead, Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his steade. 
\v 35 And after the death of Husham, Hadad the sonne of Bedad, which slewe Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his steade, and the name of his citie was Auith. 
\v 36 When Hadad was dead, then Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his steade. 
\v 37 When Samlah was dead, Shaul of Rehoboth by the riuer, reigned in his steade. 
\v 38 When Shaul dyed, Baal-hanan the sonne of Achbor reigned in his steade. 
\v 39 And after the death of Baal-hanan the sonne of Achbor, Hadad reigned in his stead, and the name of his citie was Pau: and his wiues name Mehetabel the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab. 
\v 40 Then these are the names of the Dukes of Esau according to their families, their places and by their names: Duke Timna, Duke Aluah, Duke Ietheth, 
\v 41 Duke Aholibamah, Duke Elah, Duke Pinon, 
\v 42 Duke Kenaz, Duke Teman, Duke Mibzar, 
\v 43 Duke Magdiel, Duke Iram: these bee the Dukes of Edom, according to their habitations, in the lande of their inheritance. This Esau is the father of Edom. 
\c 37  
\p
\v 1 Iaakob nowe dwelt in the lande, wherein his father was a stranger, in the lande of Canaan. 
\v 2 These are the generations of Iaakob, when Ioseph was seuenteene yeere olde: he kept sheepe with his brethren, and the childe was with the sonnes of Bilhah, and with the sonnes of Zilpah, his fathers wiues. And Ioseph brought vnto their father their euill saying. 
\v 3 Nowe Israel loued Ioseph more then all his sonnes, because he begate him in his old age, and he made him a coat of many colours. 
\v 4 So when his brethren sawe that their father loued him more then all his brethren, then they hated him, and could not speake peaceably vnto him. 
\v 5 And Ioseph dreamed a dreame, and told his brethren, who hated him so much the more. 
\v 6 For he saide vnto them, Heare, I pray you, this dreame which I haue dreamed. 
\v 7 Beholde nowe, wee were binding sheues in the middes of the field: and loe, my shefe arose and also stoode vpright, and behold, your sheues compassed rounde about, and did reuerence to my shefe. 
\v 8 Then his brethren saide to him, What, shalt thou reigne ouer vs, and rule vs? or shalt thou haue altogether dominion ouer vs? And they hated him so much the more, for his dreames, and for his wordes. 
\v 9 Againe hee dreamed an other dreame, and tolde it his brethren, and saide, Behold, I haue had one dreame more, and beholde, the Sunne and the Moone and eleuen starres did reuerence to me. 
\v 10 Then he tolde it vnto his father and to his brethren, and his father rebuked him, and saide vnto him, What is this dreame, which thou hast dreamed? shall I, and thy mother, and thy brethren come in deede and fall on the ground before thee? 
\v 11 And his brethren enuied him, but his father noted the saying. 
\v 12 Then his brethren went to keepe their fathers sheepe in Shechem. 
\v 13 And Israel said vnto Ioseph, Doe not thy brethren keepe in Shechem? come and I will send thee to them. 
\v 14 And he answered him, I am here. Then he saide vnto him, Goe now, see whether it bee well with thy brethren, and how the flocks prosper, and bring me word againe. so hee sent him from the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem. 
\v 15 Then a man found him: for lo, hee was wandring in the fielde, and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou? 
\v 16 And he answered, I seeke my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they keepe sheepe. 
\v 17 And the man said, they are departed hece: for I heard them say, Let vs goe vnto Dothan. Then went Ioseph after his brethren, and found them in Dothan. 
\v 18 And when they sawe him a farre off, euen before he came at them, they conspired against him for to slay him. 
\v 19 For they sayd one to another, Behold, this dreamer commeth. 
\v 20 Come now therefore, and let vs slay him, and cast him into some pitte, and wee will say, A wicked beast hath deuoured him: then wee shall see, what will come of his dreames. 
\v 21 But when Reuben heard that, he deliuered him out of their handes, and saide, Let vs not kill him. 
\v 22 Also Reuben saide vnto them, Shed not blood, but cast him into this pitte that is in the wildernesse, and lay no hande vpon him. Thus he said, that he might deliuer him out of their hand, and restore him to his father againe. 
\v 23 Now when Ioseph was come vnto his brethren, they stript Ioseph out of his coate, his particoloured coate that was vpon him. 
\v 24 And they tooke him, and cast him into a pit, and the pit was emptie, without water in it. 
\v 25 Then they sate them downe to eate bread: and they lift vp their eyes and looked, and behold, there came a companie of Ishmeelites from Gilead, and their camels laden with spicerie, and balme, and myrrhe, and were going to cary it downe into Egypt. 
\v 26 Then Iudah said vnto his brethren, What auaileth it, if we slay our brother, though wee keepe his blood secret? 
\v 27 Come and let vs sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our handes be vpon him: for he is our brother and our flesh: and his brethren obeyed. 
\v 28 Then the Midianites marchant men passed by, and they drewe foorth, and lift Ioseph out of the pit, and solde Ioseph vnto the Ishmeelites for twentie pieces of siluer: who brought Ioseph into Egypt. 
\v 29 Afterwarde Reuben returned to the pit, and beholde, Ioseph was not in the pit: then he rent his clothes, 
\v 30 And returned to his brethren, and said, The childe is not yonder, and I, whither shall I goe? 
\v 31 And they tooke Iosephs coate, and killed a kidde of the goates, and dipped the coate in the blood. 
\v 32 So they sent that particoloured coat, and they brought it vnto their father, and saide, This haue we founde: see nowe, whether it be thy sonnes coate, or no. 
\v 33 Then he knewe it and said, It is my sonnes coate: a wicked beast hath deuoured him: Ioseph is surely torne in pieces. 
\v 34 And Iaakob rent his clothes, and put sackecloth about his loynes, and sorowed for his sonne a long season. 
\v 35 Then all his sonnes and all his daughters rose vp to comfort him, but he woulde not be comforted, but said, Surely I will go downe into the graue vnto my sonne mourning: so his father wept for him. 
\v 36 And the Midianites solde him into Egypt vnto Potiphar an Eunuche of Pharaohs, and his chiefe stewarde. 
\c 38  
\p
\v 1 And at that time Iudah went downe from his brethren, and turned in to a man called Hirah an Adullamite. 
\v 2 And Iudah sawe there the daughter of a man called Suah a Canaanite: and he tooke her to wife, and went in vnto her. 
\v 3 So she conceiued and bare a sonne, and he called his name Er. 
\v 4 And she conceiued againe, and bare a sonne, and she called his name Onan. 
\v 5 Moreouer she bare yet a sonne, whome she called Shelah: and Iudah was at Chezib when she bare him. 
\v 6 Then Iudah tooke a wife to Er his first borne sonne whose name was Tamar. 
\v 7 Now Er the first borne of Iudah was wicked in the sight of the Lord: therefore the Lord slewe him. 
\v 8 Then Iudah said to Onan, Goe in vnto thy brothers wife, and do the office of a kinsman vnto her, and raise vp seede vnto thy brother. 
\v 9 And Onan knewe that the seede should not be his: therefore when he went in vnto his brothers wife, he spilled it on the grounde, least he should giue seede vnto his brother. 
\v 10 And it was wicked in the eyes of the Lord, which he did: wherefore he slewe him also. 
\v 11 Then said Iudah to Tamar his daughter in lawe, Remaine a widowe in thy fathers house, till Shelah my sonne growe vp (for he thought thus, Least he die as well as his brethren.) So Tamar went and dwelt in her fathers house. 
\v 12 And in processe of time also the daughter of Shuah Iudahs wife dyed. Then Iudah, when he had left mourning, went vp to his sheepe sherers to Timnah, he, and his neighbour Hirah the Adullamite. 
\v 13 And it was tolde Tamar, saying, beholde, thy father in lawe goeth vp to Timnah, to shere his sheepe. 
\v 14 Then she put her widowes garments off from her, and couered her with a vaile, and wrapped her selfe, and sate downe in Pethah-enaim, which is by the way to Timnah, because she sawe that Shelah was growen, and she was not giuen vnto him to wife. 
\v 15 When Iudah sawe her, he iudged her an whore: for she had couered her face. 
\v 16 And he turned to the way towardes her, and saide, Come, I pray thee, let me lie with thee. (for he knewe not that she was his daughter in lawe) And she answered, What wilt thou giue me for to lie with me? 
\v 17 Then said he, I will sende thee a kid of the goates from the flocke. and she said, Well, if thou wilt giue me a pledge, till thou sende it. 
\v 18 Then he saide, What is the pledge that I shall giue thee? And she answered, Thy signet, and thy cloke, and thy staffe that is in thine hande. So he gaue it her, and lay by her, and she was with childe by him. 
\v 19 Then she rose, and went and put her vaile from her and put on her widowes raiment. 
\v 20 Afterwarde Iudah sent a kid of the goates by the hande of his neighbour the Adullamite, for to receiue his pledge from the womans hand: but he found her not. 
\v 21 Then asked he the men of that place, saying, Where is ye whore, that sate in Enaim by the way side? And they answered, There was no whore here. 
\v 22 He came therefore to Iudah againe, and said, I can not finde her, and also the men of the place said, There was no whore there. 
\v 23 Then Iudah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: beholde, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her. 
\v 24 Now after three moneths, one tolde Iudah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the whore, and lo, with playing the whore, she is great with childe. Then Iudah saide, Bring ye her foorth and let her be burnt. 
\v 25 When she was brought foorth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, vnto whom these things pertaine, am I with childe: and saide also, Looke, I pray thee, whose these are, the seale, and the cloke, and the staffe. 
\v 26 Then Iudah knewe them, and said, She is more righteous then I: for she hath done it because I gaue her not to Shelah my sonne. So he lay with her no more. 
\v 27 Now, when the time was come that she should be deliuered, beholde, there were twinnes in her wombe. 
\v 28 And when she was in trauell, the one put out his hand: and the midwife tooke and bound a red threde about his hand, saying, This is come out first. 
\v 29 But when he plucked his hand backe againe, loe, his brother came out, and the midwife said, How hast thou broken the breach vpon thee? and his name was called Pharez. 
\v 30 And afterward came out his brother that had the red threde about his hande, and his name was called Zarah. 
\c 39  
\p
\v 1 Now Ioseph was brought downe into Egypt: and Potiphar an Eunuche of Pharaohs (and his chiefe stewarde an Egyptian) bought him at the hande of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him thither. 
\v 2 And the Lord was with Ioseph, and he was a man that prospered and was in the house of his master the Egyptian. 
\v 3 And his master sawe that the Lord was with him, and that the Lord made all that hee did to prosper in his hande. 
\v 4 So Ioseph founde fauour in his sight, and serued him: and he made him ruler of his house, and put all that he had in his hand. 
\v 5 And from that time that he had made him ruler ouer his house and ouer all that he had, the Lord blessed the Egyptians house for Iosephs sake: and the blessing of the Lord was vpon all that he had in the house, and in the fielde. 
\v 6 Therefore he left all that he had in Iosephs hand, and tooke accompt of nothing, that was with him, saue onely of the bread, which he did eate. And Ioseph was a faire person, and well fauoured. 
\v 7 Nowe therefore after these thinges, his masters wife cast her eyes vpon Ioseph, and saide, Lye with me. 
\v 8 But he refused and said to his masters wife, Beholde, my master knoweth not what he hath in the house with me, but hath committed all that he hath to mine hande. 
\v 9 There is no man greater in this house then I: neither hath he kept any thing from me, but only thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickednes and so sinne against God? 
\v 10 And albeit she spake to Ioseph day by day, yet he hearkened not vnto her, to lye with her, or to be in her company. 
\v 11 Then on a certaine day Ioseph entred into the house, to doe his businesse: and there was no man of the houshold in the house: 
\v 12 Therefore she caught him by his garmet, saying, Sleepe with me: but he left his garment in her hand and fled, and got him out. 
\v 13 Nowe when she sawe that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled out, 
\v 14 She called vnto the men of her house, and tolde them, saying, Beholde, he hath brought in an Ebrewe vnto vs to mocke vs: who came in to me for to haue slept with me: but I cryed with a loude voyce. 
\v 15 And when he heard that I lift vp my voice and cryed, he left his garment with me, and fled away, and got him out. 
\v 16 So she layde vp his garment by her, vntill her lord came home. 
\v 17 Then she tolde him according to these words, saying, The Ebrew seruat, which thou hast brought vnto vs, came in to me, to mocke me. 
\v 18 But assoone as I lift vp my voyce and cried, he left his garment with me, and fled out. 
\v 19 Then when his master heard the wordes of his wife, which she tolde him, saying, After this maner did thy seruant to me, his anger was kindled. 
\v 20 And Iosephs master tooke him and put him in prison, in the place, where the kings prisoners lay bounde: and there he was in prison. 
\v 21 But the Lord was with Ioseph, and shewed him mercie, and got him fauour in the sight of the master of the prison. 
\v 22 And the keeper of the prison committed to Iosephs hande all the prisoners that were in the prison, and whatsoeuer they did there, that did he. 
\v 23 And the keeper of the prison looked vnto nothing that was vnder his hande, seeing that the Lord was with him: for whatsoeuer he did, the Lord made it to prosper. 
\c 40  
\p
\v 1 And after these things, the butler of the King of Egypt and his baker offended their lorde the King of Egypt. 
\v 2 And Pharaoh was angrie against his two officers, against the chiefe butler, and against the chiefe baker. 
\v 3 Therefore he put them in ward in his chiefe stewardes house, in the prison and place where Ioseph was bound. 
\v 4 And the chiefe steward gaue Ioseph charge ouer them, and he serued them: and they continued a season in warde. 
\v 5 And they both dreamed a dreame, eyther of them his dreame in one night, eche one according to the interpretation of his dreame, both the butler and the baker of the King of Egypt, which were bounde in the prison. 
\v 6 And when Ioseph came in vnto them in the morning, and looked vpon them, beholde, they were sad. 
\v 7 And he asked Pharaohs officers, that were with him in his masters warde, saying, Wherefore looke ye so sadly to day? 
\v 8 Who answered him, We haue dreamed, eche one a dreame, and there is none to interprete the same. Then Ioseph saide vnto them, Are not interpretations of God? tell them me nowe. 
\v 9 So the chiefe butler tolde his dreame to Ioseph, and said vnto him, In my dreame, behold, a vine was before me, 
\v 10 And in the vine were three branches, and as it budded, her flowre came foorth: and the clusters of grapes waxed ripe. 
\v 11 And I had Pharaohs cup in mine hande, and I tooke the grapes, and wrung the into Pharaohs cup, and I gaue the cup into Pharaohs hand. 
\v 12 Then Ioseph sayde vnto him, This is the interpretation of it: The three braunches are three dayes. 
\v 13 Within three dayes shall Pharaoh lift vp thine head, and restore thee vnto thine office, and thou shalt giue Pharaohs cup into his hand after the olde maner, when thou wast his butler. 
\v 14 But haue me in remembrance with thee, when thou art in good case, and shew mercie, I pray thee, vnto me, and make mention of me to Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring me out of this house. 
\v 15 For I was stollen away by theft out of the land of the Ebrewes, and here also haue I done nothing, wherefore they should put mee in the dungeon. 
\v 16 And when the chiefe baker sawe that the interpretation was good, hee saide vnto Ioseph, Also mee thought in my dreame that I had three white baskets on mine head. 
\v 17 And in the vppermost basket there was of all maner baken meates for Pharaoh: and the birdes did eate them out of the basket vpon mine head. 
\v 18 Then Ioseph answered, and saide, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three dayes: 
\v 19 Within three dayes shall Pharaoh take thine head from thee, and shall hang thee on a tree, and the birdes shall eate thy flesh from off thee. 
\v 20 And so the third day, which was Pharaohs birthday, hee made a feast vnto all his seruants: and hee lifted vp the head of the chiefe butler, and the head of the chiefe baker among his seruants. 
\v 21 And he restored the chiefe butler vnto his butlershippe, who gaue the cup into Pharaohs hande, 
\v 22 But he hanged the chiefe baker, as Ioseph had interpreted vnto them. 
\v 23 Yet the chiefe butler did not remember Ioseph, but forgate him. 
\c 41  
\p
\v 1 And two yeeres after, Pharaoh also dreamed, and beholde, he stoode by a riuer, 
\v 2 And loe, there came out of the riuer seuen goodly kine and fatfleshed, and they fedde in a medowe: 
\v 3 And loe, seuen other kine came vp after the out of the riuer, euill fauoured and leane fleshed, and stoode by the other kine vpon the brinke of the riuer. 
\v 4 And the euilfauoured and leane fleshed kine did eate vp the seuen welfauoured and fatte kine: so Pharaoh awoke. 
\v 5 Againe he slept, and dreamed the second time: and beholde, seuen eares of corne grewe vpon one stalke, ranke and goodly. 
\v 6 And loe, seuen thinne eares, and blasted with the east winde, sprang vp after them: 
\v 7 And the thinne eares deuoured the seuen ranke and full eares. then Pharaoh awaked, and loe, it was a dreame. 
\v 8 Nowe when the morning came, his spirit was troubled: therefore he sent and called all the soothsayers of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof, and Pharaoh tolde them his dreames: but none coulde interprete them to Pharaoh. 
\v 9 Then spake the chiefe butler vnto Pharaoh, saying, I call to minde my faultes this day. 
\v 10 Pharaoh being angrie with his seruantes, put me in ward in the chiefe stewards house, both me and the chiefe baker. 
\v 11 Then we dreamed a dreame in one night, both I, and he: we dreamed eche man according to the interpretation of his dreame. 
\v 12 And there was with vs a yong man, an Ebrew, seruant vnto the chiefe steward, whome when we told, he declared our dreames to vs, to euery one he declared according to his dreame. 
\v 13 And as he declared vnto vs, so it came to passe: for he restored me to mine office, and hanged him. 
\v 14 Then sent Pharaoh, and called Ioseph, and they brought him hastily out of prison, and he shaued him, and chaunged his rayment, and came to Pharaoh. 
\v 15 Then Pharaoh sayde to Ioseph, I haue dreamed a dreame, and no man can interprete it, and I haue hearde say of thee, that when thou hearest a dreame, thou canst interprete it. 
\v 16 And Ioseph answered Pharaoh, saying, Without me God shall answere for the wealth of Pharaoh. 
\v 17 And Pharaoh sayde vnto Ioseph, In my dreame, beholde, I stoode by the banke of the riuer: 
\v 18 And lo, there came vp out of the riuer seuen fat fleshed, and welfauoured kine, and they fedde in the medowe. 
\v 19 Also loe, seuen other kine came vp after them, poore and very euilfauoured, and leanefleshed: I neuer sawe the like in all the lande of Egypt, for euilfauoured. 
\v 20 And the leane and euilfauoured kine did eate vp the first seuen fat kine. 
\v 21 And when they had eaten them vp, it could not be knowen that they had eaten them, but they were still as euilfauoured, as they were at the beginning: so did I awake. 
\v 22 Moreouer I sawe in my dreame, and beholde, seuen eares sprang out of one stalke, full and faire. 
\v 23 And lo, seuen eares, withered, thinne, and blasted with the East winde, sprang vp after them. 
\v 24 And the thinne eares deuoured the seuen good eares. Nowe I haue tolde the soothsayers, and none can declare it vnto me. 
\v 25 Then Ioseph answered Pharaoh, Both Pharaohs dreames are one. God hath shewed Pharaoh, what he is about to doe. 
\v 26 The seuen good kine are seuen yeres, and the seuen good eares are seuen yeeres: this is one dreame. 
\v 27 Likewise the seuen thinne and euilfauoured kine, that came out after them, are seuen yeeres: and the seuen emptie eares blasted with the East winde, are seuen yeeres of famine. 
\v 28 This is the thing which I haue saide vnto Pharaoh, that God hath shewed vnto Pharaoh, what he is about to doe. 
\v 29 Beholde, there come seuen yeeres of great plentie in all the land of Egypt. 
\v 30 Againe, there shall arise after them seuen yeeres of famine, so that all the plentie shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt, and the famine shall consume the land: 
\v 31 Neither shall the plentie bee knowen in the land, by reason of this famine that shall come after: for it shalbe exceeding great. 
\v 32 And therefore the dreame was doubled vnto Pharaoh the second time, because the thing is established by God, and God hasteth to performe it. 
\v 33 Nowe therefore let Pharaoh prouide for a man of vnderstanding and wisedome, and set him ouer the land of Egypt. 
\v 34 Let Pharaoh make and appoynt officers ouer the lande, and take vp the fift part of the land of Egypt in the seuen plenteous yeeres. 
\v 35 Also let them gather all the foode of these good yeeres that come, and lay vp corne vnder the hand of Pharaoh for foode, in the cities, and let them keepe it. 
\v 36 So the foode shall be for the prouision of the lande, against the seuen yeeres of famine, which shalbe in the lande of Egypt, that the land perish not by famine. 
\v 37 And the saying pleased Pharaoh and all his seruants. 
\v 38 Then saide Pharaoh vnto his seruants, Can we finde such a man as this, in whom is the Spirit of God? 
\v 39 The Pharaoh said to Ioseph, For as much as God hath shewed thee all this, there is no man of vnderstanding, or of wisedome like vnto thee. 
\v 40 Thou shalt be ouer mine house, and at thy word shall all my people be armed, onely in the kings throne will I be aboue thee. 
\v 41 Moreouer Pharaoh said to Ioseph, Behold, I haue set thee ouer all the land of Egypt. 
\v 42 And Pharaoh tooke off his ring from his hand, and put it vpon Iosephs hand, and arayed him in garments of fine linnen, and put a golden cheyne about his necke. 
\v 43 So he set him vpon the best charet that hee had, saue one: and they cryed before him, Abrech, and placed him ouer all the land of Egypt. 
\v 44 Againe Pharaoh saide vnto Ioseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift vp his hand or his foote in all the land of Egypt. 
\v 45 And Pharaoh called Iosephs name Zaphnath-paaneah: and he gaue him to wife Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah prince of On. then went Ioseph abrode in the land of Egypt. 
\v 46 And Ioseph was thirtie yeere old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt: and Ioseph departing from the presence of Pharaoh, went throughout all the land of Egypt. 
\v 47 And in the seuen plenteous yeres the earth brought foorth store. 
\v 48 And hee gathered vp all the foode of the seuen plenteous yeeres, which were in the lande of Egypt, and layde vp foode in the cities: the foode of the fielde, that was round about euery citie, layde he vp in the same. 
\v 49 So Ioseph gathered wheate, like vnto the sand of the sea in multitude out of measure, vntill he left numbring: for it was without number. 
\v 50 Now vnto Ioseph were borne two sonnes (before the yeeres of famine came) which Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah prince of On bare vnto him. 
\v 51 And Ioseph called the name of the first borne Manasseh: for God, said he, hath made me forget all my labour and al my fathers houshold. 
\v 52 Also hee called the name of the second, Ephraim: For God, sayde he hath made me fruitfull in the land of mine affliction. 
\v 53 So the seuen yeeres of the plentie that was in the land of Egypt were ended. 
\v 54 Then began the seuen yeeres of famine to come, according as Ioseph had saide: and the famine was in all landes, but in all the land of Egypt was bread. 
\v 55 At the length all the lande of Egypt was affamished, and the people cryed to Pharaoh for bread. And Pharaoh said vnto all the Egyptians, Goe to Ioseph: what he sayth to you, doe ye. 
\v 56 When the famine was vpon all the land, Ioseph opened all places, wherein the store was, and solde vnto the Egyptians: for the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt. 
\v 57 And all countries came to Egypt to bye corne of Ioseph, because the famine was sore in all landes. 
\c 42  
\p
\v 1 Then Iaakob saw that there was foode in Egypt, and Iaakob said vnto his sonnes, Why gaze ye one vpon an other? 
\v 2 And he said, Behold, I haue heard that there is foode in Egypt, Get you downe thither, and bie vs foode thence, that we may liue and not die. 
\v 3 So went Iosephs ten brethren downe to bye corne of the Egyptians. 
\v 4 But Beniamin Iosephs brother woulde not Iaakob send with his brethren: for he saide, Least death should befall him. 
\v 5 And the sonnes of Israel came to bye foode among them that came: for there was famine in the land of Canaan. 
\v 6 Now Ioseph was gouerner of the land, who solde to all the people of the lande: then Iosephs brethren came, and bowed their face to the groud before him. 
\v 7 And when Ioseph sawe his brethren, hee knewe them, and made himselfe straunge toward them, and spake to them roughly, and saide vnto them, Whence come yee? Who answered, Out of the land of Canaan, to bye vitaile. 
\v 8 (Now Ioseph knewe his brethren, but they knew not him. 
\v 9 And Ioseph remembred the dreames, which he dreamed of them) and he sayde vnto them, Ye are spies, and are come to see the weaknesse of the land. 
\v 10 But they sayde vnto him, Nay, my lorde, but to bye vitayle thy seruants are come. 
\v 11 Wee are all one mans sonnes: wee meane truely, and thy seruants are no spies. 
\v 12 But he saide vnto them, Nay, but yee are come to see the weakenes of the land. 
\v 13 And they said, We thy seruants are twelue brethren, the sonnes of one man in the lande of Canaan: and beholde, the yongest is this day with our father, and one is not. 
\v 14 Againe Ioseph sayde vnto them, This is it that I spake vnto you, saying, Ye are spies. 
\v 15 Hereby ye shall be proued: by the life of Pharaoh, ye shall not goe hence, except your yongest brother come hither. 
\v 16 Send one of you which may fet your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proued, whether there bee trueth in you: or els by the life of Pharaoh ye are but spies. 
\v 17 So he put them in warde three dayes. 
\v 18 Then Ioseph said vnto them the third day, This do, and liue: for I feare God. 
\v 19 If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bounde in your prison house, and goe ye, carie foode for the famine of your houses: 
\v 20 But bring your yonger brother vnto me, that your wordes may be tried, and that ye dye not: and they did so. 
\v 21 And they said one to another, We haue verily sinned against our brother, in that we sawe the anguish of his soule, when he besought vs, and we would not heare him: therefore is this trouble come vpon vs. 
\v 22 And Reuben answered them, saying, Warned I not you, saying, Sinne not against the childe, and ye would not heare? and lo, his blood is now required. 
\v 23 (And they were not aware that Ioseph vnderstoode them: for he spake vnto them by an interpreter.) 
\v 24 Then he turned from them, and wept, and turned to them againe, and communed with them, and tooke Simeon from among them, and bounde him before their eyes. 
\v 25 So Ioseph commanded that they should fill their sackes with wheate, and put euery mans money againe in his sacke, and giue them vitaile for the iourney: and thus did he vnto them. 
\v 26 And they layed their vitaile vpon their asses, and departed thence. 
\v 27 And as one of them opened his sacke for to giue his asse prouender in the ynne, he espyed his money: for lo, it was in his sackes mouth. 
\v 28 Then he sayde vnto his brethren, My money is restored: for loe, it is euen in my sacke. And their heart fayled them, and they were astonished, and sayde one to another, What is this, that God hath done vnto vs? 
\v 29 And they came vnto Iaakob their father vnto the lande of Canaan, and tolde him all that had befallen them, saying, 
\v 30 The man, who is Lord of the lande, spake roughly to vs, and put vs in prison as spyes of the countrey. 
\v 31 And we sayd vnto him, We are true men, and are no spies. 
\v 32 We be twelue brethren, sonnes of our father: one is not, and the yongest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan. 
\v 33 Then the Lord of the countrey sayde vnto vs, Hereby shall I knowe if ye be true men: Leaue one of your brethren with me, and take foode for the famine of your houses and depart, 
\v 34 And bring your yongest brother vnto me, that I may knowe that ye are no spies, but true men: so will I deliuer you your brother, and yee shall occupie in the land. 
\v 35 And as they emptied their sacks, behold, euery mans bundel of money was in his sacke: and when they and their father sawe the bundels of their money, they were afrayde. 
\v 36 Then Iaakob their father said to them, Ye haue robbed me of my children: Ioseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Beniamin: all these things are against me. 
\v 37 Then Reuben answered his father, saying, Slay my two sonnes, if I bring him not to thee againe: deliuer him to mine hand, and I will bring him to thee againe. 
\v 38 But he said, My sonne shall not go downe with you: for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if death come vnto him by the way which ye goe, then ye shall bring my gray head with sorow vnto the graue. 
\c 43  
\p
\v 1 Now great famine was in the land. 
\v 2 And when they had eaten vp the vitaile, which they had brought from Egypt, their father sayd vnto them, Turne againe, and bye vs a little foode. 
\v 3 And Iudah answered him, saying, The man charged vs by an othe, saying, Neuer see my face, except your brother be with you. 
\v 4 If thou wilt sende our brother with vs, we will goe downe, and bye thee foode: 
\v 5 But if thou wilt not send him, we wil not go downe: for the man said vnto vs, Looke me not in the face, except your brother be with you. 
\v 6 And Israel sayd, Wherefore delt ye so euill with me, as to tell the man, whether ye had yet a brother or no? 
\v 7 And they answered, The man asked straitly of our selues and of our kinred, saying, Is your father yet aliue? haue ye any brother? And wee tolde him according to these wordes: could we knowe certainely that he would say, Bring your brother downe? 
\v 8 Then sayde Iudah to Israel his father, Send the boy with mee, that we may rise and goe, and that we may liue and not dye, both we, and thou, and our children. 
\v 9 I wil be suertie for him: of mine hand shalt thou require him. If I bring him not to thee, and set him before thee, then let me beare the blame for euer. 
\v 10 For except we had made this tarying, doutlesse by this we had returned the second time. 
\v 11 Then their father Israel sayd vnto them, If it must needes be so now, do thus: take of the best fruites of the lande in your vessels, and bring the man a present, a little rosen, and a little hony, spices and myrrhe, nuttes, and almondes: 
\v 12 And take double money in your hande, and the money, that was brought againe in your sackes mouthes: cary it againe in your hand, lest it were some ouersight. 
\v 13 Take also your brother and arise, and go againe to the man. 
\v 14 And God almightie giue you mercie in the sight of the man, that hee may deliuer you your other brother, and Beniamin: but I shall be robbed of my childe, as I haue bene. 
\v 15 Thus the men tooke this present, and tooke twise so much money in their hande with Beniamin, and rose vp, and went downe to Egypt and stoode before Ioseph. 
\v 16 And whe Ioseph saw Beniamin with them, he sayde to his stewarde, Bring these men home and kill meate, and make ready: for the men shall eate with me at noone. 
\v 17 And the man did as Ioseph bad, and brought the men vnto Iosephs house. 
\v 18 Nowe when the men were brought into Iosephs house, they were afrayd, and sayd, Because of the money, that came in our sackes mouthes at the first time, are we brought, that hee may picke a quarrell against vs, and lay some thing to our charge, and bring vs in bondage and our asses. 
\v 19 Therefore came they to Iosephs stewarde, and communed with him at the doore of ye house. 
\v 20 And said, Oh syr, we came in deede down hither at the first time to bye foode, 
\v 21 And as wee came to an ynne and opened our sackes, behold, euery mans money was in his sackes mouth, euen our money in full weight, but we haue brought it againe in our handes. 
\v 22 Also other money haue we brought in our handes to bye foode, but we cannot tell, who put our money in our sackes. 
\v 23 And he said, Peace be vnto you, feare not: your God and the God of your father hath giuen you that treasure in your sackes, I had your money: and he brought forth Simeon to them. 
\v 24 So the man led them into Iosephs house, and gaue them water to wash their feete, and gaue their asses prouender. 
\v 25 And they made ready their present against Ioseph came at noone, (for they heard say, that they should eate bread there) 
\v 26 When Ioseph came home, they brought the present into the house to him, which was in their handes, and bowed downe to the grounde before him. 
\v 27 And he asked them of their prosperitie, and sayd, Is your father the olde man, of whome ye tolde me, in good health? is he yet aliue? 
\v 28 Who answered, Thy seruant our father is in good health, he is yet aliue: and they bowed downe, and made obeysance. 
\v 29 And he lifting vp his eyes, beheld his brother Beniamin his mothers sonne, and sayde, Is this your yonger brother, of whome ye tolde me? And he said, God be merciful vnto thee, my sone. 
\v 30 And Ioseph made haste (for his affection was inflamed towarde his brother, and sought where to weepe) and entred into his chamber, and wept there. 
\v 31 Afterward he washed his face, and came out, and refrained himselfe, and sayd, Set on meate. 
\v 32 And they prepared for him by himselfe, and for them by themselues, and for the Egyptians, which did eate with him, by themselues, because the Egyptians might not eate bread with the Ebrewes: for that was an abomination vnto the Egyptians. 
\v 33 So they sate before him: the eldest according vnto his age, and the yongest according vnto his youth. and the men marueiled among themselues. 
\v 34 And they tooke meases from before him, and sent to them: but Beniamins mease was fiue times so much as any of theirs: and they drunke, and had of the best drinke with him. 
\c 44  
\p
\v 1 Afterward he commanded his steward, saying, Fill the mens sackes with foode, as much as they can carry, and put euery mans money in his sackes mouth. 
\v 2 And put my cup, I meane the siluer cup, in the sackes mouth of the yongest, and his corne money. And he did according to the commandement that Ioseph gaue him. 
\v 3 And in the morning the men were sent away, they, and their asses. 
\v 4 And when they went out of the citie not farre off, Ioseph sayd to his stewarde, Vp, follow after the men: and when thou doest ouertake them, say vnto them, Wherefore haue ye rewarded euill for good? 
\v 5 Is that not the cuppe, wherein my Lord drinketh? and in the which he doeth deuine and prophecie? ye haue done euill in so doing. 
\v 6 And when he ouertooke them, he sayde those wordes vnto them. 
\v 7 And they answered him, Wherefore sayeth my lorde such wordes? God forbid that thy seruants should do such a thing. 
\v 8 Behold, the money which we found in our sackes mouthes, wee brought againe to thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steale out of thy lordes house siluer or golde? 
\v 9 With whomesoeuer of thy seruants it bee found, let him dye, and we also will be my lordes bondmen. 
\v 10 And he said, Now then let it be according vnto your wordes: he with whome it is found, shall be my seruant, and ye shalbe blamelesse. 
\v 11 Then at once euery man tooke downe his sacke to the grounde, and euery one opened his sacke. 
\v 12 And he searched, and began at the eldest and left at the yongest: and the cuppe was found in Beniamins sacke. 
\v 13 Then they rent their clothes, and laded euery man his asse, and went againe into the citie. 
\v 14 So Iudah and his brethren came to Iosephs house (for he was yet there) and they fel before him on the ground. 
\v 15 Then Ioseph sayd vnto them, What acte is this, which ye haue done? know ye not that such a man as I, can deuine and prophecie? 
\v 16 Then sayd Iudah, What shall we say vnto my lord? what shall we speake? and howe can we iustifie our selues? God hath found out the wickednesse of thy seruants: beholde, we are seruants to my Lord, both wee, and he, with whome the cuppe is founde. 
\v 17 But he answered, God forbid, that I should doe so, but the man, with whome the cuppe is founde, he shalbe my seruant, and go ye in peace vnto your father. 
\v 18 Then Iudah drewe neere vnto him, and sayde, O my Lord, let thy seruant nowe speake a worde in my lordes eares, and let not thy wrath be kindled against thy seruant: for thou art euen as Pharaoh. 
\v 19 My Lord asked his seruants, saying, Haue ye a father, or a brother? 
\v 20 And we answered my Lord, We haue a father that is olde, and a young childe, which he begate in his age: and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loueth him. 
\v 21 Now thou saidest vnto thy seruants, Bring him vnto me, that I may set mine eye vpon him. 
\v 22 And we answered my lord, The childe can not depart from his father: for if he leaue his father, his father would die. 
\v 23 Then saydest thou vnto thy seruants, Except your yonger brother come downe with you, looke in my face no more. 
\v 24 So when we came vnto thy seruant our father, and shewed him what my lord had sayd, 
\v 25 And our father sayde vnto vs, Goe againe, bye vs a litle foode, 
\v 26 Then we answered, We can not go downe: but if our yongest brother go with vs, then will we go downe: for we may not see the mans face, except our yongest brother be with vs. 
\v 27 Then thy seruant my father sayde vnto vs, Ye knowe that my wife bare me two sonnes, 
\v 28 And the one went out from me, and I said, Of a suretie he is torne in pieces, and I sawe him not since. 
\v 29 Nowe yee take this also away from me: if death take him, then yee shall bring my graye head in sorowe to the graue. 
\v 30 Nowe therefore, when I come to thy seruant my father, and the childe be not with vs (seeing that his life dependeth on the childes life) 
\v 31 Then when hee shall see that the childe is not come, he will die: so shall thy seruants bring the graye head of thy seruant our father with sorowe to the graue. 
\v 32 Doubtlesse thy seruant became suertie for the childe to my father, and said, If I bring him not vnto thee againe, then I will beare the blame vnto my father for euer. 
\v 33 Nowe therefore, I pray thee, let me thy seruant bide for the childe, as a seruant to my Lord, and let the childe go vp with his brethren. 
\v 34 For how can I go vp to my father, if the childe be not with me, vnlesse I woulde see the euil that shall come on my father? 
\c 45  
\p
\v 1 Then Ioseph could not refraine him selfe before all that stoode by him, but hee cryed, Haue forth euery man from me. And there taryed not one with him, while Ioseph vttered himselfe vnto his brethren. 
\v 2 And hee wept and cried, so that the Egyptians heard: the house of Pharaoh heard also. 
\v 3 Then Ioseph sayde to his brethren, I am Ioseph: doeth my father yet liue? But his brethren coulde not answere him, for they were astonished at his presence. 
\v 4 Againe, Ioseph sayde to his brethren, Come neere, I pray you, to mee. And they came neere. And he sayde, I am Ioseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt. 
\v 5 Nowe therefore be not sad, neither grieued with your selues, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you for your preseruation. 
\v 6 For nowe two yeeres of famine haue bene through ye land, and fiue yeeres are behind, wherein neither shalbe earing nor haruest. 
\v 7 Wherefore God sent me before you to preserue your posteritie in this land, and to saue you aliue by a great deliuerance. 
\v 8 Now the you sent not me hither, but God, who hath made mee a father vnto Pharaoh, and lorde of all his house, and ruler throughout all the land of Egypt. 
\v 9 Haste you and go vp to my father, and tel him, Thus saieth thy sonne Ioseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come downe to me, tary not. 
\v 10 And thou shalt dwel in ye land of Goshen, and shalt be neere me, thou and thy children, and thy childrens children, and thy sheepe, and thy beastes, and all that thou hast. 
\v 11 Also I will nourish thee there (for yet remaine fiue yeeres of famine) lest thou perish through pouertie, thou and thy houshold, and all that thou hast. 
\v 12 And behold, your eyes doe see, and the eyes of my brother Beniamin, that my mouth speaketh to you. 
\v 13 Therefore tel my father of al mine honour in Egypt, and of all that ye haue seene, and make haste, and bring my father hither. 
\v 14 Then hee fell on his brother Beniamins necke, and wept, and Beniamin wept on his necke. 
\v 15 Moreouer, he kissed all his brethren, and wept vpon them: and afterwarde his brethren talked with him. 
\v 16 And the tidinges came vnto Pharaohs house, so that they said, Iosephs brethre are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his seruants. 
\v 17 Then Pharaoh said vnto Ioseph, Say to thy brethren, This doe ye, lade your beastes and depart, go to the land of Canaan, 
\v 18 And take your father, and your houshoulds, and come to me, and I wil giue you the best of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eate of the fat of the land. 
\v 19 And I commaund thee, Thus doe ye, take you charets out of the lande of Egypt for your children, and for your wiues, and bring your father and come. 
\v 20 Also regarde not your stuffe: for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours. 
\v 21 And the children of Israel did so: and Ioseph gaue them charets according to the commandement of Pharaoh: hee gaue them vitaile also for the iourney. 
\v 22 He gaue them all, none except, change of raiment: but vnto Beniamin he gaue three hundreth pieces of siluer, and fiue sutes of raiment. 
\v 23 And vnto his father likewise hee sent ten hee asses laden with the best things of Egypt, and ten shee asses laden with wheate, and bread and meate for his father by the way. 
\v 24 So sent he his brethren away, and they departed: and he sayde vnto them, Fall not out by the way. 
\v 25 Then they went vp from Egypt, and came vnto the land of Canaan vnto Iaakob their father, 
\v 26 And tolde him, saying, Ioseph is yet aliue, and he also is gouernour ouer all the lande of Egypt, and Iaakobs heart failed: for he beleeued them not. 
\v 27 And they told him al the words of Ioseph, which he had said vnto the: but when he saw the charets, which Ioseph had sent to cary him, then the spirit of Iaakob their father reuiued. 
\v 28 And Israel said, I haue inough: Ioseph my sonne is yet aliue: I will go and see him yer I die. 
\c 46  
\p
\v 1 Then Israel tooke his iourney with all that he had, and came to Beer-sheba, and offered sacrifice vnto the God of his father Izhak. 
\v 2 And God spake vnto Israel in a vision by night, saying, Iaakob, Iaakob. Who answered, I am here. 
\v 3 Then hee sayde, I am God, the God of thy father, feare not to goe downe into Egypt: for I will there make of thee a great nation. 
\v 4 I wil go downe with thee into Egypt, and I will also bring thee vp againe, and Ioseph shall put his hand vpon thine eyes. 
\v 5 Then Iaakob rose vp from Beer-sheba: and the sonnes of Israel caried Iaakob their father, and their children, and their wiues in the charets, which Pharaoh had sent to cary him. 
\v 6 And they tooke their cattell and their goods, which they had gotten in the lande of Canaan, and came into Egypt, both Iaakob and all his seede with him, 
\v 7 His sonnes and his sonnes sonnes with him, his daughters and his sonnes daughters, and al his seede brought he with him into Egypt. 
\v 8 And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt, euen Iaakob and his sonnes: Reuben, Iaakobs first borne. 
\v 9 And the sonnes of Reuben: Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi. 
\v 10 And the sonnes of Simeon: Iemuel, and Iamin, and Ohad, and Iachin, and Zohar; and Shaul the sonne of a Canaanitish woman. 
\v 11 Also the sonnes of Leui: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 
\v 12 Also the sonnes of Iudah: Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and Zerah: (but Er and Onan died in ye land of Canaan) And the sonnes of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul. 
\v 13 Also the sonnes of Issachar: Tola, and Phuuah, and Iob, and Shimron. 
\v 14 Also the sonnes of Zebulun: Sered, and Elon, and Iahleel. 
\v 15 These bee the sonnes of Leah, which shee bare vnto Iaakob in Padan Aram, with his daughter Dinah. All the soules of his sonnes and his daughters were thirtie and three. 
\v 16 Also the sonnes of Gad: Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli. 
\v 17 Also the sonnes of Asher: Iimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and Serah their sister. And the sonnes of Beriah: Heber, and Malchiel. 
\v 18 These are the children of Zilpah, whome Laban gaue to Leah his daughter: and these shee bare vnto Iaakob, euen sixtene soules. 
\v 19 The sonnes of Rahel Iaakobs wife were Ioseph and Beniamin. 
\v 20 And vnto Ioseph in the lande of Egypt were borne Manasseh, and Ephraim, which Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah prince of On bare vnto him. 
\v 21 Also the sonnes of Beniamin: Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard. 
\v 22 These are the sonnes of Rahel, which were borne vnto Iaakob, fourteene soules in all. 
\v 23 Also the sonnes of Dan: Hushim. 
\v 24 Also the sonnes of Naphtali: Iahzeel, and Guni, and Iezer, and Shillem. 
\v 25 These are the sonnes of Bilhah, which Laban gaue vnto Rahel his daughter, and shee bare these to Iaakob, in all, seuen soules. 
\v 26 Al the soules, that came with Iaakob into Egypt, which came out of his loynes (beside Iaakobs sonnes wiues) were in the whole, three score and sixe soules. 
\v 27 Also the sonnes of Ioseph, which were borne him in Egypt, were two soules: so that al the soules of the house of Iaakob, which came into Egypt, are seuentie. 
\v 28 The he sent Iudah before him vnto Ioseph, to direct his way vnto Goshen, and they came into the land of Goshen. 
\v 29 Then Ioseph made ready his charet and went vp to Goshen to meete Israel his father, and presented himselfe vnto him and fel on his necke, and wept vpon his necke a good while. 
\v 30 And Israel sayde vnto Ioseph, Now let me die, since I haue seene thy face, and that thou art yet aliue. 
\v 31 Then Ioseph said to his brethren, and to his fathers house, I wil go vp and shew Pharaoh, and tell him, My brethren and my fathers house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come vnto me, 
\v 32 And the men are shepheardes, and because they are shepheardes, they haue brought their sheepe and their cattell, and all that they haue. 
\v 33 And if Pharaoh call you, and aske you, What is your trade? 
\v 34 Then ye shall say, Thy seruants are men occupied about cattell, from our childehood euen vnto this time, both we and our fathers: that yee may dwell in the lande of Goshen: for euery sheepe keeper is an abomination vnto the Egyptians. 
\c 47  
\p
\v 1 Then came Ioseph and tolde Pharaoh, and sayde, My father, and my brethren, and their sheepe, and their cattell, and all that they haue, are come out of the land of Canaan, and behold, they are in the land of Goshen. 
\v 2 And Ioseph tooke part of his brethren, euen fiue men, and presented them vnto Pharaoh. 
\v 3 Then Pharaoh said vnto his brethren, What is your trade? And they answered Pharaoh, Thy seruants are shepheards, both we and our fathers. 
\v 4 They sayde moreouer vnto Pharaoh, For to soiourne in ye lande are we come: for thy seruants haue no pasture for their sheepe, so sore is ye famine in the lande of Canaan. Nowe therefore, we pray thee, let thy seruants dwel in the land of Goshen. 
\v 5 Then spake Pharaoh to Ioseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come vnto thee. 
\v 6 The lande of Egypt is before thee: in the best place of the land make thy father and thy brethren dwel: let the dwel in the land of Goshen: and if thou knowest that there be men of actiuitie among them, make them rulers ouer my cattell. 
\v 7 Ioseph also brought Iaakob his father, and set him before Pharaoh. And Iaakob saluted Pharaoh. 
\v 8 Then Pharaoh sayde vnto Iaakob, Howe olde art thou? 
\v 9 And Iaakob sayd vnto Pharaoh, The whole time of my pilgrimage is an hundreth and thirty yeeres: fewe and euill haue the dayes of my life bene, and I haue not attayned vnto the yeeres of the life of my fathers, in the dayes of their pilgrimages. 
\v 10 And Iaakob tooke leaue of Pharaoh, and departed from the presence of Pharaoh. 
\v 11 And Ioseph placed his father, and his brethren, and gaue them possession in the lande of Egypt, in the best of the land, euen in the lande of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded. 
\v 12 And Ioseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his fathers houshold with bread, euen to the yong children. 
\v 13 Now there was no bread in all the land: for the famine was exceeding sore: so that the land of Egypt, and the land of Canaan were famished by reason of the famine. 
\v 14 And Ioseph gathered all the money, that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corne which they bought, and Ioseph layd vp the money in Pharaohs house. 
\v 15 So when money fayled in the lande of Egypt, and in the lande of Canaan, then all the Egyptians came vnto Ioseph, and sayde, Giue vs bread: for why should we dye before thee? for our money is spent. 
\v 16 Then saide Ioseph, Bring your cattell, and I will giue you for your cattell, if your money be spent. 
\v 17 So they brought their cattell vnto Ioseph, and Ioseph gaue them bread for the horses, and for the flockes of sheepe, and for the heards of cattel, and for the asses: so he fed them with bread for all their cattell that yeere. 
\v 18 But when the yeere was ended, they came vnto him the next yeere, and sayd vnto him, We will not hide from my lord, that since our money is spent, and my lord hath the heards of the cattel, there is nothing left in the sight of my lorde, but our bodies and our ground. 
\v 19 Why shall we perish in thy sight, both we, and our land? bye vs and our land for bread, and we and our land will be bonde to Pharaoh: therefore giue vs seede, that we may liue and not dye, and that the land go not to waste. 
\v 20 So Ioseph bought all the lande of Egypt for Pharaoh: for the Egyptians solde euery man his ground because the famine was sore vpon the: so the land became Pharaohs. 
\v 21 And he remoued the people vnto the cities, from one side of Egypt euen to the other. 
\v 22 Onely the lande of the Priestes bought he not: for the Priestes had an ordinarie of Pharaoh, and they did eate their ordinarie, which Pharaoh gaue them: wherefore they solde not their grounde. 
\v 23 Then Ioseph sayd vnto the people, Behold, I haue bought you this daye, and your lande for Pharaoh: lo, here is seede for you: sowe therefore the grounde. 
\v 24 And of the encrease ye shall giue the fifth part vnto Pharaoh, and foure partes shalbe yours for the seede of the fielde, and for your meate, and for them of your housholdes, and for your children to eate. 
\v 25 Then they answered, Thou hast saued our liues: let vs finde grace in the sight of my Lord, and we will be Pharaohs seruants. 
\v 26 Then Ioseph made it a lawe ouer the land of Egypt vnto this day, that Pharaoh should haue the fift part, except the land of the priests only, which was not Pharaohs. 
\v 27 And Israel dwelt in the lande of Egypt, in the countrey of Goshen: and they had their possessions therein, and grewe and multiplied exceedingly. 
\v 28 Moreouer, Iaakob liued in the lande of Egypt seuenteene yeeres, so that the whole age of Iaakob was an hundreth fourtie and seuen yeere. 
\v 29 Now when the time drewe neere that Israel must dye, he called his sonne Ioseph, and sayde vnto him, If I haue nowe founde grace in thy sight, put thine hand nowe vnder my thigh, and deale mercifully and truely with me: burie me not, I pray thee, in Egypt. 
\v 30 But when I shall sleepe with my fathers, thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury mee in their buryall. And he answered, I will doe as thou hast sayde. 
\v 31 The he said, Sweare vnto me. And he sware vnto him. And Israel worshipped towardes the beds head. 
\c 48  
\p
\v 1 Againe after this, one sayd to Ioseph, Loe, thy father is sicke: then hee tooke with him his two sonnes, Manasseh and Ephraim. 
\v 2 Also one told Iaakob, and said, Behold, thy sonne Ioseph is come to thee, and Israel tooke his strength vnto him and sate vpon the bed. 
\v 3 Then Iaakob sayde vnto Ioseph, God almightie appeared vnto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me. 
\v 4 And he sayde vnto me, Behold, I wil make thee fruitefull, and will multiplie thee, and will make a great number of people of thee, and will giue this lande vnto thy seede after thee for an euerlasting possession. 
\v 5 And now thy two sonnes, Manasseh and Ephraim, which are borne vnto thee in the lande of Egypt, before I came to thee into Egypt, shall be mine, as Reuben and Simeon are mine. 
\v 6 But the linage, which thou hast begotten after them, shalbe thine: they shall be called after the names of their brethren in their inheritance. 
\v 7 Nowe when I came from Padan, Rahel died vpon mine hande in the lande of Canaan, by the way when there was but halfe a dayes iourney of grounde to come to Ephrath: and I buryed her there in the way to Ephrath: the same is Beth-lehem. 
\v 8 Then Israel beheld Iosephs sonnes and sayd, Whose are these? 
\v 9 And Ioseph sayd vnto his father, They are my sonnes, which God hath giuen mee here. Then he sayd, I pray thee, bring them to me, that I may blesse them: 
\v 10 (For the eyes of Israel were dimme for age, so that hee coulde not well see) Then he caused them to come to him, and he kissed them and embraced them. 
\v 11 And Israel sayde vnto Ioseph, I had not thought to haue seene thy face: yet lo, God hath shewed me also thy seede. 
\v 12 And Ioseph tooke them away from his knees, and did reuerence downe to the ground. 
\v 13 Then tooke Ioseph them both, Ephraim in his right hand towarde Israels left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israels right hand, so he brought them vnto him. 
\v 14 But Israel stretched out his right hand, and layde it on Ephraims head, which was the yonger, and his left hande vpon Manassehs head (directing his handes of purpose) for Manasseh was the elder. 
\v 15 Also he blessed Ioseph and sayde, The God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Izhak did walke, the God, which hath fed me al my life long vnto this day, blesse thee. 
\v 16 The Angel, which hath deliuered me from all euill, blesse the children, and let my name be named vpon them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Izhak, that they may growe as fish into a multitude in the middes of the earth. 
\v 17 But when Ioseph sawe that his father layde his right hande vpon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he stayed his fathers hand to remooue it from Ephraims head to Manassehs head. 
\v 18 And Ioseph sayde vnto his father, Not so, my father, for this is the eldest: put thy right hand vpon his head. 
\v 19 But his father refused, and sayd, I know well, my sonne, I know well: he shalbe also a people, and he shalbe great likewise: but his yonger brother shalbe greater then he, and his seede shall be full of nations. 
\v 20 So he blessed them that day, and sayde, In thee Israel shall blesse, and say, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh. and he set Ephraim before Manasseh. 
\v 21 Then Israel said vnto Ioseph, Behold, I die, and God shall be with you, and bring you againe vnto the land of your fathers. 
\v 22 Moreouer, I haue giuen vnto thee one portion aboue thy brethren, which I gate out of the hand of the Amorite by my sworde and by my bowe. 
\c 49  
\p
\v 1 Then Iaakob called his sonnes, and sayde, Gather your selues together, that I may tell you what shall come to you in the last dayes. 
\v 2 Gather your selues together, and heare, ye sonnes of Iaakob, and hearken vnto Israel your father. 
\v 3 Reuben mine eldest sonne, thou art my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellencie of dignitie, and the excellencie of power: 
\v 4 Thou wast light as water: thou shalt not be excellent, because thou wentest vp to thy fathers bed: then diddest thou defile my bed, thy dignitie is gone. 
\v 5 Simeon and Leui, brethren in euill, the instruments of crueltie are in their habitations. 
\v 6 Into their secret let not my soule come: my glory, be not thou ioyned with their assembly: for in their wrath they slew a man, and in their selfe will they digged downe a wall. 
\v 7 Cursed be their wrath, for it was fierce, and their rage, for it was cruell: I will deuide them in Iaakob, and scatter them in Israel. 
\v 8 Thou Iudah, thy brethre shall praise thee: thine hande shalbe in the necke of thine enemies: thy fathers sonnes shall bowe downe vnto thee. 
\v 9 Iudah, as a Lions whelpe shalt thou come vp from the spoyle, my sonne. He shall lye downe and couche as a Lion, and as a Lionesse: Who shall stirre him vp? 
\v 10 The scepter shall not depart from Iudah, nor a Lawegiuer from betweene his feete, vntill Shiloh come, and the people shall be gathered vnto him. 
\v 11 He shall binde his Asse foale vnto ye vine, and his Asses colte vnto the best vine. hee shall wash his garment in wine, and his cloke in the blood of grapes. 
\v 12 His eyes shalbe red with wine, and his teeth white with milke. 
\v 13 Zebulun shall dwell by the sea side, and he shalbe an hauen for shippes: and his border shalbe vnto Zidon. 
\v 14 Issachar shalbe a strong asse, couching downe betweene two burdens: 
\v 15 And he shall see that rest is good, and that the land is pleasant, and he shall bow his shoulder to beare, and shalbe subiect vnto tribute. 
\v 16 Dan shall iudge his people as one of the tribes of Israel. 
\v 17 Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder by the path, byting the horse heeles, so that his rider shall fall backward. 
\v 18 O Lord, I haue waited for thy saluation. 
\v 19 Gad, an hoste of men shall ouercome him, but he shall ouercome at the last. 
\v 20 Concerning Asher, his bread shalbe fat, and he shall giue pleasures for a king. 
\v 21 Naphtali shalbe a hinde let goe, giuing goodly wordes. 
\v 22 Ioseph shalbe a fruitefull bough, euen a fruitful bough by the well side: the small boughs shall runne vpon the wall. 
\v 23 And the archers grieued him, and shotte against him and hated him. 
\v 24 But his bowe abode strong, and the hands of his armes were strengthened, by the handes of the mighty God of Iaakob, of whom was the feeder appointed, by the stone of Israel, 
\v 25 Euen by the God of thy father, who shall helpe thee, and by the almightie, who shall blesse thee with heauenly blessinges from aboue, with blessings of the deepe, that lyeth beneath, with blessings of the brestes, and of the wombe. 
\v 26 The blessings of thy father shalbe stronger then the blessings of mine elders: vnto the ende of the hilles of the worlde they shall be on the head of Ioseph, and on the top of the head of him that was separate from his brethren. 
\v 27 Beniamin shall rauine as a wolfe: in the morning he shall deuoure the pray, and at night he shall deuide the spoyle. 
\v 28 All these are the twelue tribes of Israel, and thus their father spake vnto them, and blessed them: euery one of them blessed hee with a seuerall blessing. 
\v 29 And he charged them and sayd vnto them, I am ready to be gathered vnto my people: burie mee with my fathers in the caue, that is in the fielde of Ephron the Hittite, 
\v 30 In the caue that is in the field of Machpelah besides Mamre in the land of Canaan: which caue Abraham bought with the fielde of Ephron the Hittite for a possession to burie in. 
\v 31 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife: there they buryed Izhak and Rebekah his wife: and there I buried Leah. 
\v 32 The purchase of the fielde and the caue that is therein, was bought of the children of Heth. 
\v 33 Thus Iaakob made an end of giuing charge to his sonnes, and plucked vp his feete into the bed and gaue vp the ghost, and was gathered to his people. 
\c 50  
\p
\v 1 Then Ioseph fell vpon his fathers face and wept vpon him, and kissed him. 
\v 2 And Ioseph commanded his seruantes the physicions, to enbaume his father, and the physicions enbaumed Israel. 
\v 3 So fourtie dayes were accomplished (for so long did the dayes of them that were enbaumed last) and the Egyptians bewayled him seuentie dayes. 
\v 4 And when the dayes of his mourning were past, Ioseph spake to the house of Pharaoh, saying, If I haue nowe found fauour in your eyes, speake, I pray you, in the eares of Pharaoh, and say, 
\v 5 My father made me sweare, saying, Loe, I die, bury me in my graue, which I haue made me in the land of Canaan: now therefore let me go, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I wil come againe. 
\v 6 Then Pharaoh said, Goe vp and bury thy father, as he made thee to sweare. 
\v 7 So Ioseph went vp to bury his father, and with him went all the seruants of Pharaoh, both the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt. 
\v 8 Likewise all the house of Ioseph, and his brethren, and his fathers house: onely their children, and their sheepe, and their cattell left they in the land of Goshen. 
\v 9 And there went vp with him both charets and horsemen: and they were an exceeding great company. 
\v 10 And they came to Goren Atad, which is beyond Iorden, and there they made a great and exceeding sore lamentation: and he mourned for his father seuen dayes. 
\v 11 And when the Canaanites the inhabitants of the lande sawe the mourning in Goren Atad, they sayde, This is a great mourning vnto the Egyptians: wherefore the name thereof was called Abel Mizraim, which is beyond Iorden. 
\v 12 So his sonnes did vnto him, according as he had commanded them: 
\v 13 For his sonnes caried him into the lande of Canaan, and buried him in the caue of the fielde of Machpelah, which caue Abraham bought with the fielde, to be a place to bury in, of Ephron the Hittite besides Mamre. 
\v 14 Then Ioseph returned into Egypt, he and his brethren, and al that went vp with him to bury his father, after that he had buried his father. 
\v 15 And when Iosephs brethren saw that their father was dead, they sayde, It may be that Ioseph will hate vs, and will pay vs againe all the euill, which we did vnto him. 
\v 16 Therefore they sent vnto Ioseph, saying, Thy father commanded before his death, saying, 
\v 17 Thus shall ye say vnto Ioseph, Forgiue now, I pray thee, the trespasse of thy brethren, and their sinne: for they rewarded thee euil. And nowe, we pray thee, forgiue the trespasse of the seruants of thy fathers God. And Ioseph wept, when they spake vnto him. 
\v 18 Also his brethren came vnto him, and fell downe before his face, and sayde, Beholde, we be thy seruants. 
\v 19 To whome Ioseph sayde, Feare not: for am not I vnder God? 
\v 20 When ye thought euill against mee, God disposed it to good, that he might bring to passe, as it is this day, and saue much people aliue. 
\v 21 Feare not nowe therefore, I will nourish you, and your children: and hee comforted them, and spake kindly vnto them. 
\v 22 So Ioseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his fathers house: and Ioseph liued an hundreth and tenne yeere. 
\v 23 And Ioseph saw Ephraims children, euen vnto the third generation: also the sonnes of Machir the sonne of Manasseh were brought vp on Iosephs knees. 
\v 24 And Ioseph sayd vnto his brethren, I am ready to dye, and God will surely visite you, and bring you out of this land, vnto ye land which hee sware vnto Abraham, vnto Izhak, and vnto Iaakob. 
\v 25 And Ioseph tooke an othe of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visite you, and ye shall cary my bones hence. 
\v 26 So Ioseph died, when he was an hundreth and ten yere olde: and they enbaumed him and put him in a chest in Egypt.
