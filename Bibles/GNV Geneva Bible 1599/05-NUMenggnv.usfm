\v 4 And with you shalbe men of euery tribe, such as are the heads of the house of their fathers.

\v 16 These were famous in the Congregation, princes of the tribes of their fathers, and heads ouer thousands in Israel. 
\v 17 The Moses and Aaron tooke these men which are expressed by their names. 
\v 18 And they called all the Congregation together, in the first day of the second moneth, who declared their kindreds by their families, and by the houses of their fathers, according to the nomber of their names, from twentie yere olde and aboue, man by man. 
\v 19 As the Lord had commanded Moses, so he nombred them in the wildernesse of Sinai. 
\v 20 So were the sonnes of Reuben Israels eldest sonne by their generations, by their families, and by the houses of their fathers, according to the nomber of their names, man by man euery male from twentie yere olde and aboue, as many as went forth to warre:

\v 34 Of the sonnes of Manasseh by their generations, by their families, and by the houses of their fathers, according to the nomber of their names, from twentie yeere olde and aboue, all that went foorth to warre:

\v 36 Of the sonnes of Beniamin by their generations, by their families, and by the houses of their fathers, according to the nomber of their names, from twentie yeere olde and aboue, all that went foorth to warre:

\v 44 These are the summes which Moses, and Aaron nombred, and the Princes of Israel, the twelue men, which were euery one for the house of their fathers. 
\v 45 So this was all the summe of the sonnes of Israel, by the houses of their fathers, from twenty yeere olde and aboue, all that went to the warre in Israel, 
\v 46 And all they were in nomber sixe hudreth and three thousande, fiue hundreth and fiftie. 
\v 47 But the Leuites, after the tribes of their fathers were not nombred among them. 
\v 48 For the Lord had spoken vnto Moses, and said, 
\v 49 Onely thou shalt not number the tribe of Leui, neither take the summe of them among the children of Israel: 
\v 50 But thou shalt appoynt the Leuites ouer the Tabernacle of the Testimonie, and ouer all the instruments thereof, and ouer all things that belong to it: they shall beare the Tabernacle, and all the instruments thereof, and shall minister in it, and shall dwell round about the Tabernacle. 
\v 51 And when the Tabernacle goeth forth, the Leuites shall take it downe: and when the Tabernacle is to be pitched, ye Leuites shall set it vp: for the stranger that commeth neere, shalbe slaine. 
\v 52 Also the children of Israel shall pitch their tentes, euery man in his campe, and euery man vnder his standerd throughout their armies. 
\v 53 But the Leuites shall pitch rounde about the Tabernacle of the Testimonie, least vengeance come vpon the Congregation of the children of Israel, and the Leuites shall take the charge of the Tabernacle of the Testimonie. 
\v 54 So the children of Israel did according to all that ye Lord had comanded Moses: so did they. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, and to Aaron, saying, 
\v 2 Euery man of the children of Israel shall campe by his standerd, and vnder the ensigne of their fathers house: farre off about the Tabernacle of the Congregation shall they pitch. 
\v 3 On the East side towarde the rising of the sunne, shall they of the standerd of the hoste of Iudah pitch according to their armies: and Nahshon the sonne of Amminadab shalbe captaine of the sonnes of Iudah.

\v 16 All the nomber of the campe of Reuben were an hundreth and one and fiftie thousande, and foure hundreth and fiftie according to their armies, and they shall set foorth in the seconde place. 
\v 17 Then the Tabernacle of the Congregation shall goe with the host of the Leuites, in the mids of the campe as they haue pitched, so shall they goe forwarde, euery man in his order according to their standerds. 
\v 18 The standerd of the campe of Ephraim shalbe toward the west according to their armies: and ye captaine ouer the sonnes of Ephraim shall be Elishama the sonne of Ammihud:

\v 28 And his host and the nomber of them were one and fourtie thousand and fiue hundreth. 
\v 29 Then the tribe of Naphtali, and the captaine ouer the children of Naphtali shall be Ahira the sonne of Enan:

\v 31 All the nomber of the host of Dan was an hundreth and seuen and fiftie thousand and sixe hundreth: they shall goe hinmost with their standerdes. 
\v 32 These are the summes of the childre of Israel by ye houses of their fathers, all the nomber of ye host, according to their armies, six hundreth and three thousand, fiue hundreth and fiftie. 
\v 33 But the Leuites were not nombred among the children of Israel, as the Lord had commanded Moses. 
\v 34 And the children of Israel did according to all that the Lord had commanded Moses: so they pitched according to their standards, and so they iourneyed euery one with his families, according to the houses of their fathers. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 These also were the generations of Aaron and Moses, in the day that the Lord spake with Moses in mount Sinai. 
\v 2 So these are the names of the sonnes of Aaron, Nadab the first borne, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 
\v 3 These are the names of the sonnes of Aaron the anoynted Priests, whom Moses did consecrate to minister in the Priests office. 
\v 4 And Nadab and Abihu died before the Lord, when they offred strange fire before the Lord in the wildernesse of Sinai, and had no children: but Eleazar and Ithamar serued in ye Priestes office in the sight of Aaron their father. 
\v 5 Then the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 6 Bring the tribe of Leui, and set the before Aaron the Priest that they may serue him, 
\v 7 And take the charge with him, euen the charge of the whole Congregation before the Tabernacle of the Congregation to doe the seruice of the Tabernacle. 
\v 8 They shall also keepe all the instruments of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and haue the charge of the children of Israel to doe the seruice of the Tabernacle. 
\v 9 And thou shalt giue the Leuites vnto Aaron and to his sonnes: for they are giuen him freely from among the children of Israel. 
\v 10 And thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sonnes to execute their Priestes office: and the stranger that commeth neere, shalbe slayne. 
\v 11 Also the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 12 Beholde, I haue euen taken the Leuites from among the childre of Israel: for al the first borne that openeth the matrice among the children of Israel, and the Leuites shalbe mine, 
\v 13 Because all the first borne are mine: for the same day, that I smote all the first borne in the land of Egypt, I sanctified vnto me all the first borne in Israel, both man and beast: mine they shalbe: I am the Lord. 
\v 14 Moreouer, the Lord spake vnto Moses in the wildernesse of Sinai, saying, 
\v 15 Nomber the children of Leui after the houses of their fathers, in their families: euery male from a moneth olde and aboue shalt thou nomber. 
\v 16 Then Moses nombred them according to the word of the Lord, as he was commanded. 
\v 17 And these are the sonnes of Leui by their names, Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari. 
\v 18 Also these are the names of the sonnes of Gershon by their families: Libni and Shimei. 
\v 19 The sonnes also of Kohath by their families: Amram, and Izehar, Hebron, and Vzziel. 
\v 20 And the sonnes of Merari by their families: Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of Leui, according to the houses of their fathers. 
\v 21 Of Gershon came the familie of the Libnites, and the familie of the Shimeites: these are the families of the Gershonites. 
\v 22 The summe whereof (after the nomber of all the males from a moneth olde and aboue) was counted seuen thousand and fiue hundreth. 
\v 23 The families of the Gershonites shall pitch behind the Tabernacle westward. 
\v 24 The captaine and auncient of the house of the Gershonites shalbe Eliasaph the sonne of Lael. 
\v 25 And the charge of the sonnes of Gershon in the Tabernacle of the Congregation shall be the Tabernacle, and the pauilion, the couering thereof, and the vaile of the dore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, 
\v 26 And the hanging of the court, and the vaile of the doore of the court, which is neere the Tabernacle, and neere ye Altar round about, and the cordes of it for all the seruice thereof. 
\v 27 And of Kohath came the familie of the Amramites, and the familie of the Izeharites, and the familie of the Hebronites, and the familie of the Vzzielites: these are the families of the Kohathites. 
\v 28 The nomber of all the males from a moneth olde and aboue was eight thousand and sixe hundreth, hauing the charge of the Sanctuarie. 
\v 29 The families of the sonnes of Kohath shall pitch on the Southside of the Tabernacle. 
\v 30 The captaine and auncient of the house, and families of the Kohathites shall be Elizaphan the sonne of Vzziel: 
\v 31 And their charge shalbe the Arke, and the Table, and the Candlesticke, and the altars, and the instruments of the Sanctuarie that they minister with, and the vaile, and all that serueth thereto. 
\v 32 And Eleazar the sonne of Aaron the Priest shalbe chiefe captaine of the Leuites, hauing the ouersight of them that haue the charge of the Sanctuarie. 
\v 33 Of Merari came the familie of the Mahlites, and the familie of the Mushites: these are the families of Merari. 
\v 34 And the summe of them, according to the nomber of all the males, from a moneth olde and aboue was sixe thousand and two hundreth. 
\v 35 The captaine and the ancient of the house of the families of Merari shalbe Zuriel the sonne of Abihail: they shall pitche on the Northside of the Tabernacle. 
\v 36 And in ye charge and custodie of the sonnes of Merari shall be the boardes of the Tabernacle, and the barres thereof, and his pillars, and his sockets, and al the instruments therof, and al that serueth thereto, 
\v 37 With the pillars of the court round about, with their sockets, and their pins and their coardes. 
\v 38 Also on the forefront of the Tabernacle toward the East, before the Tabernacle, I say, of the Congregation Eastwarde shall Moses and Aaron and his sonnes pitch, hauing the charge of the Sanctuarie, and the charge of the children of Israel: but the stranger that commeth neere, shall be slayne. 
\v 39 The wholesumme of ye Leuites, which Moses and Aaron nombred at the commandement of the Lord throughout their families, euen al the males from a moneth olde and aboue, was two and twentie thousand. 
\v 40 And the Lord said vnto Moses, Nomber all the first borne that are Males among the children of Israel, from a moneth old and aboue, and take the nomber of their names. 
\v 41 And thou shalt take ye Leuites to me for all the first borne of the children of Israel (I am the Lord) and the cattell of the Leuites for all the first borne of the cattell of the children of Israel. 
\v 42 And Moses nombred, as the Lord commanded him, all the first borne of the children of Israel. 
\v 43 And all the first borne males rehearsed by name (from a moneth olde and aboue) according to their nomber were two and twentie thousand, two hundreth seuentie and three. 
\v 44 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 45 Take the Leuites for all the first borne of the children of Israel, and the cattell of the Leuites for their cattel, and the Leuites shalbe mine, (I am the Lord) 
\v 46 And for the redeeming of the two hundreth seuentie and three, (which are moe then the Leuites) of the first borne of the children of of Israel, 
\v 47 Thou shalt also take fiue shekels for euery person: after the weight of the Sanctuarie shalt thou take it: ye shekel conteineth twenty gerahs. 
\v 48 And thou shalt giue the money, wherwith the odde nomber of them is redeemed, vnto Aaron and to his sonnes. 
\v 49 Thus Moses tooke the redemption of the that were redeemed, being more then the Leuites: 
\v 50 Of the first borne of the children of Israel tooke he the mony: eue a thousand three hundreth three score and fiue shekels after the shekel of the Sanctuarie. 
\v 51 And Moses gaue the money of them that were redeemed, vnto Aaron and to his sonnes according to the word of the Lord, as the Lord had commanded Moses. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, and to Aaron, saying, 
\v 2 Take the summe of the sonnes of Kohath from among the sonnes of Leui, after their families, and houses of their fathers, 
\v 3 From thirtie yeere olde and aboue, euen vntill fiftie yeere olde, all that enter into the assemblie to do the worke in the Tabernacle of the Congregation. 
\v 4 This shall be the office of the sonnes of Kohath in the Tabernacle of the Congregation about the Holiest of all. 
\v 5 When the hoste remoueth, then Aaron and his sonnes shall come and take downe the couering vaile, and shall couer the Arke of the Testimonie therewith. 
\v 6 And they shall put thereon a couering of badgers skinnes, and shall spread vpon it a cloth altogether of blewe silke, and put to the barres thereof: 
\v 7 And vpon ye table of shew bread they shall spread a cloth of blewe silke, and put thereon the dishes, and the incense cups, and goblets, and couerings to couer it with, and the bread shall be thereon continually: 
\v 8 And they shall spread vpon them a couering of skarlet, and couer the same with a couering of badgers skinnes, and put to the barres thereof. 
\v 9 Then they shall take a cloth of blewe silke, and couer the candlesticke of light with his lampes and his snuffers, and his snuffedishes, and al the oyle vessels thereof, which they occupie about it. 
\v 10 So they shall put it, and all the instruments thereof in a couering of badgers skinnes, and put it vpon the barres. 
\v 11 Also vpon the golden altar they shall spread a cloth of blewe silke, and couer it with a couering of badgers skinnes, and put to the barres thereof. 
\v 12 And they shall take all the instruments of the ministerie wherewith they minister in the Sanctuarie, and put them in a cloth of blew silke, and couer the with a couering of badgers skinnes, and put them on the barres. 
\v 13 Also they shall take away the ashes from the altar, and spread a purple cloth vpon it,

\v 15 And when Aaron and his sonnes haue made an ende of couering the Sanctuarie, and al the instruments of the Sanctuarie, at the remouing of the host, afterward the sonnes of Kohath shall come to beare it, but they shall not touch any holy thing, lest they dye. This is the charge of the sonnes of Kohath in the Tabernacle of the Congregation. 
\v 16 And to the office of Eleazar the sonne of Aaron the Priest pertaineth the oyle for the light, and the sweete incense and the dayly meat offring, and the anointing oyle, with the ouersight of all the Tabernacle, and of all that therein is, both in the Sanctuarie and in all the instruments thereof. 
\v 17 And the Lord spake vnto Moses and to Aaron, saying, 
\v 18 Ye shall not cut off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from among the Leuites: 
\v 19 But thus do vnto them, that they may liue and not die, when they come neere to the most holy things: let Aaron and his sonnes come and appoynt them, euery one to his office, and to his charge. 
\v 20 But let them not goe in, to see when the Sanctuarie is folden vp, lest they die. 
\v 21 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 22 Take also ye summe of the sonnes of Gershon, euery one by the houses of their fathers throughout their families: 
\v 23 From thirtie yere old and aboue, vntil fiftie yere old shalt thou nomber them, al that enter into the assemblie for to do seruice in the Tabernacle of the Congregation. 
\v 24 This shall be the seruice of the families of the Gershonites, to serue and to beare. 
\v 25 They shall beare the curtaines of the Tabernacle, and the Tabernacle of the Congregation, his couering, and the couering of badgers skinnes, that is on hie vpon it, and the vayle of the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation: 
\v 26 The curtaines also of the court, and the vaile of the entring in of the gate of the court, which is neere the Tabernacle and neere the altar round about, with their cordes, and all the instruments for their seruice, and all that is made for them: so shall they serue. 
\v 27 At the commandement of Aaron and his sonnes shall all the seruice of the sonnes of ye Gershonites bee done, in all their charges and in all their seruice, and ye shall appoynt them to keepe all their charges. 
\v 28 This is the seruice of the families of the sonnes of the Gershonites in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and their watch shall be vnder the hande of Ithamar the sonne of Aaron the Priest. 
\v 29 Thou shalt nomber the sonnes of Merari by their families, and by the houses of their fathers: 
\v 30 From thirty yere olde and aboue, euen vnto fiftie yere olde shalt thou nomber the, all that enter into the assemblie, to doe the seruice of the Tabernacle of the Congregation. 
\v 31 And this is their office and charge according to all their seruice in the Tabernacle of the Congregation: the boardes of the Tabernacle with the barres thereof, and his pillars, and his sockets, 
\v 32 And the pillars rounde about the court, with their sockets and their pinnes, and their cords, with all their instruments, euen for all their seruice: and by name ye shall recken the instruments of their office and charge. 
\v 33 This is the seruice of the families of the sonnes of Merari, according to all their seruice in the Tabernacle of the Congregation vnder the hand of Ithamar the sonne of Aaron the Priest. 
\v 34 Then Moses and Aaron and the princes of the Congregation nombred the sonnes of the Kohathites, by their families and by the houses of their fathers, 
\v 35 From thirtie yeere olde and aboue, euen vnto fiftie yere olde, all that enter into the assemblie for the seruice of the Tabernacle of ye Congregation. 
\v 36 So the nombers of the throughout their families were two thousande, seuen hundreth and fiftie. 
\v 37 These are the nombers of the families of the Kohathites, al that serue in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, which Moses and Aaron did nomber according to the commandement of the Lord by the hand of Moses. 
\v 38 Also the nombers of the sonnes of Gershon throughout their families and houses of their fathers, 
\v 39 From thirtie yere olde and vpwarde, euen vnto fiftie yere olde: all that enter into the assemblie for the seruice of the Tabernacle of the Cogregation. 
\v 40 So the nombers of them by their families, and by the houses of their fathers were two thousand sixe hundreth and thirtie. 
\v 41 These are the nombers of the families of the sonnes of Gershon: of all that did seruice in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, whom Moses and Aaron did nomber according to the commandement of the Lord. 
\v 42 The nombers also of the families of the sonnes of Merari by their families, and by the houses of their fathers, 
\v 43 From thirtie yeere olde and vpwarde, euen vnto fiftie yeere olde: all that enter into the assemblie for the seruice of the Tabernacle of the Congregation. 
\v 44 So the nombers of them by their families were three thousand, and two hundreth. 
\v 45 These are the summes of ye families of the sonnes of Merari, whom Moses and Aaron nombred according to the commandement of the Lord, by the hand of Moses. 
\v 46 So all the nombers of the Leuites, which Moses, and Aaron, and the princes of Israel nombred by their families and by the houses of their fathers, 
\v 47 From thirtie yere olde and vpward, euen to fiftie yeere olde, euery one that came to doe his duetie, office, seruice and charge in the Tabernacle of the Congregation. 
\v 48 So the nombers of them were eight thousand, fiue hundreth and foure score. 
\v 49 According to the commandement of the Lord by the hand of Moses did Aaron nomber them, euery one according to his seruice, and according to his charge. Thus were they of that tribe nombred, as the Lord commanded Moses. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Commaund the children of Israel that they put out of the hoste euery leper, and euery one that hath an issue, and whosoeuer is defiled by the dead. 
\v 3 Both male and female shall ye put out: out of the hoste shall yee put them, that they defile not their tentes among whome I dwell. 
\v 4 And the children of Israel did so, and put them out of the host, euen as the Lord had commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel. 
\v 5 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 6 Speake vnto the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall commit any sinne that men commit, and transgresse against the Lord, when that person shall trespasse, 
\v 7 Then they shall confesse their sinne which they haue done, and shall restore the domage thereof with his principall, and put the fift part of it more thereto, and shall giue it vnto him, against whom he hath trespassed. 
\v 8 But if the man haue no kinseman, to whom he shoulde restore the domage, the domage shall be restored to the Lord for the Priests vse besides the ramme of the atonement, whereby hee shall make atonement for him. 
\v 9 And euery offring of all the holy thinges of the children of Israel, which they bring vnto the Priest, shalbe his. 
\v 10 And euery mans halowed things shall bee his: that is, whatsoeuer any man giueth the Priest, it shalbe his. 
\v 11 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 12 Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say vnto them, If any mans wife turne to euill, and commit a trespasse against him, 
\v 13 So that an other man lie with her fleshly, and it bee hid from the eyes of her husband, and kept close, and yet she be defiled, and there be no witnesse against her, neither she taken with the maner, 
\v 14 If he be moued with a ielous minde, so that he is ielous ouer his wife, which is defiled, or if he haue a ielous minde, so that he is ielous ouer his wife, which is not defiled, 
\v 15 Then shall the man bring his wife to the Priest, and bring her offering with her, the tenth part of an Ephah of barly meale, but he shall not powre oyle vpon it, nor put incense thereon: for it is an offring of ielousie, an offring for a remembrance, calling the sinne to minde: 
\v 16 And the Priest shall bring her, and set her before the Lord. 
\v 17 Then the Priest shall take the holy water in an earthen vessel, and of the dust that is in the floore of the Tabernacle, euen the Priest shall take it and put it into the water. 
\v 18 After, the Priest shall set the woman before the Lord, and vncouer the womans head, and put the offring of the memorial in her hands: it is the ielousie offering, and the Priest shall haue bitter and cursed water in his hand, 
\v 19 And the Priest shall charge her by an othe, and say vnto the woman, If no man haue lien with thee, neither thou hast turned to vncleannesse from thine husband, be free from this bitter and cursed water. 
\v 20 But if thou hast turned from thine husband, and so art defiled, and some man hath lyen with thee beside thine husband, 
\v 21 (Then the Priest shall charge the woman with an othe of cursing, and the Priest shall say vnto the woman) The Lord make thee to be accursed, and detestable for the othe among thy people, and the Lord cause thy thigh to rot, and thy belly to swell: 
\v 22 And that this cursed water may goe into thy bowels, to cause thy belly to swell, and thy thigh to rot. Then the woman shall answere, Amen, Amen. 
\v 23 After, the Priest shall write these curses in a booke, and shall blot them out with the bitter water, 
\v 24 And shall cause the woman to drinke ye bitter and cursed water, and the cursed water, turned into bitternesse, shall enter into her. 
\v 25 Then the Priest shall take the ielousie offring out of the womans hand, and shall shake the offring before the Lord, and offer it vpon ye altar. 
\v 26 And the Priest shall take an handfull of the offring for a memorial thereof, and burne it vpon the altar, and afterwarde make the woman drinke the water. 
\v 27 When yee haue made her drinke the water, (if she bee defiled and haue trespassed against her husband) then shall the cursed water, turned into bitternesse, enter into her, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall rot, and the woman shall be accursed among her people. 
\v 28 But if the woman bee not defiled, but bee cleane, she shalbe free and shall conceiue and beare. 
\v 29 This is the law of ielousie, when a wife turneth from her husband and is defiled, 
\v 30 Or when a man is moued with a ielous minde being ielous ouer his wife then shall he bring the woman before the Lord, and the Priest shall do to her according to al this lawe, 
\v 31 And the man shalbe free from sinne, but this woman shall beare her iniquitie.

\v 1 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say vnto them, When a man or a woman doeth separate themselues to vowe a vowe of a Nazarite to separate himselfe vnto the Lord, 
\v 3 He shall abstaine from wine and strong drinke, and shall drinke no sowre wine nor sowre drinke, nor shall drinke any licour of grapes, neither shall eate fresh grapes nor dryed. 
\v 4 As long as his abstinence endureth, shall hee eat nothing that is made of the wine of the vine, neither the kernels, nor the huske. 
\v 5 While hee is separate by his vowe, the rasor shall not come vpon his head, vntill the dayes be out, in the which he separateth him selfe vnto the Lord, he shalbe holy, and shall let the lockes of the heare of his head growe. 
\v 6 During the time that he separateth himselfe vnto the Lord, he shall come at no dead body: 
\v 7 Hee shall not make himselfe vncleane at the death of his father, or mother, brother, or sister: for the consecration of his God is vpon his head. 
\v 8 All the dayes of his separation he shalbe holy to the Lord. 
\v 9 And if any dye suddenly by him, or hee beware, then the head of his consecration shall be defiled, and he shall shaue his head in the day of his clensing: in the seuenth day he shall shaue it. 
\v 10 And in the eight day hee shall bring two turtles, or two yong pigeons to the Priest, at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation. 
\v 11 Then the Priest shall prepare the one for a sinne offering, and the other for a burnt offering, and shall make an atonement for him, because he sinned by the dead: so shall he halowe his head the same day, 
\v 12 And he shall consecrate vnto the Lord the dayes of his separation, and shall bring a lambe of a yeere olde for a trespasse offering, and the first dayes shalbe voide: for his consecration was defiled. 
\v 13 This then is the lawe of the Nazarite: When the time of his consecration is out, he shall come to the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, 
\v 14 And hee shall bring his offering vnto the Lord, an hee lambe of a yeere olde without blemish for a burnt offering, and a shee lambe of a yere olde without blemish for a sinne offring, and a ramme without blemish for peace offrings, 
\v 15 And a basket of vnleauened bread, of cakes of fine floure, mingled with oyle, and wafers of vnleauened bread anointed with oile, with their meate offring, and their drinke offrings: 
\v 16 The which the Priest shall bring before the Lord, and make his sinne offering and his burnt offering. 
\v 17 He shall prepare also the ram for a peace offring vnto the Lord, with the basket of vnleauened bread, and the Priest shall make his meate offring, and his drinke offring. 
\v 18 And the Nazarite shall shaue the head of his consecration at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and shall take the heare of the head of his consecration, and put it in the fire, which is vnder the peace offring. 
\v 19 Then the Priest shall take ye sodden shoulder of the ramme, and an vnleauened cake out of the basket, and a wafer vnleauened, and put them vpon the hands of the Nazarite, after he hath shauen his consecration. 
\v 20 And the Priest shall shake them to and from before the Lord: this is an holy thing for the Priest besides the shaken breast, and besides the heaue shoulder: so afterwarde the Nazarite may drinke wine. 
\v 21 This is the Lawe of the Nazarite, which he hath vowed, and of his offering vnto the Lord for his consecration, besides that that hee is able to bring: according to the vowe which he vowed, so shall he do after the lawe of his consecration. 
\v 22 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 23 Speake vnto Aaron and to his sonnes, saying, Thus shall ye blesse the childre of Israel, and say vnto them, 
\v 24 The Lord blesse thee, and keepe thee, 
\v 25 The Lord make his face shine vpon thee, and be merciful vnto thee, 
\v 26 The Lord lift vp his coutenance vpon thee, and giue thee peace. 
\v 27 So they shall put my Name vpon the children of Israel, and I wil blesse them.

\v 1 Nowe when Moses had finished the setting vp of the Tabernacle, and anointed it and sanctified it, and all the instruments thereof, and the altar with al the instruments thereof, and had anoynted them and sanctified them, 
\v 2 Then the princes of Israel, heads ouer the houses of their fathers (they were the princes of the tribes, who were ouer them that were nombred) offred, 
\v 3 And brought their offring before the Lord, sixe couered charets, and twelue oxen: one charet for two princes, and for euery one an oxe, and they offred them before the Tabernacle. 
\v 4 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 5 Take these of them, that they may be to doe the seruice of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and thou shalt giue them vnto the Leuites, to euery man according vnto his office. 
\v 6 So Moses tooke the charets and the oxen, and gaue them vnto the Leuites: 
\v 7 Two charets and foure oxen hee gaue to the sonnes of Gershon, according vnto their office. 
\v 8 And foure charets and eight oxen hee gaue to the sonnes of Merari according vnto their office, vnder the hand of Ithamar the sonne of Aaron the Priest. 
\v 9 But to the sonnes of Kohath he gaue none, because the charge of the Sanctuarie belonged to them, which they did beare vpon their shoulders. 
\v 10 The princes also offered in the dedication for the altar in the day that it was anoynted: then the princes offered their offering before the altar. 
\v 11 And the Lord sayd vnto Moses, One prince one day, and an other prince an other day shall offer their offring, for the dedication of the altar.

\c 8  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Speake vnto Aaron, and say vnto him, When thou lightest the lampes, the seuen lampes shall giue light towarde the forefront of the Candlesticke. 
\v 3 And Aaron did so, lighting the lampes thereof towarde ye forefront of the Candlesticke, as the Lord had commanded Moses. 
\v 4 And this was the worke of the Candlesticke, euen of golde beaten out with the hammer, both the shafte, and the flowres thereof was beaten out with the hammer: according to the paterne, which the Lord had shewed Moses, so made he the Candlesticke. 
\v 5 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 6 Take the Leuites from among the children of Israel, and purifie them. 
\v 7 And thus shalt thou doe vnto them, when thou purifiest them, Sprinckle water of purification vpon them, and let them shaue all their flesh, and wash their clothes: so they shalbe cleane. 
\v 8 Then they shall take a yong bullocke with his meate offring of fine floure, mingled with oyle, and another yong bullocke shalt thou take for a sinne offring. 
\v 9 Then thou shalt bring the Leuites before the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and asseble all the Congregation of the children of Israel. 
\v 10 Thou shalt bring the Leuites also before the Lord, and the children of Israel shall put their handes vpon the Leuites. 
\v 11 And Aaron shall offer the Leuites before the Lord, as a shake offring of ye childre of Israel, that they may execute the seruice of the Lord. 
\v 12 And the Leuites shall put their handes vpon the heades of the bullockes, and make thou the one a sinne offring, and the other a burnt offring vnto the Lord, that thou mayest make an atonement for the Leuites. 
\v 13 And thou shalt set the Leuites before Aaron and before his sonnes, and offer the as a shake offring to the Lord. 
\v 14 Thus thou shalt separate the Leuites from among the children of Israel, and the Leuites shall be mine. 
\v 15 And afterwarde shall the Leuites goe in, to serue in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and thou shalt purifie them and offer them, as a shake offering. 
\v 16 For they are freely giuen vnto me from among the children of Israel, for such as open any wombe: for all the first borne of the children of Israel haue I taken them vnto me. 
\v 17 For all the first borne of the children of Israel are mine, both of man and of beast: since the day that I smote euery first borne in the land of Egypt, I sanctified them for my selfe. 
\v 18 And I haue taken the Leuites for all the first borne of the children of Israel, 
\v 19 And haue giuen the Leuites as a gift vnto Aaron, and to his sonnes from among the children of Israel, to do the seruice of the children of Israel in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and to make an atonement for the children of Israel, that there be no plague among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel come neere vnto the Sanctuarie. 
\v 20 Then Moses and Aaron and all the Cogregation of the children of Israel did with the Leuites, according vnto all that the Lord had commanded Moses concerning the Leuites: so did the children of Israel vnto them. 
\v 21 So the Leuites were purified, and washed their clothes, and Aaron offred them as a shake offring before the Lord, and Aaron made an atonement for them, to purifie them. 
\v 22 And after that, went the Leuites in to doe their seruice in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, before Aaron and before his sonnes: as the Lord had commanded Moses concerning the Leuites, so they did vnto them. 
\v 23 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 24 This also belongeth to the Leuites: from fiue and twentie yeere olde and vpwarde, they shall goe in, to execute their office in the seruice of the Tabernacle of the Congregation. 
\v 25 And after the age of fiftie yeere, they shall cease from executing the office, and shall serue no more: 
\v 26 But they shall minister with their brethre in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, to keepe things committed to their charge, but they shall doe no seruice: thus shalt thou doe vnto the Leuites touching their charges. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spake vnto Moses in the wildernes of Sinai, in the first moneth of the second yeere, after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying, 
\v 2 The children of Israel shall also celebrate the Passeouer at ye time appointed thereunto. 
\v 3 In the fourtenth day of this moneth at euen, ye shall keepe it in his due season: according to all the ordinances of it, and according to all the ceremonies thereof shall ye keepe it. 
\v 4 Then Moses spake vnto the children of Israel, to celebrate the Passeouer. 
\v 5 And they kept the Passeouer in the fouretenth day of the first moneth at euen in the wildernesse of Sinai: according to all that the Lord had comanded Moses, so did ye children of Israel. 
\v 6 And certaine men were defiled by a dead man, that they might not keepe the Passeouer the same day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron the same day. 
\v 7 And those men said vnto him, We are defiled by a dead man: wherefore are wee kept backe that we may not offer an offering vnto the Lord in the time thereunto appointed among the children of Israel? 
\v 8 Then Moses saide vnto them, Stande still, and I will heare what the Lord will commande concerning you. 
\v 9 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 10 Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say, If any amog you, or of your posteritie shalbe vncleane by ye reason of a corps, or be in a log iourney, he shall keepe the Passeouer vnto ye Lord. 
\v 11 In the fourtenth day of the second moneth at euen they shall keepe it: with vnleauened bread and sowre herbes shall they eate it. 
\v 12 They shall leaue none of it vnto the morning, nor breake any bone of it: according to all the ordinance of the Passeouer shall they keepe it. 
\v 13 But the man that is cleane and is not in a iourney, and is negligent to keepe the Passeouer, the same person shalbe cut off from his people: because he brought not the offring of the Lord in his due season, that man shall beare his sinne. 
\v 14 And if a stranger dwell among you, and wil keepe the Passeouer vnto the Lord, as the ordinance of the Passeouer, and as the maner thereof is, so shall he do: ye shall haue one lawe both for the stranger, and for him that was borne in the same lande. 
\v 15 And when the Tabernacle was reared vp, a cloude couered the Tabernacle, namely the Tabernacle of the Testimonie: and at euen there was vpon the Tabernacle, as the appearance of fire vntill the morning. 
\v 16 So it was alway: the cloude couered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night. 
\v 17 And when the cloude was taken vp from the Tabernacle, then afterwarde the children of Israel iourneyed: and in the place where the cloude abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents. 
\v 18 At the commandement of the Lord the children of Israel iourneyed, and at the comandement of the Lord they pitched: as long as the cloude abode vpon the Tabernacle, they lay still. 
\v 19 And when the cloude taryed stil vpon the Tabernacle a long time, the childre of Israel kept the watch of the Lord, and iourneyed not. 
\v 20 So when the cloud abode a few dayes vpon the Tabernacle, they abode in their tents according to the comandement of ye Lord: for they iourneyed at the commandement of the Lord. 
\v 21 And though the cloud abode vpon the Tabernacle from euen vnto the morning, yet if the cloude was taken vp in the morning, then they iourneyed: whether by daye or by night the cloude was taken vp, then they iourneyed. 
\v 22 Or if the cloude taryed two dayes or a moneth, or a yeere vpon the Tabernacle, abiding thereon, the children of Israel abode still, and iourneyed not: but when it was taken vp, they iourneyed. 
\v 23 At the commandement of the Lord they pitched, and at the commandement of the Lord they iourneyed, keeping the watch of the Lord at the commandement of the Lord by the hand of Moses. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Make thee two trumpets of siluer: of an whole piece shalt thou make the, that thou mayest vse them for the assembling of the Congregation, and for the departure of the campe. 
\v 3 And when they shall blowe with them, all the Congregation shall assemble to thee before the doore of the Tabernacle of the Cogregation. 
\v 4 But if they blowe with one, then the princes, or heades ouer the thousandes of Israel shall come vnto thee. 
\v 5 But if ye blow an alarme, then the campe of the that pitch on the East part, shall go forward. 
\v 6 If ye blowe an alarme the second time, then the hoste of them that lie on the Southside shall march: for they shall blowe an alarme when they remoue. 
\v 7 But in assembling the Congregation, ye shall blowe without an alarme. 
\v 8 And the sonnes of Aaron the Priest shall blowe the trumpets, and ye shall haue them as a lawe for euer in your generations. 
\v 9 And when ye goe to warre in your lande against the enemie that vexeth you, ye shall blowe an alarme with the trumpets, and ye shall bee remembred before the Lord your God, and shalbe saued from your enemies. 
\v 10 Also in the day of your gladnesse, and in your feast dayes, and in the beginning of your moneths, ye shall also blow the trumpets ouer your burnt sacrifices, and ouer your peace offrings, that they may be a remembrance for you before your God: I am the Lord your God. 
\v 11 And in the seconde yeere, in the seconde moneth, and in the twentieth day of the moneth the cloude was taken vp from the Tabernacle of the Testimonie. 
\v 12 And ye children of Israel departed on their iourneys out of the desart of Sinai, and the cloud rested in the wildernesse of Paran. 
\v 13 So they first tooke their iourney at the comandement of the Lord, by ye hand of Moses. 
\v 14 In the first place went the standerd of the hoste of the children of Iudah, according to their armies: and Nahshon the sonne of Amminabad was ouer his band. 
\v 15 And ouer the band of the tribe of the children of Issachar was Nethaneel ye sonne of Zuar. 
\v 16 And ouer the band of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab the sonne of Helon. 
\v 17 When the Tabernacle was taken downe, then the sonnes of Gershon, and the sonnes of Merari went forward bearing the Tabernacle. 
\v 18 After, departed the standerd of the hoste of Reuben, according to their armies, and ouer his band was Elizur the sonne of Shedeur. 
\v 19 And ouer the band of the tribe of ye children of Simeon was Shelumiel the sonne of Shurishaddai. 
\v 20 And ouer the bande of the tribe of ye children of Gad was Eliasaph the sonne of Deuel. 
\v 21 The Kohathites also went forward and bare the Sanctuarie, and the former did set vp the Tabernacle against they came. 
\v 22 Then the standerd of the hoste of the children of Ephraim went forward according to their armies, and ouer his bande was Elishama the sonne of Ammiud. 
\v 23 And ouer the band of the tribe of ye sonnes of Manasseh was Gamliel the sonne of Pedazur. 
\v 24 And ouer the band of ye tribe of the sonnes of Beniamin was Abidan the sonne of Gideoni. 
\v 25 Last, the standerd of the hoste of the children of Dan marched, gathering all ye hostes according to their armies: and ouer his bande was Ahiezer the sonne of Ammishaddai. 
\v 26 And ouer the bande of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel the sonne of Ocran. 
\v 27 And ouer the bande of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira ye sonne of Enan. 
\v 28 These were the remouings of the children of Israel according to their armies, whe they marched. 
\v 29 After, Moses said vnto Hobab ye sonne of Reuel the Midianite, ye father in law of Moses, We go into the place, of which ye Lord said, I will giue it you: Come thou with vs, and we wil doe thee good: for ye Lord hath promised good vnto Israel. 
\v 30 And he answered him, I will not goe: but I will depart to mine owne countrey, and to my kindred. 
\v 31 Then he sayd, I pray thee, leaue vs not: for thou knowest our camping places in the wildernesse: therefore thou mayest be our guide. 
\v 32 And if thou go with vs, what goodnes the Lord shall shew vnto vs, the same will we shewe vnto thee. 
\v 33 So they departed from the mount of the Lord, three dayes iourney: and the Arke of the couenant of the Lord went before them in the three dayes iourney, to searche out a resting place for them. 
\v 34 And the cloude of the Lord was vpon the by day, when they went out of the campe. 
\v 35 And when the Arke went forwarde, Moses saide, Rise vp, Lord, and let thine enemies bee scattered, and let them that hate thee, flee before thee. 
\v 36 And when it rested, hee sayde, Returne, O Lord, to the many thousands of Israel. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 When the people became murmurers, it displeased the Lord: and the Lord heard it, therefore his wrath was kindled, and the fire of the Lord burnt among them, and consumed the vtmost parte of the hoste. 
\v 2 Then the people cryed vnto Moses: and when Moses praied vnto the Lord, the fire was quenched. 
\v 3 And he called the name of that place Taberah, because the fire of the Lord burnt among them. 
\v 4 And a nomber of people that was amog them, fell a lusting, and turned away, and the children of Israel also wept, and saide, Who shall giue vs flesh to eate? 
\v 5 We remember the fish which we did eat in Egypt for nought, the cucumbers, and the pepons, and the leekes, and the onions, and the garleke. 
\v 6 But now our soule is dryed away, we can see nothing but this Man. 
\v 7 (The Man also was as coriander seede, and his colour like the colour of bdelium. 
\v 8 The people went about and gathered it, and ground it in milles, or beat it in morters, and baked it in a cauldron, and made cakes of it, and the taste of it was like vnto the taste of fresh oyle. 
\v 9 And when the dewe fell downe vpon the hoste in the night, the Man fell with it) 
\v 10 Then Moses heard the people weepe throughout their families, euery man in the doore of his tent, and the wrath of the Lord was grieuously kindled: also Moses was grieued. 
\v 11 And Moses saide vnto the Lord, Wherefore hast thou vexed thy seruant? and why haue I not found fauour in thy sight, seeing thou hast put the charge of al this people vpon mee? 
\v 12 Haue I conceiued al this people? or haue I begotte them, that thou shouldest say vnto me, Cary them in thy bosome (as a nurse beareth the sucking childe) vnto the lande, for the which thou swarest vnto their fathers? 
\v 13 Where should I haue flesh to giue vnto al this people? for they weepe vnto me, saying, Giue vs flesh that we may eate. 
\v 14 I am not able to beare al this people alone, for it is too heauie for me. 
\v 15 Therefore if thou deale thus with mee, I pray thee, if I haue founde fauour in thy sight, kill me, that I behold not my miserie. 
\v 16 Then the Lord said vnto Moses, Gather vnto me seuetie men of ye Elders of Israel, whome thou knowest, that they are the Elders of the people, and gouernonrs ouer them, and bring them vnto the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and let them stand there with thee, 
\v 17 And I will come downe, and talke with thee there, and take of the Spirite, which is vpon thee, and put vpon them, and they shall beare the burthen of the people with thee: so thou shalt not beare it alone. 
\v 18 Furthermore thou shalt saye vnto the people, Bee sanctified against to morowe, and yee shall eate flesh: for you haue wept in the eares of the Lord, saying, Who shall giue vs flesh to eate? for we were better in Egypt: therefore the Lord will giue you flesh, and ye shall eate. 
\v 19 Ye shall not eat one day nor two daies, nor fiue daies, neither ten daies, nor twentie dayes, 
\v 20 But a whole moneth, vntill it come out at your nostrels, and bee lothesome vnto you, because ye haue contemned the Lord, which is among you, and haue wept before him, saying, Why came we hither out of Egypt? 
\v 21 And Moses saide, Six hundreth thousande footemen are there of the people, among whom I am: and thou saiest, I will giue them flesh, that they may eate a moneth long. 
\v 22 Shall the sheepe and the beeues be slaine for them, to finde them? either shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them to suffice them? 
\v 23 And the Lord saide vnto Moses, Is the Lordes hand shortened? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to passe vnto thee, or no. 
\v 24 So Moses went out, and told the people the wordes of the Lord, and gathered seuentie men of the Elders of the people, and set them round about the Tabernacle. 
\v 25 Then the Lord came downe in a cloude, and spake vnto him, and tooke of the Spirit that was vpon him, and put it vpon the seuentie Ancient men: and when the Spirit rested vpon them, then they prophecied, and did not cease. 
\v 26 But there remained two of the men in the hoste: the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad, and the Spirit rested vpon them, (for they were of them that were written, and went not out vnto the Tabernacle) and they prophecied in the hoste. 
\v 27 Then there ranne a yong man, and tolde Moses, and saide, Eldad and Medad doe prophesie in the hoste. 
\v 28 And Ioshua the sonne of Nun the seruant of Moses one of his yong men answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them. 
\v 29 But Moses saide vnto him, Enuiest thou for my sake? yea, would God that all the Lordes people were Prophets, and that the Lord woulde put his Spirit vpon them. 
\v 30 And Moses returned into the hoste, he and the Elders of Israel. 
\v 31 Then there went foorth a winde from the Lord, and brought quailes from the Sea, and let them fall vpon the campe, a dayes iourney on this side, and a dayes iourney on the other side, round about the hoste, and they were about two cubites aboue the earth. 
\v 32 Then the people arose, al that day, and all the night, and all the next day, and gathered the quailes: he that gathered the least, gathered ten Homers full, and they spred them abroade for their vse round about the hoste. 
\v 33 While the flesh was yet betweene their teeth, before it was chewed, euen the wrath of the Lord was kindled against the people, and the Lord smote the people with an exceeding great plague. 
\v 34 So the name of the place was called, Kibroth-hattaauah: for there they buried the people that fell a lusting. 
\v 35 From Kibroth-hattaauah ye people tooke their iourney to Hazeroth, and abode at Hazeroth. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 Afterward Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses, because of the woman of Ethiopia whome hee had maried (for hee had married a woman of Ethiopia) 
\v 2 And they saide, What? hath the Lord spoken but onely by Moses? hath he not spoken also by vs? and the Lord heard this. 
\v 3 (But Moses was a verie meeke man, aboue all the men that were vpon the earth) 
\v 4 And by and by the Lord sayd vnto Moses, and vnto Aaron, and vnto Miriam, come out yee three vnto the Tabernacle of the Congregation: and they three came forth. 
\v 5 Then the Lord came downe in the pillar of the cloude, and stoode in the doore of the Tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam, and they both came forth. 
\v 6 And hee saide, Heare nowe my wordes, If there be a Prophet of the Lord among you, I will be knowen to him by a vision, and will speake vnto him by dreame. 
\v 7 My seruant Moses is not so, who is faithfull in all mine house. 
\v 8 Vnto him will I speake mouth to mouth, and by vision, and not in darke wordes, but hee shall see the similitude of the Lord. Wherefore then were ye not afraid to speake against my seruant, euen against Moses? 
\v 9 Thus the Lord was very angrie with them, and departed. 
\v 10 Also the cloude departed from the Tabernacle: and beholde, Miriam was leprous like snowe: and Aaron looked vpon Miriam, and beholde, she was leprous. 
\v 11 Then Aaron saide vnto Moses, Alas, my Lord, I beseech thee, lay not the sinne vpon vs, which we haue foolishly committed and wherein we haue sinned. 
\v 12 Let her not, I pray thee, be as one dead, of whome the flesh is halfe consumed, when he commeth out of his mothers wombe. 
\v 13 Then Moses cryed vnto the Lord, saying, O God, I beseech thee, heale her nowe. 
\v 14 And the Lord said vnto Moses, If her father had spit in her face, shoulde she not haue bene ashamed seuen dayes? let her be shut out of the hoste seuen dayes, and after she shall bee receiued. 
\v 15 So Miriam was shut out of the hoste seuen dayes, and the people remooued not, till Miriam was brought in againe. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 Then afterwarde the people remooued from Hazeroth, and pitched in the wildernesse of Paran. 
\v 2 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 3 Sende thou men out to search the lande of Canaan which I giue vnto the children of Israel: of euery tribe of their fathers shall ye sende a man, such as are all rulers among them. 
\v 4 Then Moses sent them out of the wildernesse of Paran at the commandement of the Lord: all those men were heades of the children of Israel. 
\v 5 Also their names are these: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the sonne of Zaccur: 
\v 6 Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the sonne of Hori: 
\v 7 Of the tribe of Iudah, Caleb the sonne of Iephunneh: 
\v 8 Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the sonne of Ioseph: 
\v 9 Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the sone of Nun: 
\v 10 Of the tribe of Beniamin, Palti the sonne of Raphu: 
\v 11 Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the sone of Sodi: 
\v 12 Of the tribe of Ioseph, to wit, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the sonne of Susi: 
\v 13 Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the sonne of Gemalli: 
\v 14 Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the sonne of Michael: 
\v 15 Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the sonne of Vophsi: 
\v 16 Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the sonne of Machi. 
\v 17 These are the names of the men, which Moses sent to spie out the lande: and Moses called ye name of Oshea the sonne of Nun, Iehoshua. 
\v 18 So Moses sent them to spie out the lande of Canaan, and said vnto them, Go vp this way toward the South, and go vp into the moutaines, 
\v 19 And consider the land what it is, and the people that dwel therein, whether they be strong or weake, either fewe or many, 
\v 20 Also what the lande is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad: and what cities they be, that they dwell in, whether they dwell in tents, or in walled townes: 
\v 21 And what the land is: whether it be fat or leane, whether there be trees therein, or not. And be of good courage, and bring of the fruite of the lande (for then was the time of the first ripe grapes) 
\v 22 So they went vp, and searched out the lande, from the wildernesse of Zin vnto Rehob, to go to Hamath, 
\v 23 And they ascended toward the South, and came vnto Hebron, where were Ahiman, Sheshai and Talmai, the sonnes of Anak. And Hebron was built seuen yeere before Zoan in Egypt. 
\v 24 Then they came to the riuer of Eshcol, and cut downe thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it vpon a barre betweene two, and brought of the pomegranates and of the figges. 
\v 25 That place was called the riuer Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes, which the children of Israel cut downe thence. 
\v 26 Then after fourtie dayes, they turned againe from searching of the land. 
\v 27 And they went and came to Moses and to Aaron and vnto al the Congregation of the children of Israel, in the wildernesse of Paran, to Kadesh, and brought to the, and to all the Congregation tydings, and shewed them the fruite of the lande. 
\v 28 And they tolde him, and saide, We came vnto the land whither thou hast sent vs, and surely it floweth with milke and honie: and here is of the fruite of it. 
\v 29 Neuerthelesse the people be strong that dwell in the land, and the cities are walled and exceeding great: and moreouer, we sawe the sonnes of Anak there. 
\v 30 The Amalekites dwell in the South countrey, and the Hittites, and the Iebusites, and the Amorites dwell in the mountaines, and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Iorden. 
\v 31 Then Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and saide, Let vs go vp at once, and possesse it: for vndoubtedly we shall ouercome it. 
\v 32 But the men, that went vp with him, saide, we be not able to goe vp against the people: for they are stronger then we. 
\v 33 So they brought vp an euill report of the land which they had searched for the children of Israel, saying, The lande which we haue gone through to search it out, is a land that eateth vp the inhabitants thereof: for all the people that we sawe in it, are men of great stature. 
\v 34 For there we sawe gyants, the sonnes of Anak, which come of the gyants, so that we seemed in our sight like grashoppers: and so wee were in their sight. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1 Then all ye Congregation lifted vp their voice, and cryed: and the people wept that night, 
\v 2 And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron: and the whole assemblie said vnto them, Would God we had died in the land of Egypt, or in this wildernesse: would God we were dead. 
\v 3 Wherefore nowe hath the Lord brought vs into this lande to fall vpon the sworde? our wiues, and our children shall be a pray: were it not better for vs to returne into Egypt? 
\v 4 And they said one to another, Let vs make a Captaine and returne into Egypt. 
\v 5 Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assemblie of the Congregation of the children of Israel. 
\v 6 And Ioshua the sonne of Nun, and Caleb the sonne of Iephunneh two of them that searched the lande, rent their clothes, 
\v 7 And spake vnto all the assemblie of the childre of Israel, saying, The land which we walked through to search it, is a very good lande. 
\v 8 If the Lord loue vs, he will bring vs into this land, and giue it vs, which is a land that floweth with milke and honie. 
\v 9 But rebell not ye against the Lord, neither feare ye the people of the land: for they are but bread for vs: their shielde is departed from the, and the Lord is with vs, feare them not. 
\v 10 And all the multitude saide, Stone them with stones: but the glory of the Lord appeared in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, before all the children of Israel. 
\v 11 And the Lord said vnto Moses, How long will this people prouoke me, and howe long will it be, yer they beleeue me, for al the signes which I haue shewed among them? 
\v 12 I will smite them with the pestilence and destroy them, and will make thee a greater nation and mightier then they. 
\v 13 But Moses saide vnto the Lord, When the Egyptians shall heare it, (for thou broughtest this people by thy power from among them) 
\v 14 Then they shall say to the inhabitants of this land, (for they haue heard that thou, Lord, art among this people, and that thou, Lord, art seene face to face, and that thy cloude standeth ouer them, and that thou goest before them by day time in a pillar of a cloude, and in a pillar of fire by night) 
\v 15 That thou wilt kill this people as one man: so the heathen which haue heard the fame of thee, shall thus say, 
\v 16 Because the Lord was not able to bring this people into the lande, which he sware vnto them, therefore hath he slaine them in the wildernesse. 
\v 17 And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying, 
\v 18 The Lord is slowe to anger, and of great mercie, and forgiuing iniquitie, and sinne, but not making the wicked innocent, and visiting the wickednes of the fathers vpon the children, in the thirde and fourth generation: 
\v 19 Be mercifull, I beseech thee, vnto the iniquitie of this people, according to thy great mercie, and as thou hast forgiuen this people from Egypt, euen vntill nowe. 
\v 20 And the Lord said, I haue forgiuen it, according to thy request. 
\v 21 Notwithstanding, as I liue, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord. 
\v 22 For all those men which haue seene my glory, and my miracles which I did in Egypt, and in the wildernes, and haue tempted me this ten times, and haue not obeyed my voyce, 
\v 23 Certainely they shall not see the lande, whereof I sware vnto their fathers: neither shall any that prouoke me, see it. 
\v 24 But my seruant Caleb, because he had another spirite, and hath followed me stil, euen him will I bring into the lande, whither he went, and his seede shall inherite it. 
\v 25 Nowe the Amalekites and the Canaanites remaine in the valley: wherefore turne backe to morowe, and get you into the wildernesse, by the way of the red Sea. 
\v 26 After, the Lord spake vnto Moses and to Aaron, saying, 
\v 27 How long shall I suffer this wicked multitude to murmure against me? I haue heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmure against me. 
\v 28 Tell them, As I liue (saith the Lord) I wil surely do vnto you, euen as ye haue spoken in mine eares. 
\v 29 Your carkeises shall fall in this wildernes, and all you that were counted through all your nombers, from twentie yeere olde and aboue, which haue murmured against me, 
\v 30 Ye shall not doubtles come into the land, for the which I lifted vp mine hande, to make you dwell therein, saue Caleb the sonne of Iephunneh, and Ioshua the sonne of Nun. 
\v 31 But your children, (which ye said shoulde be a pray) them will I bring in, and they shall knowe the lande which ye haue refused: 
\v 32 But euen your carkeises shall fall in this wildernes, 
\v 33 And your children shall wander in the wildernesse, fourtie yeeres, and shall beare your whoredomes, vntill your carkeises be wasted in the wildernesse. 
\v 34 After the number of the dayes, in the which ye searched out the lande, euen fourtie dayes, euery day for a yeere, shall ye beare your iniquity, for fourtie yeeres, and ye shall feele my breach of promise. 
\v 35 I the Lord haue said, Certainely I will doe so to all this wicked company, that are gathered together against me: for in this wildernesse they shall be consumed, and there they shall die. 
\v 36 And the men which Moses had sent to search the land (which, when they came againe, made all the people to murmure against him, and brought vp a slander vpon the lande) 
\v 37 Euen those men that did bring vp that vile slander vpon the land, shall die by a plague before the Lord. 
\v 38 But Ioshua the sonne of Nun, and Caleb the sonne of Iephunneh, of those men that went to search the land, shall liue. 
\v 39 Then Moses tolde these sayings vnto all the children of Israel, and the people sorowed greatly. 
\v 40 And they rose vp earely in the morning, and gate them vp into the toppe of the mountaine, saying, Loe, we be readie, to goe vp to the place which the Lord hath promised: for wee haue sinned. 
\v 41 But Moses said, Wherefore transgresse yee thus the commandement of the Lord? it will not so come well to passe. 
\v 42 Goe not vp (for the Lord is not among you) lest ye be ouerthrowe before your enemies. 
\v 43 For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and ye shall fall by the sworde: for in as much as ye are turned away from the Lord, the Lord also will not be with you. 
\v 44 Yet they presumed obstinately to goe vp to the top of the mountaine: but the Arke of the couenant of the Lord, and Moses departed not out of the campe. 
\v 45 Then the Amalekites and the Canaanites, which dwelt in that mountaine, came downe and smote them, and consumed them vnto Hormah. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say vnto them, Whe ye be come into the land of your habitations, which I giue vnto you, 
\v 3 And will make an offring by fire vnto the Lord, a burnt offring or a sacrifice to fulfil a vowe, or a free offring, or in your feastes, to make a sweete sauour vnto the Lord of the hearde, or of the flocke. 
\v 4 Then let him that offreth his offring vnto the Lord, bring a meate offring of a tenth deale of fine flowre, mingled with the fourth part of an Hin of oyle. 
\v 5 Also thou shalt prepare ye fourth part of an Hin of wine to be powred on a lambe, appointed for the burnt offring or any offring. 
\v 6 And for a ram, thou shalt for a meat offring, prepare two tenth deales of fine floure, mingled with the third part of an Hin of oyle. 
\v 7 And for a drinke-offering, thou shalt offer the third part of an Hin of wine, for a sweete sauour vnto the Lord. 
\v 8 And when thou preparest a bullocke for a burnt offring, or for a sacrifice to fulfill a vowe or a peace offring to the Lord, 
\v 9 Then let him offer with ye bullocke a meate offring of three tenth deales of fine floure, mingled with halfe an Hin of oyle. 
\v 10 And thou shalt bring for a drinke offring halfe an Hin of wine, for an offring made by fire of a sweete sauour vnto the Lord. 
\v 11 Thus shall it be done for a bullocke, or for a ram, or for a lambe, or for a kid. 
\v 12 According to the nomber that yee prepare to offer, so shall yee doe to euery one according to their nomber. 
\v 13 All that are borne of the countrey, shall do these things thus, to offer an offring made by fire of sweete sauour vnto the Lord. 
\v 14 And if a stranger soiourne with you, or whosoeuer bee among you in your generations, and will make an offring by fire of a sweete sauour vnto the Lord, as ye do, so hee shall doe. 
\v 15 One ordinance shalbe both for you of the Congregation, and also for the stranger that dwelleth with you, euen an ordinance for euer in your generations: as you are, so shall the stranger bee before the Lord. 
\v 16 One Lawe and one maner shall serue both for you and for the stranger that soiourneth with you. 
\v 17 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 18 Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say vnto them, When ye be come into the lande, to the which I bring you, 
\v 19 And when ye shall eate of the bread of the land, ye shall offer an heaue offring vnto ye Lord. 
\v 20 Ye shall offer vp a cake of the first of your dowe for an heaue offring: as the heaue offring of the barne, so ye shall lift it vp. 
\v 21 Of the first of your dowe ye shall giue vnto the Lord an heaue offring in your generations. 
\v 22 And if ye haue erred, and not obserued all these commandements, which the Lord hath spoken vnto Moses, 
\v 23 Euen all that the Lord hath commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the first day that the Lord commanded Moses, and hence forward among your generations: 
\v 24 And if so be that ought be committed ignorantly of the Congregation, then all ye Congregatio shall giue a bullocke for a burnt offring, for a sweete sauour vnto the Lord, with the meat offring and drinke offring thereto, according to the maner, and an hee goate for a sinne offring. 
\v 25 And the Priest shall make an atonement for al the Congregation of the children of Israel, and it shalbe forgiuen them: for it is ignorance: and they shall bring their offring for an offring made by fire vnto the Lord, and their sinne offering before the Lord for their ignorance. 
\v 26 Then it shalbe forgiuen all the Congregation of the children of Israel, and the stranger that dwelleth among them: for all the people were in ignorance. 
\v 27 But if any one person sinne through ignorance, then he shall bring a shee goate of a yeere olde for a sinne offring. 
\v 28 And the Priest shall make an atonement for the ignorant person, when hee sinneth by ignorance before the Lord, to make reconciliation for him: and it shalbe forgiuen him. 
\v 29 He that is borne among the children of Israel, and the stranger that dwelleth among them, shall haue both one lawe, who so doth sinne by ignorance. 
\v 30 But the person that doeth ought presumptuously, whether he be borne in the land, or a stranger, the same blasphemeth the Lord: therefore that person shalbe cut off from among his people, 
\v 31 Because he hath despised the worde of the Lord, and hath broken his commandement: that person shalbe vtterly cut off: his iniquitie shalbe vpon him. 
\v 32 And while the children of Israel were in the wildernesse, they found a man that gathered stickes vpon the Sabbath day. 
\v 33 And they that found him gathering sticks, brought him vnto Moses and to Aaron, and vnto all the Congregation, 
\v 34 And they put him warde: for it was not declared what should be done vnto him. 
\v 35 Then the Lord said vnto Moses, This man shall dye the death: and let al the multitude stone him with stones without the hoste. 
\v 36 And all the Congregation brought him without the hoste, and stoned him with stones, and he died, as the Lord had commanded Moses. 
\v 37 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 38 Speake vnto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes vpon the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and put vpon the fringes of the borders a ryband of blewe silke. 
\v 39 And ye shall haue the fringes, that when ye looke vpon them, ye may remember all the commandemets of the Lord, and do them: and that ye seeke not after your own heart, nor after your owne eyes, after the which ye go a whoring; 
\v 40 That yee may remember and doe all my commandements, and bee holy vnto your God. 
\v 41 I am the Lord your God, which brought you out of the lande of Egypt, to bee your God: I am the Lord your God.

\v 1 Nowe Korah the sonne of Izhar, the sonne of Kohath, the sonne of Leui went apart with Dathan, and Abiram the sonnes of Eliab, and On the sonne of Peleth, the sonnes of Reuben: 
\v 2 And they rose vp against Moses, with certaine of the children of Israel, two hundreth and fiftie captaines of the assemblie, famous in the Congregation, and men of renoume, 
\v 3 Who gathered themselues together against Moses, and against Aaron, and sayde vnto them, Ye take too much vpon you, seeing all the Congregation is holie, euery one of them, and the Lord is among them: wherfore then lift ye your selues aboue the Congregation of the Lord? 
\v 4 But when Moses heard it, hee fell vpon his face, 
\v 5 And spake to Korah and vnto all his companie, saying, To morow the Lord will shew who is his, and who is holy, and who ought to approche neere vnto him: and whom he hath chosen, hee will cause to come neere to him. 
\v 6 This doe therefore, Take you censers, both Korah, and all his companie, 
\v 7 And put fire therein, and put incense in the before the Lord to morowe: and the man whome the Lord doeth chuse, the same shalbe holie: ye take too much vpon you, ye sonnes of Leui. 
\v 8 Againe Moses saide vnto Korah, Heare, I pray you, ye sonnes of Leui. 
\v 9 Seemeth it a small thing vnto you that the God of Israel hath separated you from the multitude of Israel, to take you neere to himselfe, to doe the seruice of the Tabernacle of the Lord, and to stand before the Congregation and to minister vnto them? 
\v 10 He hath also taken thee to him, and all thy brethren the sonnes of Leui with thee, and seeke ye the office of the Priest also? 
\v 11 For which cause, thou, and all thy companie are gathered together against the Lord: and what is Aaron, that ye murmure against him? 
\v 12 And Moses sent to call Dathan, and Abiram the sonnes of Eliab: who answered, We will not come vp. 
\v 13 Is it a small thing that thou hast brought vs out of a lande that floweth with milke and honie, to kill vs in the wildernesse, except thou make thy selfe lord and ruler ouer vs also? 
\v 14 Also thou hast not brought vs vnto a land that floweth with milke and honie, neither giuen vs inheritance of fieldes and vineyardes: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come vp. 
\v 15 Then Moses waxed verie angry, and saide vnto the Lord, Looke not vnto their offring: I haue not taken so much as an asse from them, neither haue I hurt any of them. 
\v 16 And Moses said vnto Korah, Bee thou and al thy companie before the Lord: both thou, they, and Aaron to morowe: 
\v 17 And take euery man his censor, and put incense in them, and bring ye euery man his censor before the Lord, two hundreth and fiftie censors: thou also and Aaron, euery one his censor. 
\v 18 So they tooke euery man his censor, and put fire in them, and laide incense thereon, and stoode in the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation with Moses and Aaron. 
\v 19 And Korah gathered all the multitude against them vnto the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation: then the glorie of the Lord appeared vnto all the Congregation. 
\v 20 And the Lord spake vnto Moses and to Aaron, saying, 
\v 21 Separate your selues from among this Cogregation, that I may consume them at once. 
\v 22 And they fell vpon their faces and saide, O God the God of the spirits, of all fleshe, hath not one man onely sinned, and wilt thou bee wroth with all the Congregation? 
\v 23 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 24 Speake vnto the Congregation and say, Get you away from about the Tabernacle of Korah, Dathan and Abiram. 
\v 25 Then Moses rose vp, and went vnto Dathan and Abiram, and the Elders of Israel followed him. 
\v 26 And he spake vnto the Congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tentes of these wicked men, and touche nothing of theirs, lest ye perish in all their sinnes. 
\v 27 So they gate them away from the Tabernacle of Korah, Dathan and Abiram on euerie side: and Dathan, and Abiram came out and stood in the doore of their tentes with their wiues, and their sonnes, and their little children. 
\v 28 And Moses saide, Hereby yee shall knowe that the Lord hath sent me to do all these works: for I haue not done them of mine owne minde. 
\v 29 If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men, the Lord hath not sent me. 
\v 30 But if the Lord make a newe thing, and the earth open her mouth, and swallowe them vp with all that they haue, and they goe downe quicke into ye pit, then ye shall vnderstand that these men haue prouoked the Lord. 
\v 31 And assoone as he had made an ende of speaking all these wordes, euen the ground claue asunder that was vnder them, 
\v 32 And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them vp, with their families, and all the men that were with Korah, and all their goods. 
\v 33 So they and all that they had, went down aliue into the pit, and the earth couered them: so they perished from among the Congregation. 
\v 34 And all Israel that were about them, fled at the crie of them: for they said, Let vs flee, least the earth swalow vs vp. 
\v 35 But there came out a fire from the Lord, and consumed the two hundreth and fiftie men that offred the incense. 
\v 36 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 37 Speake vnto Eleazar, the sonne of Aaron the Priest, that he take vp the censers out of the burning, and scatter the fire beyond the altar: for they are halowed, 
\v 38 The censers, I say, of these sinners, that destroyed themselues: and let them make of them broade plates for a couering of the Altar: for they offered them before the Lord, therefore they shalbe holy, and they shall be a signe vnto the children of Israel. 
\v 39 Then Eleazar the Priest tooke the brasen censers, which they, that were burnt, had offred, and made broade plates of them for a couering of the Altar. 
\v 40 It is a remembrance vnto the children of Israel, that no stranger which is not of the seede of Aaron, come neere to offer incense before the Lord, that he be not like Korah and his company, as the Lord said to him by the hand of Moses. 
\v 41 But on the morowe all the multitude of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye haue killed the people of the Lord. 
\v 42 And when the Congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron, then they turned their faces toward the Tabernacle of the Congregation: and beholde, the cloude couered it, and the glory of the Lord appeared. 
\v 43 Then Moses and Aaron were come before the Tabernacle of the Congregation. 
\v 44 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 45 Get you vp from among this Congregation: for I wil consume them quickly: then they fell vpon their faces. 
\v 46 And Moses said vnto Aaron, Take the censer and put fire therein of the Altar, and put therein incense, and goe quickly vnto the Congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the Lord: the plague is begunne. 
\v 47 Then Aaron tooke as Moses commanded him, and ranne into the middes of the Congregation, and beholde, the plague was begun among the people, and hee put in incense, and made an atonement for the people. 
\v 48 And when hee stoode betweene the dead, and them that were aliue, the plague was stayed. 
\v 49 So they died of this plague fourtene thousande and seuen hundreth, beside them that dyed in the conspiracie of Korah. 
\v 50 And Aaron went againe vnto Moses before the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and the plague was stayed. 
\c 17  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Speake vnto the children of Israel, and take of euery one of them a rod, after the house of their fathers, of all their princes according to the familie of their fathers, euen twelue rods: and thou shalt write euery mans name vpon his rod. 
\v 3 And write Aarons name vpon the rod of Leui: for euery rodde shalbe for the head of the house of their fathers. 
\v 4 And thou shalt put them in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, before the Arke of the Testimonie, where I wil declare my selfe to you. 
\v 5 And the mans rod, whome I chuse, shall blossome: and I will make cease from mee the grudgings of the children of Israel, which grudge against you. 
\v 6 Then Moses spake vnto the children of Israel, and al their princes gaue him a rod, one rod for euery Prince, according to the houses of their fathers, euen twelue rods, and the rod of Aaron was among their roddes. 
\v 7 And Moses layde the rods before the Lord in the Tabernacle of the Testimonie. 
\v 8 And when Moses on the morow went into the Tabernacle of the Testimonie, beholde, the rod of Aaron for the house of Leui was budded, and brought forth buddes, and brought forth blossoms, and bare ripe almondes. 
\v 9 Then Moses brought out all the rods from before the Lord vnto all the children of Israel: and they looked vpon them, and tooke euery man his rodde. 
\v 10 After, the Lord said vnto Moses, Bring Aarons rod againe before the Testimonie to bee kept for a token to the rebellious children, and thou shalt cause their murmurings to cease from me, that they dye not. 
\v 11 So Moses did as the Lord had commanded him: so did he. 
\v 12 And the children of Israel spake vnto Moses, saying, Behold, we are dead, we perish, we are all lost: 
\v 13 Whosoeuer commeth neere, or approcheth to the Tabernacle of the Lord, shall dye: shall we be consumed and dye? 
\c 18  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord sayd vnto Aaron, Thou, and thy sonnes and thy fathers house with thee, shall beare the iniquitie of the Sanctuarie: both thou and thy sonnes with thee shall beare the iniquitie of your Priestes office. 
\v 2 And bring also with thee thy brethren of the tribe of Leui of ye familie of thy father, which shalbe ioyned with thee, and minister vnto thee: but thou, and thy sonnes with thee shall minister before the Tabernacle of the Testimonie: 
\v 3 And they shall keepe thy charge, euen the charge of all the Tabernacle: but they shall not come neere the instruments of the Sanctuary, nor to the altar, lest they die, both they and you: 
\v 4 And they shalbe ioyned with thee, and keepe the charge of the Tabernacle of the Congregation for all the seruice of the Tabernacle: and no stranger shall come neere vnto you: 
\v 5 Therefore shall ye keepe the charge of the Sanctuarie, and the charge of the altar: so there shall fall no more wrath vpon the children of Israel. 
\v 6 For lo, I haue taken your brethren the Leuites from among the children of Israel, which as a gift of yours, are giuen vnto the Lord, to do the seruice of the Tabernacle of the Congregation. 
\v 7 But thou, and thy sonnes with thee shall keepe your Priestes office for all things of the altar, and within the vaile: therefore shall ye serue: for I haue made your Priestes office an office of seruice: therefore the stranger that cometh neere, shalbe slayne. 
\v 8 Againe the Lord spake vnto Aaron, Behold, I haue giuen thee the keeping of mine offrings, of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel: vnto thee I haue giuen them for the anoyntings sake, and to thy sonnes, for a perpetuall ordinance. 
\v 9 This shalbe thine of the most holy things, reserued from the fire: all their offering of all their meate offring, and of all their sinne offring, and of all their trespasse offring, which they bring vnto me, that shalbe most holy vnto thee, and to thy sonnes. 
\v 10 In the most holy place shalt thou eate it: euery male shall eate of it: it is holy vnto thee. 
\v 11 This also shalbe thine: the heaue offering of their gift, with all the shake offerings of the children of Israel: I haue giuen them vnto thee and to thy sonnes and to thy daughters with thee, to be a duetie for euer al the cleane in thine house shall eate of it. 
\v 12 All the fat of the oyle, and all the fat of the wine, and of the wheate, which they shall offer vnto the Lord for their first fruites, I haue giuen them vnto thee. 
\v 13 And the first ripe of al that is in their land, which they shall bring vnto Lord, shalbe thine: all the cleane in thine house shall eate of it. 
\v 14 Euery thing separate from the common vse in Israel, shalbe thine. 
\v 15 All that first openeth the matrice of any flesh, which they shall offer vnto the Lord, of man or beast, shalbe thine: but the first borne of man shalt thou redeeme, and the first borne of the vncleane beast shalt thou redeeme. 
\v 16 And those that are to bee redeemed, shalt thou redeeme from the age of a moneth, according to thy estimation, for the money of fiue shekels, after the shekel of the Sanctuarie, which is twentie gerahs. 
\v 17 But the first borne of a kow, or the first borne of a sheepe, or the first borne of a goate shalt thou not redeeme: for they are holy: thou shalt sprinkle their blood at the altar, and thou shalt burne their fat: it is a sacrifice made by fire for a sweete sauour vnto the Lord. 
\v 18 And the flesh of them shalbe thine, as the shake breast, and as the right shoulder shalbe thine. 
\v 19 All the heaue offrings of the holy things which the children of Israel shall offer vnto the Lord, haue I giuen thee, and thy sonnes, and thy daughters with thee, to be a duetie for euer: it is a perpetual couenant of salt before the Lord, to thee, and to thy seede with thee. 
\v 20 And the Lord sayde vnto Aaron, Thou shalt haue none inheritance in their lande, neyther shalt thou haue any parte among them: I am thy part and thine inheritance among the children of Israel. 
\v 21 For beholde, I haue giuen the children of Leui all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their seruice which they serue in the Tabernacle of the Congregation. 
\v 22 Neyther shall the children of Israel any more come neere the Tabernacle of the Congregation, lest they susteine sinne, and die. 
\v 23 But the Leuites shall do the seruice in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and they shall beare their sinne: it is a law for euer in your generations, that among the children of Israel they possesse none inheritance. 
\v 24 For the tythes of the children of Israel, which they shall offer as an offring vnto the Lord, I haue giuen the Leuites for an inheritance: therfore I haue said vnto them, Among the children of Israel ye shall possesse none inheritance. 
\v 25 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 26 Speake also vnto the Leuites and say vnto them, When ye shall take of the children of Israel the tithes, which I haue giuen you of them for your inheritance, then shall ye take an heaue offring of that same for the Lord, euen the tenth part of the tithe. 
\v 27 And your heaue offering shalbe reckened vnto you, as the corne of the barne, or as the abundance of the wine presse. 
\v 28 So ye shall also offer an heaue offring vnto the Lord of all your tithes, which ye shall receiue of the children of Israel, and ye shall giue thereof the Lords heaue offring to Aaron the Priest. 
\v 29 Ye shall offer of all your gifts al the Lords heaue offrings: of all the fat of the same shall ye offer the holy things thereof. 
\v 30 Therefore thou shalt say vnto them, When ye haue offred the fat thereof, then it shalbe couted vnto the Leuites, as the encrease of the corne floore, or as the encrease of the wine presse. 
\v 31 And ye shall eate it in al places, ye, and your housholdes: for it is your wages for your seruice in the Tabernacle of the Congregation. 
\v 32 And ye shall beare no sinne by the reason of it, when ye haue offred the fatte of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the children of Israel, lest ye die. 
\c 19  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spake to Moses, and to Aaron, saying, 
\v 2 This is the ordinance of the lawe, which the Lord hath commanded, saying, Speake vnto the children of Israel that they bring thee a red kow without blemish, wherein is no spot, vpon the which neuer came yoke. 
\v 3 And ye shall giue her vnto Eleazar ye Priest, that hee may bring her without the hoste, and cause her to be slaine before his face. 
\v 4 Then shall Eleazar the Priest take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle it before the Tabernacle of the Congregation seuen times, 
\v 5 And cause the kow to be burnt in his sight: with her skinne, and her flesh, and her blood, and her doung shall he burne her. 
\v 6 Then shall the Priest take cedar wood, and hyssope and skarlet lace, and cast them in the mids of the fire where the kow burneth. 
\v 7 Then shall the Priest wash his clothes, and he shall wash his flesh in water, and then come into the hoste, and the Priest shalbe vncleane vnto the euen. 
\v 8 Also he that burneth her, shall wash his clothes in water, and wash his flesh in water, and be vncleane vntill euen. 
\v 9 And a man, that is cleane, shall take vp the ashes of the kow, and put them without the hoste in a cleane place: and it shalbe kept for the Congregation of the children of Israel for a sprinkling water: it is a sinne offring. 
\v 10 Therefore he that gathereth the ashes of the kow, shall wash his clothes, and remaine vncleane vntil euen: and it shalbe vnto the children of Israel, and vnto the stranger that dwelleth among them, a statute for euer. 
\v 11 Hee that toucheth the dead body of any man, shalbe vncleane euen seuen dayes. 
\v 12 Hee shall purifie himselfe therewith the third day, and the seuenth day he shall be cleane: but if he purifie not himselfe the thirde day, then the seuenth day he shall not be cleane. 
\v 13 Whosoeuer toucheth ye corps of any man that is dead, and purgeth not himselfe, defileth the Tabernacle of the Lord, and that person shall be cut off from Israel, because the sprinkling water was not sprinkled vpon him: he shall be vncleane, and his vncleannesse shall remaine still vpon him. 
\v 14 This is the law, Whe a man dieth in a tent, all that come into the tent, and all that is in the tent, shalbe vncleane seuen dayes, 
\v 15 And all the vessels that bee open, which haue no couering fastened vpon them, shall be vncleane. 
\v 16 Also whosoeuer toucheth one that is slaine with a sworde in the fielde, or a dead person, or a bone of a dead man, or a graue, shall be vncleane seuen dayes. 
\v 17 Therfore for an vncleane person they shall take of the burnt ashes of the sinne offring, and pure water shalbe put thereto in a vessel. 
\v 18 And a cleane person shall take hyssope and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it vpon the tent, and vpon all the vessels, and on the persons that were therein, and vpon him that touched ye bone, or the slayne, or the dead, or the graue. 
\v 19 And the cleane person shall sprinkle vpon the vncleane the third day, and the seuenth day, and hee shall purifie him selfe the seuenth day, and wash his clothes, and wash himself in water, and shalbe cleane at euen. 
\v 20 But the man that is vncleane and purifieth not himselfe, that person shalbe cut off from among the Congregation, because hee hath defiled the Sanctuarie of the Lord: and the sprinkling water hath not bene sprinkled vpon him: therefore shall he be vncleane. 
\v 21 And it shalbe a perpetual lawe vnto them, that he that sprinkleth the sprinkling water, shall wash his clothes: also hee that toucheth the sprinkling water, shalbe vncleane vntill euen. 
\v 22 And whatsoeuer the vncleane person toucheth, shall be vncleane: and the person that toucheth him, shalbe vncleane vntill the euen. 
\c 20  
\p
\v 1 Then the children of Israel came with ye whole Congregation to the desert of Zin in the first moneth, and the people abode at Cadesh: where Miriam died, and was buried there. 
\v 2 But there was no water for the Congregation, and they assembled them selues against Moses and against Aaron. 
\v 3 And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God we had perished, when our brethren died before the Lord. 
\v 4 Why haue ye thus brought the Congregation of the Lord vnto his wildernesse, that both we, and our cattell should die there? 
\v 5 Wherefore nowe haue yee made vs to come vp from Egypt, to bring vs into this miserable place, which is no place of seede, nor figges, nor vines, nor pomegranates? neither is there any water to drinke. 
\v 6 Then Moses and Aaron went from the assemblie vnto the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and fell vpon their faces: and the glory of the Lord appeared vnto them. 
\v 7 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 8 Take the rod, and gather thou and thy brother Aaron the Congregation together, and speake yee vnto the rocke before their eyes, and it shall giue foorth his water, and thou shalt bring them water out of the rocke: so thou shalt giue the Congregation, and their beastes drinke. 
\v 9 Then Moses tooke the rod from before the Lord, as he had commanded him. 
\v 10 And Moses and Aaron gathered the Congregation together before the rocke, and Moses sayd vnto them, Heare nowe, ye rebels: shall we bring you water out of this rocke? 
\v 11 Then Moses lift vp his hande, and with his rod he smote the rocke twise, and the water came out aboundantly: so the Congregation, and their beastes dranke. 
\v 12 Againe the Lord spake vnto Moses, and to Aaron, Because ye beleeued me not, to sanctifie mee in the presence of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this Congregation into the land which I haue giuen them. 
\v 13 This is the water of Meribah, because the children of Israel stroue with the Lord, and hee was sanctified in them. 
\v 14 Then Moses sent messengers from Kadesh vnto the king of Edom, saying, Thus sayth thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the trauaile that we haue had, 
\v 15 How our fathers went downe into Egypt, and we dwelt in Egypt a long time, where the Egyptians handled vs euill and our fathers. 
\v 16 But when we cried vnto the Lord, he heard our voyce, and sent an Angel, and hath brought vs out of Egypt, and beholde, wee are in the citie Kadesh, in thine vtmost border. 
\v 17 I pray thee that we may passe through thy countrey: we will not goe through the fieldes nor the vineyardes, neither will we drinke of the water of the welles: we will goe by the kings way, and neither turne vnto the right hand nor to the left, vntill we be past thy borders. 
\v 18 And Edom answered him, Thou shalt not passe by mee, least I come out against thee with the sword. 
\v 19 Then the children of Israel said vnto him, We will goe vp by the hie way: and if I and my cattell drinke of thy water, I will then pay for it: I will onely (without any harme) goe through on my feete. 
\v 20 Hee answered againe, Thou shalt not goe through. The Edom came out against him with much people, and with a mightie power. 
\v 21 Thus Edom denyed to giue Israel passage through his countrey: wherefore Israel turned away from him. 
\v 22 And when the children of Israel with al the Congregation departed from Kadesh, they came vnto the mount Hor. 
\v 23 And the Lord spake vnto Moses and to Aaron in the mount Hor neere the coast of the land of Edom, saying, 
\v 24 Aaron shall be gathered vnto his people: for hee shall not enter into the lande, which I haue giuen vnto the children of Israel, because ye disobeyed my commandement at the water of Meribah. 
\v 25 Take Aaron and Eleazar his sonne, and bring them vp into the mount Hor, 
\v 26 And cause Aaron to put off his garmentes and put them vpon Eleazar his sonne: for Aaron shall be gathered to his fathers, and shall die there. 
\v 27 And Moses did as the Lord had commanded: and they went vp into the mount Hor, in the sight of all the Congregation. 
\v 28 And Moses put off Aarons clothes, and put them vpon Eleazar his sonne: so Aaron dyed there in the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came downe from off the mount. 
\v 29 When al the Congregation sawe that Aaron was dead, al the house of Israel wept for Aaron thirtie dayes. 
\c 21  
\p
\v 1 When King Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt toward the South, heard tel that Israel came by the way of the spies, then fought hee against Israel, and tooke of them prysoners. 
\v 2 So Israel vowed a vowe vnto the Lord, and said, If thou wilt deliuer and giue this people into mine hand, then I wil vtterly destroy their cities. 
\v 3 And the Lord heard the voyce of Israel, and deliuered them the Canaanites: and they vtterly destroied them and their cities, and called ye name of the place Hormah. 
\v 4 After, they departed from the mount Hor by the way of the red Sea, to compasse the land of Edom: and the people were sore grieued because of the way. 
\v 5 And the people spake against God and against Moses, saying, Wherefore haue ye brought vs out of Egypt, to die in the wildernesse? for here is neither bread nor water, and our soule lotheth this light bread. 
\v 6 Wherefore the Lord sent fierie serpents among ye people, which stung the people: so that many of the people of Israel died. 
\v 7 Therefore the people came to Moses and said, We haue sinned: for wee haue spoken against the Lord, and against thee: pray to the Lord, that he take away the serpents from vs: and Moses prayed for the people. 
\v 8 And the Lord said vnto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it vp for a signe, that as many as are bitten, may looke vpon it, and liue. 
\v 9 So Moses made a serpent of brasse, and set it vp for a signe: and when a serpent had bitten a man, then he looked to the serpent of brasse, and liued. 
\v 10 And ye children of Israel departed thence, and pitched in Oboth. 
\v 11 And they departed from Oboth, and pitched in lie-abarim, in the wildernesse, which is before Moab on the Eastside. 
\v 12 They remoued thence, and pitched vpon the riuer of Zared. 
\v 13 Thence they departed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which is in the wildernesse, and commeth out of the coasts of the Amorites: (for Arnon is the border of Moab, betweene the Moabites and the Amorites) 
\v 14 Wherefore it shall be spoken in the booke of the battels of the Lord, what thing he did in the red sea, and in the riuers of Arnon, 
\v 15 And at the streame of the riuers that goeth downe to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth vpon the border of Moab. 
\v 16 And from thence they turned to Beer: the same is the well where the Lord said vnto Moses, Assemble the people, and I wil giue them water. 
\v 17 Then Israel sang this song, Rise vp well, sing ye vnto it. 
\v 18 The princes digged this well, the captaines of the people digged it, euen the lawe giuer, with their staues. And from the wildernesse they came to Mattanah, 
\v 19 And from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth, 
\v 20 And from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the plaine of Moab, to the top of Pisgah that looketh toward Ieshimon. 
\v 21 Then Israel sent messengers vnto Sihon, King of the Amorites, saying, 
\v 22 Let me goe through thy land: we wil not turne aside into the fieldes, nor into the vineyardes, neither drinke of the waters of ye welles: we will goe by the kings way, vntill we be past thy countrey. 
\v 23 But Sihon gaue Israel no licence to passe through his countrey, but Sihon assembled all his people, and went out against Israel into the wildernesse: and he came to Iahoz, and fought against Israel. 
\v 24 But Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and conquered his land, from Arnon vnto Iabok, euen vnto ye children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong. 
\v 25 And Israel tooke al these cities, and dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites in Heshbon and in all the villages thereof. 
\v 26 For Heshbon was the citie of Sihon the king of the Amorites, which had fought beforetime against the king of the Moabites, and had taken al his land out of his hand, euen vnto Arnon. 
\v 27 Wherefore they that speake in prouerbes, say, Come to Heshbon, let the citie of Sihon bee built and repaired: 
\v 28 For a fire is gone out of Heshbon, and a flame from the citie of Sihon, and hath consumed Ar of the Moabites, and the lords of Bamoth in Arnon. 
\v 29 Wo be to thee, Moab: O people of Chemosh, thou art vndone: he hath suffered his sonnes to be pursued, and his daughters to be in captiuitie to Sihon the king of the Amorites. 
\v 30 Their empire also is lost from Heshbon vnto Dibon, and wee haue destroyed them vnto Nophah, which reacheth vnto Medeba. 
\v 31 Thus Israel dwelt in the lande of the Amorites. 
\v 32 And Moses sent to searche out Iaazer, and they tooke the townes belonging thereto, and rooted out the Amorites that were there. 
\v 33 And they turned and went vp toward Bashan: and Og the King of Bashan came out against them, hee, and all his people, to fight at Edrei. 
\v 34 Then the Lord said vnto Moses, Feare him not: for I haue deliuered him into thine hand and all his people, and his land: and thou shalt do to him as thou diddest vnto Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon. 
\v 35 They smote him therefore, and his sonnes, and all his people, vntill there was none left him: so they conquered his land. 
\c 22  
\p
\v 1 After, the children of Israel departed and pitched in the plaine of Moab on the other side of Iorden from Iericho. 
\v 2 Now Balak the sonne of Zippor sawe all that Israel had done to the Amorites. 
\v 3 And the Moabites were sore afraide of the people, because they were many, and Moab fretted against the children of Israel. 
\v 4 Therfore Moab said vnto the Elders of Midian, Nowe shall this multitude licke vp all that are round about vs, as an oxe licketh vp ye grasse of the fielde: and Balak the sonne of Zippor was King of the Moabites at that time. 
\v 5 Hee sent messengers therefore vnto Balaam the sonne of Beor to Pethor (which is by the riuer of the lande of the children of his folke) to call him, saying, Beholde, there is a people come out of Egypt, which couer the face of the earth, and lye ouer against me. 
\v 6 Come now therefore, I pray thee, and curse me this people (for they are stronger then I) so it may be that I shall be able to smite them, and to driue them out of the land: for I knowe that hee, whome thou blessest, is blessed, and he whom thou cursest, shall be cursed. 
\v 7 And the Elders of Moab, and the Elders of Midian departed, hauing the reward of the soothsaying in their hande, and they came vnto Balaam, and tolde him the wordes of Balak. 
\v 8 Who answered them, Tary here this night, and I will giue you an answere, as the Lord shall say vnto mee. So the princes of Moab abode with Balaam. 
\v 9 Then God came vnto Balaam, and sayde, What men are these with thee? 
\v 10 And Baalam said vnto God, Balak ye sonne of Zippor, king of Moab hath set vnto me, saying, 
\v 11 Beholde, there is a people come out of Egypt and couereth the face of the earth: come nowe, curse them for my sake: so it may be that I shalbe able to ouercome them in battell, and to driue them out. 
\v 12 And God said vnto Balaam, Go not thou with them, neither curse the people, for they are blessed. 
\v 13 And Balaam rose vp in the morning, and sayde vnto ye princes of Balak, Returne vnto your land: for the Lord hath refused to giue me leaue to go with you. 
\v 14 So the princes of Moab rose vp, and went vnto Balak, and sayd, Balaam hath refused to come with vs. 
\v 15 Balak yet sent againe moe princes, and more honourable then they. 
\v 16 Who came to Balaam, and sayde to him, Thus saith Balak the sonne of Zippor, Bee not thou staied, I pray thee, from comming vnto me. 
\v 17 For I wil promote thee vnto great honour, and wil do whatsoeuer thou sayest vnto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people. 
\v 18 And Balaam answered, and sayde vnto the seruants of Balak, If Balak woulde giue me his house full of siluer and golde, I can not goe beyonde the worde of the Lord my God, to doe lesse or more. 
\v 19 But nowe, I pray you, tary here this night, that I may wit, what the Lord will say vnto mee more. 
\v 20 And God came vnto Balaam by night, and sayd vnto him, If the men come to call thee, rise vp, and goe with them: but onely what thing I say vnto thee, that shalt thou doe. 
\v 21 So Balaam rose vp early, and sadled his asse, and went with the princes of Moab. 
\v 22 And ye wrath of God was kindled, because he went: and the Angel of the Lord stood in the way to be against him, as he rode vpon his asse, and his two seruants were with him. 
\v 23 And when the asse saw the Angel of the Lord stand in the way, and his sworde drawen in his hand, the asse turned out of the way and went into the field, but Balaam smote the asse, to turne her into the way. 
\v 24 Againe the Angel of the Lord stood in a path of the vineyardes, hauing a wall on the one side, and a wall on the other. 
\v 25 And when the asse sawe the Angel of the Lord, she thrust her selfe vnto the wall, and dasht Balaams foote against the wall: wherefore hee smote her againe. 
\v 26 Then the Angel of the Lord went further, and stoode in a narowe place, where was no way to turne, either to the right hand, or to the left. 
\v 27 And when the asse sawe the Angell of the Lord, she lay downe vnder Balaam: therefore Balaam was very wroth, and smote the asse with a staffe. 
\v 28 Then the Lord opened the mouth of the asse, and she saide vnto Balaam, What haue I done vnto thee, that thou hast smitten me nowe three times? 
\v 29 And Balaam saide vnto the asse, Because thou hast mocked me: I woulde there were a sworde in mine hand, for nowe would I kill thee. 
\v 30 And the asse saide vnto Balaam, Am not I thine asse, which thou hast ridden vpon since thy first time vnto this day? haue I vsed at any time to doe thus vnto thee? Who said, Nay. 
\v 31 And the Lord opened the eyes of Balaam, and he sawe the Angel of the Lord standing in the way with his sword drawen in his hande: then he bowed him selfe, and fell flat on his face. 
\v 32 And the Angel of the Lord said vnto him, Wherefore hast thou nowe smitten thine asse three times? beholde, I came out to withstande thee, because thy way is not straight before me. 
\v 33 But the asse sawe me, and turned from me now three times: for els, if she had not turned from me, surely I had euen nowe slaine thee, and saued her aliue. 
\v 34 Then Balaam saide vnto the Angel of the Lord, I haue sinned: for I wist not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore if it displease thee, I will turne home againe. 
\v 35 But the Angel said vnto Balaam, Go with the men: but what I say vnto thee, that shalt thou speake. So Balaam went with ye princes of Balak. 
\v 36 And when Balak heard that Balaam came, he went out to meete him vnto a citie of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, euen in the vtmost coast. 
\v 37 Then Balak saide vnto Balaam, Did I not sende for thee to call thee? Wherefore camest thou not vnto me? am I not able in deede to promote thee vnto honour? 
\v 38 And Balaam made answere vnto Balak, Lo, I am come vnto thee, and can I nowe say any thing at all? the worde that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speake. 
\v 39 So Balaam went with Balak, and they came vnto the citie of Huzoth. 
\v 40 Then Balak offred bullockes, and sheepe, and sent thereof to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him. 
\v 41 And on the morowe Balak tooke Balaam, and brought him vp into the hie places of Baal, that thence hee might see the vtmost part of the people. 
\c 23  
\p
\v 1 And Balaam sayd vnto Balak, Builde me here seuen altars, and prepare me here seuen bullockes, and seuen rammes. 
\v 2 And Balak did as Balaam sayd, and Balak and Balaam offred on euery altar a bullocke and a ramme. 
\v 3 Then Balaam sayde vnto Balak, Stande by the burnt offring, and I will goe, if so be that the Lord will come and meete me: and whatsoeuer he sheweth me, I will tell thee: so he went forth alone. 
\v 4 And God met Balaam, and Balaam sayd vnto him, I haue prepared seuen altars, and haue offred vpon euery altar a bullocke and a ramme. 
\v 5 And the Lord put an answere in Balaams mouth, and sayde, Go againe to Balak, and say on this wise. 
\v 6 So when he returned vnto him, loe, hee stoode by his burnt offering, he, and all the princes of Moab. 
\v 7 Then he vttered his parable, and sayde, Balak the king of Moab hath brought mee from Aram out of the mountaines of the East, saying, Come, curse Iaakob for my sake: come, and detest Israel. 
\v 8 How shall I curse, where God hath not cursed? or howe shall I detest, where the Lord hath not detested? 
\v 9 For from the top of the rocks I did see him, and from the hils I did beholde him: lo, the people shall dwell by themselues, and shall not be reckened among the nations. 
\v 10 Who can tell the dust of Iaakob, and the nomber of the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last ende be like his. 
\v 11 Then Balak saide vnto Balaam, What hast thou done vnto mee? I tooke thee to curse mine enemies, and beholde, thou hast blessed them altogether. 
\v 12 And he answered, and said, Must I not take heede to speake that, which the Lord hath put in my mouth? 
\v 13 And Balak sayde vnto him, Come, I pray thee, with mee vnto another place, whence thou mayest see them, and thou shalt see but the vtmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: therefore curse them out of that place for my sake. 
\v 14 And he brought him into Sede-sophim to the top of Pisgah, and built seuen altars, and offred a bullocke, and a ramme on euery altar. 
\v 15 After, he sayde vnto Balak, Stande here by thy burnt offring, and I wil meete the Lord yonder. 
\v 16 And the Lord mette Balaam, and put an answere in his mouth, and sayd, Goe againe vnto Balak, and say thus. 
\v 17 And when he came to him, beholde, hee stoode by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him: so Balak sayde vnto him, What hath the Lord sayd? 
\v 18 And he vttered his parable, and sayde, Rise vp, Balak, and heare: hearken vnto me, thou sonne of Zippor. 
\v 19 God is not as man, that he should lie, neither as the sonne of man that he shoulde repent: hath he sayde and shall he not do it? and hath he spoken, and shall he not accomplish it? 
\v 20 Behold, I haue receiued commandement to blesse: for he hath blessed, and I cannot alter it. 
\v 21 Hee seeth none iniquitie in Iaakob, nor seeth no transgression in Israel: the Lord his God is with him, and the ioyfull shoute of a king is among them. 
\v 22 God brought them out of Egypt: their strength is as an vnicorne. 
\v 23 For there is no sorcerie in Iaakob, nor soothsaying in Israel: according to this time it shalbe sayde of Iaakob and of Israel, What hath God wrought? 
\v 24 Behold, the people shall rise vp as a lyon, and lift vp himselfe as a yong lyon: hee shall not lye downe, till he eate of the pray, and till he drinke the blood of the slayne. 
\v 25 Then Balak sayde vnto Balaam, Neither curse, nor blesse them at all. 
\v 26 But Balaam answered, and saide vnto Balak, Tolde not I thee, saying, All that the Lord speaketh, that must I do? 
\v 27 Againe Balak sayd vnto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I wil bring thee vnto another place, if so be it wil please God, that thou mayest thence curse them for my sake. 
\v 28 So Balak brought Balaam vnto the top of Peor, that looketh toward Ieshmon. 
\v 29 Then Balaam sayde vnto Balak, Make me here seuen altars, and prepare me here seuen bullocks, and seuen rammes. 
\v 30 And Balak did as Balaam had sayd, and offred a bullocke and a ram on euery altar. 
\c 24  
\p
\v 1 When Balaam saw that it pleased the Lord to blesse Israel, then he went not, as certaine times before, to set diuinations, but set his face toward the wildernesse. 
\v 2 And Balaam lift vp his eyes, and looked vpon Israel, which dwelt according to their tribes, and the Spirit of God came vpon him. 
\v 3 And he vttered his parable, and sayd, Balaam the sonne of Beor hath sayde, and the man, whose eyes were shut vp, hath sayd, 
\v 4 He hath sayde, which heard the wordes of God, and sawe the vision of the Almightie, and falling in a traunce had his eyes opened: 
\v 5 How goodly are thy tentes, O Iaakob, and thine habitations, O Israel! 
\v 6 As the valleis, are they stretched forth, as gardes by the riuers side, as the aloe trees, which the Lord hath planted, as the cedars beside the waters. 
\v 7 The water droppeth out of his bucket, and his seede shalbe in many waters, and his king shall be hier then Agag, and his kingdome shall bee exalted. 
\v 8 God brought him out of Egypt: his strength shalbe as an vnicorne: he shall eate the nations his enemies, and bruise their bones, and shoote them through with his arrowes. 
\v 9 He coucheth and lieth downe as a yong lion, and as a lion: who shall stirre him vp? blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that curseth thee. 
\v 10 Then Balak was very angry with Balaam, and smote his handes together: so Balak sayde vnto Balaam, I sent for thee to curse mine enemies, and beholde, thou hast blessed them nowe three times. 
\v 11 Therefore nowe flee vnto thy place: I thought surely to promote thee vnto honour, but loe, the Lord hath kept thee backe from honour. 
\v 12 Then Balaam answered Balak, Tolde I not also thy messengers, which thou sentest vnto me, saying, 
\v 13 If Balak would giue me his house ful of siluer and gold, I can not passe the commandement of the Lord, to doe either good or bad of mine owne minde? what the Lord shall commaund, the same will I speake. 
\v 14 And nowe behold, I goe vnto my people: come, I will aduertise thee what this people shall doe to thy folke in the later dayes. 
\v 15 And he vttered his parable, and sayd, Balaam the sonne of Beor hath sayde, and the man whose eyes were shut vp, hath sayd, 
\v 16 He hath said that heard the words of God, and hath the knowledge of the most High, and sawe the vision of the Almightie, and falling in a traunce had his eyes opened: 
\v 17 I shall see him, but not nowe: I shall behold him, but not neere: there shall come a starre of Iaakob, and a scepter shall rise of Israel, and shall smite the coastes of Moab, and destroy all the sonnes of Sheth. 
\v 18 And Edom shalbe possessed, and Seir shall be a possession to their enemies: but Israel shall do valiantly. 
\v 19 He also that shall haue dominion shall bee of Iaakob, and shall destroy the remnant of the citie. 
\v 20 And when he looked on Amalek, he vttered his parable, and sayd, Amalek was the first of the nations: but his latter ende shall come to destruction. 
\v 21 And he looked on the Kenites, and vttered his parable, and sayde, Strong is thy dwelling place, and put thy nest in the rocke. 
\v 22 Neuerthelesse, the Kenite shalbe spoyled vntill Asshur cary thee away captiue. 
\v 23 Againe he vttered his parable, and sayd, Alas, who shall liue when God doeth this? 
\v 24 The ships also shall come from the coastes of Chittim, and subdue Asshur, and shall subdue Eber, and he also shall come to destruction. 
\v 25 Then Balaam rose vp, and went and returned to his place: and Balak also went his way. 
\c 25  
\p
\v 1 Nowe whiles Israel abode in Shittim, the people began to commit whoredome with the daughters of Moab: 
\v 2 Which called the people vnto the sacrifice of their gods, and the people ate, and bowed downe to their gods. 
\v 3 And Israel coupled himselfe vnto Baal Peor: wherefore the wrath of the Lord was kindled against Israel: 
\v 4 And the Lord sayde vnto Moses, Take all the heades of the people, and hang them vp before the Lord against ye sunne, that the indignation of the Lords wrath may be turned from Israel. 
\v 5 Then Moses sayd vnto the Iudges of Israel, Euery one slay his men that were ioyned vnto Baal Peor. 
\v 6 And behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought vnto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the Congregation of the children of Israel, who wept before the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation. 
\v 7 And when Phinehas the sonne of Eleazar the sonne of Aaron the Priest sawe it, hee rose vp from the middes of the Congregation, and tooke a speare in his hand, 
\v 8 And followed ye man of Israel into the tent, and thrust them both through: to wit, the man of Israel, and the woman, through her belly: so the plague ceased from the children of Israel. 
\v 9 And there died in that plague, foure and twentie thousand. 
\v 10 Then the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 11 Phinehas the sonne of Eleazar, the sonne of Aaron the Priest, hath turned mine anger away from the children of Israel, while hee was zealous for my sake among them: therefore I haue not consumed the children of Israel in my ielousie. 
\v 12 Wherefore say to him, Beholde, I giue vnto him my couenant of peace, 
\v 13 And he shall haue it, and his seede after him, euen the couenant of the priestes office for euer, because he was zealous for his God, and hath made an atonement for the children of Israel. 
\v 14 And the name of the Israelite thus slayne, which was killed with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri the sonne of Salu, prince of the familie of the Simeonites. 
\v 15 And the name of the Midianitish woman, that was slayne, was Cozbi the daughter of Zur, who was head ouer the people of his fathers house in Midian. 
\v 16 Againe ye Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 17 Vexe the Midianites, and smite them: 
\v 18 For they trouble you with their wiles, wherewith they haue beguiled you as concerning Peor, and as concerning their sister Cozbi ye daughter of a prince of Midian, which was slayne in the day of the plague because of Peor. 
\c 26  
\p
\v 1 And so after the plague, the Lord spake vnto Moses, and to Eleazar the sonne of Aaron the Priest, saying, 
\v 2 Take the nomber of all the Congregation of the children of Israel from twentie yeere olde and aboue throughout their fathers houses, all that go forth to warre in Israel. 
\v 3 So Moses and Eleazar the Priest spake vnto them in the plaine of Moab, by Iorden towarde Iericho, saying, 
\v 4 From twentie yeere olde and aboue ye shall nomber the people, as the Lord had commanded Moses, and the childre of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.

\v 9 And the sonnes of Eliab, Nemuel, and Dathan, and Abiram: this Dathan and Abiram were famous in the Congregation, and stroue against Moses and against Aaron in the assemblie of Korah, when they stroue against the Lord. 
\v 10 And the earth opened her mouth, and swalowed them vp with Korah, when the Congregation died, what time the fire consumed, two hundreth and fiftie men, who were for a signe. 
\v 11 Notwithstanding, all the sonnes of Korah dyed not.

\v 54 To many thou shalt giue the more inheritance, and to fewe thou shalt giue lesse inheritance: to euery one according to his nomber shalbe giuen his inheritance. 
\v 55 Notwithstanding, the land shalbe deuided by lot: according to the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherite:

\v 1 Then came the daughters of Zelophehad, the sonne of Hepher, the sonne of Gilead, the sonne of Machir, the sonne of Manasseh, of the familie of Manasseh, the sonne of Ioseph (and the names of his daughters were these, Mahlah, Noah and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah) 
\v 2 And stoode before Moses, and before Eleazar the Priest, and before the Princes, and all the assemblie, at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, saying, 
\v 3 Our father dyed in the wildernes, and he was not among the assemblie of them that were assembled against the Lord in the companie of Korah, but died in his sinne, and had no sonnes. 
\v 4 Wherefore should the name of our father be taken away from among his familie, because he hath no sonne? giue vs a possession among the brethren of our father. 
\v 5 Then Moses brought their cause before the Lord. 
\v 6 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 7 The daughters of Zelophehad speake right: thou shalt giue them a possession to inherite among their fathers brethren, and shalt turne the inheritance of their father vnto them. 
\v 8 Also thou shalt speake vnto the children of Israel, saying, If a man die and haue no sonne, then ye shall turne his inheritaunce vnto his daughter. 
\v 9 And if he haue no daughter, ye shall giue his inheritance vnto his brethren. 
\v 10 And if he haue no brethren, ye shall giue his inheritance vnto his fathers brethren. 
\v 11 And if his father haue no brethren, ye shall giue his inheritance vnto his next kinsman of his familie, and he shall possesse it: and this shall be vnto the children of Israel a law of iudgement, as the Lord hath commanded Moses. 
\v 12 Againe the Lord said vnto Moses, Go vp into this mount of Abarim, and behold ye lande which I haue giuen vnto the children of Israel. 
\v 13 And when thou hast seene it, thou shalt be gathered vnto thy people also, as Aaron thy brother was gathered. 
\v 14 For ye were disobedient vnto my worde in the desert of Zin, in the strife of the assemblie, to sanctifie me in the waters before their eyes. That is the water of Meribah in Kadesh in the wildernesse of Zin. 
\v 15 Then Moses spake vnto the Lord, saying, 
\v 16 Let the Lord God of the spirits of all flesh appoint a man ouer the Congregation, 
\v 17 Who may goe out and in before them, and leade them out and in, that the Congregation of the Lord be not as sheepe, which haue not a shepheard. 
\v 18 And the Lord said vnto Moses, Take thee Ioshua the sonne of Nun, in whom is the Spirite, and put thine handes vpon him, 
\v 19 And set him before Eleazar the Priest, and before all the Congregation, and giue him a charge in their sight. 
\v 20 And giue him of thy glory, that all the Congregation of ye children of Israel may obey. 
\v 21 And he shall stande before Eleazar the Priest, who shall aske counsell for him by the iudgement of Vrim before the Lord: at his worde they shall goe out, and at his worde they shall come in, both he, and all the children of Israel with him and all the Congregation. 
\v 22 So Moses did as the Lord had commanded him, and he tooke Ioshua, and set him before Eleazar the Priest, and before all the Congregation. 
\v 23 Then he put his handes vpon him, and gaue him a charge, as the Lord had spoken by the hand of Moses.

\p
\v 1 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Command the children of Israel, and say vnto them, Ye shall obserue to offer vnto me in their due season mine offering, and my bread, for my sacrifices made by fire for a sweete sauour vnto me. 
\v 3 Also thou shalt say vnto them, This is the offring made by fire which ye shall offer vnto the Lord, two lambes of a yeere olde without spot, daily, for a continuall burnt offring. 
\v 4 One lambe shalt thou prepare in the morning, and the other lambe shalt thou prepare at euen. 
\v 5 And the tenth part of an Ephah of fine floure for a meate offering mingled with the fourth part of an Hin of beaten oyle. 
\v 6 This shalbe a daily burnt offering, as was made in the mount Sinai for a sweete sauour: it is a sacrifice made by fire vnto the Lord. 
\v 7 And the drinke offring thereof the fourth part of an Hin for one lambe: in the holy place cause to powre the drinke offring vnto the Lord. 
\v 8 And the other lambe thou shalt prepare at euen: as the meate offring of the morning, and as the drinke offering thereof shalt thou prepare this for an offring made by fire of sweete sauour vnto the Lord. 
\v 9 But on the Sabbath day ye shall offer two lambes of a yere old, without spot, and two tenth deales of fine floure for a meate offring mingled with oyle, and the drinke offring thereof. 
\v 10 This is ye burnt offring of euery Sabbath, beside the continuall burnt offring, and drinke offring thereof. 
\v 11 And in the beginning of your moneths, ye shall offer a burnt offring vnto the Lord, two yong bullockes, and a ramme, and seuen lambes of a yeere olde, without spot,

\v 13 And a tenth deale of fine floure mingled with oyle for a meate offring vnto one lambe: for a burnt offring of sweete sauour: it is an offring made by fire vnto the Lord. 
\v 14 And their drinke offrings shalbe halfe an Hin of wine vnto one bullocke, and the thirde part of an Hin vnto a ram, and ye fourth part of an Hin vnto a labe: this is the burnt offring of euery moneth, throughout the moneths of the yeere. 
\v 15 And one hee goat for a sinne offring vnto the Lord shalbe prepared, besides the continuall burnt offring, and his drinke offring. 
\v 16 Also the fourtenth day of the first moneth is the Passeouer of the Lord. 
\v 17 And in ye fiftenth day of the same moneth is the feast: seuen dayes shall vnleauened bread be eaten. 
\v 18 In the first day shalbe an holy conuocation, ye shall do no seruile worke therein.

\v 21 One tenth deale shalt thou prepare for euery lambe, euen for the seuen lambes. 
\v 22 And an hee goate for a sinne offering, to make an atonement for you. 
\v 23 Ye shall prepare these, beside the burnt offering in the morning, which is a continuall burnt sacrifice. 
\v 24 After this maner ye shall prepare throughout all the seuen dayes, for the mainteining of the offring made by fire for a sweete sauour vnto the Lord: it shall be done beside the continuall burnt offring and drinke offring thereof. 
\v 25 And in ye seuenth day ye shall haue an holy conuocation, wherein ye shall do no seruile work. 
\v 26 Also in the day of your first fruits, when ye bring a newe meate offring vnto the Lord, according to your weekes ye shall haue an holy conuocation, and ye shall do no seruile worke in it: 
\v 27 But ye shall offer a burnt offering for a sweete sauour vnto the Lord, two yong bullocks, a ramme, and seuen lambes of a yeere olde,

\v 6 Beside the burnt offring of the moneth, and his meat offring, and the continual burnt offring, and his meate offring and the drinke offrings of the same, according to their maner, for a sweete sauour: it is a sacrifice made by fire vnto ye Lord. 
\v 7 And ye shall haue in ye tenth day of the seuenth moneth, an holy conuocation: and ye shall humble your soules, and shall not doe any worke therein: 
\v 8 But ye shall offer a burnt offring vnto the Lord for a sweete sauour: one yong bullocke, a ramme, and seuen lambes of a yeere olde: see they be without blemish. 
\v 9 And their meate offering shall be of fine floure mingled with oyle, three tenth deales to a bullocke, and two tenth deales to a ramme, 
\v 10 One tenth deale vnto euery lambe, thoroughout the seuen lambes, 
\v 11 An hee goate for a sinne offring, (beside ye sinne offring to make the atonement and the continual burnt offring and the meat offring thereof) and their drinke offrings. 
\v 12 And in the fifteenth day of the seuenth moneth ye shall haue an holie conuocation: ye shall do no seruile worke therein, but yee shall keepe a feast vnto the Lord seuen daies.

\v 1 Then Moses spake vnto the children of Israel according to all that the Lord had commanded him, 
\v 2 Moses also spake vnto the heads of ye tribes concerning the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded, 
\v 3 Whosoeuer voweth a vow vnto the Lord, or sweareth an othe to binde him selfe by a bonde, he shall not breake his promise, but shall do according to al that proceedeth out of his mouth. 
\v 4 If a woman also vow a vow vnto the Lord, and binde her selfe by a bonde, being in her fathers house, in the time of her youth, 
\v 5 And her father heare her vowe and bonde, wherewith she hath bound her selfe, and her father hold his peace concerning her, then all her vowes shall stande, and euery bonde, wherewith she hath bound her selfe, shall stand. 
\v 6 But if her father disallow her the same day that he heareth all her vowes and bondes, wherewith she hath bound her selfe, they shall not bee of value, and the Lord will forgiue her, because her father disallowed her. 
\v 7 And if she haue an husband when she voweth or pronounceth ought with her lips, wherewith she bindeth her selfe, 
\v 8 If her husband heard it, and holdeth his peace concerning her, the same day he heareth it, then her vowe shall stande, and her bondes wherewith she bindeth her selfe shall stand in effect. 
\v 9 But if her husband disallow her the same day that hee heareth it, then shall hee make her vowe which shee hath made, and that that shee hath pronounced with her lips, wherewith shee bound her selfe, of none effect: and the Lord will forgiue her. 
\v 10 But euery vowe of a widowe, and of her that is diuorced (wherewith she hath bound her selfe) shall stand in effect with her. 
\v 11 And if she vowed in her husbands house, or bound her selfe streightly with an othe, 
\v 12 And her husband hath heard it, and helde his peace cocerning her, not disalowing her, then all her vowes shall stand, and euery bond, wherewith she bound her selfe, shall stand in effect. 
\v 13 But if her husband disanulled them, the same day that he heard them, nothing that proceeded out of her lippes concerning her vowes or concerning her bondes, shall stand in effect: for her husband hath disanulled them: and the Lord will forgiue her. 
\v 14 So euery vowe, and euery othe or bonde, made to humble the soule, her husband may stablish it, or her husband may breake it. 
\v 15 But if her husband holde his peace concerning her from day to day, then he stablisheth al her vowes and all her bondes which shee hath made: hee hath confirmed them because he held his peace concerning her the same day that hee hearde them. 
\v 16 But if he breake them after that he hath heard them, then shall he beare her iniquitie. 
\v 17 These are the ordinances which the Lord commanded Moses, betweene a man and his wife, and betweene the father and his daughter, being young in her fathers house.

\p
\v 1 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Reuenge the children of Israel of the Midianites, and afterwarde shalt thou be gathered vnto thy people. 
\v 3 And Moses spake to the people, saying, Harnesse some of you vnto warre, and let them goe against Midian, to execute the vengeance of the Lord against Midian. 
\v 4 A thousande of euery tribe throughout all the tribes of Israel, shall ye sende to the warre. 
\v 5 So there were taken out of the thousands of Israel, twelue thousande prepared vnto warre, of euery tribe a thousand. 
\v 6 And Moses sent them to the warre, euen a thousand of euery tribe, and sent them with Phinehas the sonne of Eleazar the Priest to the warre: and the holy instruments, that is, the trumpets to blow were in his hand. 
\v 7 And they warred against Midian, as the Lord had commanded Moses, and slue all the males. 
\v 8 They slue also the Kings of Midian among them that were slaine: Eui and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur and Reba fiue kings of Midian, and they slue Balaam the sonne of Beor with the sworde: 
\v 9 But the children of Israel tooke the women of Midian prisoners, and their children, and spoyled all their cattell, and all their flockes, and all their goods. 
\v 10 And they burnt all their cities, wherein they dwelt, and all their villages with fire. 
\v 11 And they tooke all the spoyle and all the pray both of men and beastes. 
\v 12 And they brought the captiues and that which they had taken, and the spoyle vnto Moses and to Eleazar the Priest, and vnto the Congregation of the children of Israel, into ye campe in the playne of Moab, which was by Iorden toward Iericho. 
\v 13 Then Moses and Eleazar the Priest, and all the princes of the Congregation went out of the campe to meete them. 
\v 14 And Moses was angry with the captaines of the hoste, with the captaines ouer thousands, and captaines ouer hundreds, which came from the warre and battel. 
\v 15 And Moses sayde vnto them, What? haue ye saued all the women? 
\v 16 Behold, these caused the children of Israel through the counsell of Balaam to commit a trespasse against the Lord, as concerning Peor, and there came a plague among the Congregation of the Lord. 
\v 17 Now therefore, slay all the males among the children, and kill all the women that haue knowen man by carnall copulation. 
\v 18 But all the women children that haue not knowen carnall copulation, keepe aliue for your selues. 
\v 19 And ye shall remaine without the host seuen dayes, all that haue killed any person, and all that haue touched any dead, and purifie both your selues and your prisoners the third day and the seuenth. 
\v 20 Also ye shall purifie euery garment and all that is made of skins and al worke of goates heare, and all things made of wood. 
\v 21 And Eleazar ye Priest sayd vnto the men of warre, which went to the battel, This is the ordinance of the law which the Lord commanded Moses, 
\v 22 As for gold, and siluer, brasse, yron, tynne, and lead: 
\v 23 Euen all that may abide the fire, yee shall make it goe through the fire, and it shalbe cleane: yet, it shalbe purified with the water of purification: and all that suffereth not the fire, yee shall cause to passe by the water. 
\v 24 Ye shall wash also your clothes the seuenth day, and ye shalbe cleane: and afterward ye shall come into the Hoste. 
\v 25 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 26 Take the summe of the praie that was taken, both of persons and of cattell, thou and Eleazar the Priest, and the chiefe fathers of the Congregation. 
\v 27 And deuide the praye betweene the souldiers that went to the warre, and all the Congregation. 
\v 28 And thou shalt take a tribute vnto ye Lord of the men of warre, which went out to battel: one person of fiue hundreth, both of the persons, and of the beeues, and of the asses, and of the sheepe. 
\v 29 Yee shall take it of their halfe and giue it vnto Eleazar the Priest, as an heaue offring of the Lord. 
\v 30 But of the halfe of the children of Israel thou shalt take one, taken out of fiftie, both of the persons, of the beeues, of the asses, and of the sheepe, euen of all the cattel: and thou shalt giue them vnto the Leuites, which haue the charge of the Tabernacle of the Lord. 
\v 31 And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the Lord had commanded Moses. 
\v 32 And the bootie, to wit, the rest of the praie which the men of warre had spoyled, was sixe hundreth seuentie and fiue thousand sheepe, 
\v 33 And seuentie and two thousand beeues, 
\v 34 And three score and one thousand asses, 
\v 35 And two and thirtie thousande persons in all, of women that had lyen by no man. 
\v 36 And the halfe, to wit, the part of them that went out to warre touching the nomber of sheepe, was three hundreth seuen and thirtie thousand, and fiue hundreth. 
\v 37 And the Lordes tribute of the sheepe was sixe hundreth and seuentie and fiue: 
\v 38 And the beeues were six and thirty thousad, whereof the Lordes tribute was seuentie and two. 
\v 39 And the asses were thirtie thousande and fiue hundreth, whereof the Lordes tribute was three score and one: 
\v 40 And of persons sixtene thousand, whereof the Lordes tribute was two and thirtie persons. 
\v 41 And Moses gaue the tribute of the Lordes offring vnto Eleazar the Priest, as the Lord had commanded Moses. 
\v 42 And of the halfe of the children of Israel, which Moses deuided from the men of warre, 
\v 43 (For the halfe that perteined vnto the Congregation, was three hundreth thirtie and seuen thousand sheepe and fiue hundreth, 
\v 44 And sixe and thirtie thousand beeues, 
\v 45 And thirtie thousand asses, and fiue hudreth, 
\v 46 And sixteene thousande persons) 
\v 47 Moses, I say, tooke of the halfe that perteined vnto the children of Israel, one taken out of fiftie, both of the persons, and of the cattell, and gaue them vnto the Leuites, which haue the charge of the Tabernacle of the Lord, as the Lord had commanded Moses. 
\v 48 Then the captaines which were ouer thousandes of the hoste, the captaines ouer the thousandes, and the captaines ouer the hundreds came vnto Moses: 
\v 49 And saide to Moses, Thy seruants haue taken the summe of the men of warre which are vnder our authoritie, and there lacketh not one man of vs. 
\v 50 We haue therefore brought a present vnto the Lord, what euery man found of iewels of golde, bracelets, and cheines, rings, eare ringes, and ornaments of the legges, to make an atonement for our soules before the Lord. 
\v 51 And Moses and Eleazar the Priest tooke the golde of them, and all wrought iewels, 
\v 52 And all the golde of the offring that they offered vp to the Lord (of the captaines ouer thousands and hundreds) was sixteene thousande seuen hundreth and fiftie shekels, 
\v 53 (For the men of warre had spoyled, euery man for him selfe) 
\v 54 And Moses and Eleazar the Priest tooke the golde of the captaines ouer the thousandes, and ouer the hundreds, and brought it into the Tabernacle of the Congregation, for a memoriall of the children of Israel before the Lord. 
\c 32  
\p
\v 1 Nowe the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad had an exceeding great multitude of cattell: and they sawe the lande of Iazer, and the lande of Gilead, that it was an apt place for cattel. 
\v 2 Then the children of Gad, and the childre of Reuben came, and spake vnto Moses and to Eleazar the Priest, and vnto the princes of the Congregation, saying, 
\v 3 The land of Ataroth, and Dibon, and Iazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon, 
\v 4 Which countrey the Lord smote before the Congregation of Israel, is a lande meete for cattell, and thy seruants haue cattell: 
\v 5 Wherefore, said they, if we haue foud grace in thy sight, let this lande be giuen vnto thy seruants for a possession, and bring vs not ouer Iorde. 
\v 6 And Moses said vnto the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren goe to warre, and ye tary heere? 
\v 7 Wherefore now discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel, to goe ouer into the lande, which the Lord hath giuen them? 
\v 8 Thus did your fathers when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the lande. 
\v 9 For when they went vp euen vnto the riuer of Eshcol, and sawe the land: they discouraged the heart of the childre of Israel, that they woulde not goe into the lande, which the Lord had giuen them. 
\v 10 And the Lordes wrath was kindled the same day, and he did sweare, saying, 
\v 11 None of the men that came out of Egypt from twentie yeere olde and aboue, shall see the land for the which I sware vnto Abraham, to Izhak, and to Iaakob, because they haue not wholly followed me: 
\v 12 Except Caleb the sonne of Iephunneh the Kenesite, and Ioshua the sonne of Nun: for they haue constantly followed the Lord. 
\v 13 And the Lord was very angry with Israel, and made them wander in the wildernesse fourty yeeres, vntill all the generation that had done euill in the sight of the Lord were consumed. 
\v 14 And behold, ye are risen vp in your fathers steade as an encrease of sinfull men, still to augment the fierce wrath of the Lord, toward Israel. 
\v 15 For if ye turne away from following him, he will yet againe leaue the people in the wildernesse, and ye shall destroy all this folke. 
\v 16 And they went neere to him, and said, We will builde sheepe foldes here for our sheepe, and for our cattell, and cities for our children. 
\v 17 But we our selues will be readie armed to go before the children of Israel, vntill we haue brought them vnto their place: but our childre shall dwell in the defenced cities, because of the inhabitants of the lande. 
\v 18 We will not returne vnto our houses, vntil the children of Israel haue inherited, euery man his inheritance. 
\v 19 Neither wil we inherite with them beyond Iorden and on that side, because our inheritance is fallen to vs on this side Iorden Eastwarde. 
\v 20 And Moses saide vnto them, If ye will doe this thing, and goe armed before the Lord to warre: 
\v 21 And will goe euery one of you in harnesse ouer Iorden before the Lord, vntill he hath cast out his enemies from his sight: 
\v 22 And vntill the land be subdued before the Lord, then ye shall returne and be innocent toward the Lord, and toward Israel: and this land shalbe your possession before the Lord. 
\v 23 But if ye will not doe so, beholde, ye haue sinned against the Lord, and be sure, that your sinne will finde you out. 
\v 24 Builde you then cities for your children and folds for your sheepe, and do that ye haue spoke. 
\v 25 Then the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake vnto Moses, saying, Thy seruats will doe as my lorde commandeth: 
\v 26 Our childre, our wiues, our sheepe, and al our cattell shall remaine there in the cities of Gilead, 
\v 27 But thy seruants will goe euery one armed to warre before the Lord for to fight, as my lorde saith. 
\v 28 So concerning them, Moses commanded Eleazar the Priest, and Ioshua the sonne of Nun, and the chiefe fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel: 
\v 29 And Moses said vnto them, If the children of Gad, and the children of Reuben, will go with you ouer Iorden, all armed to fight before the Lord, then when the land is subdued before you, ye shall giue the the lad of Gilead for a possessio: 
\v 30 But if they will not goe ouer with you armed, then they shall haue their possessions amog you in the land of Canaan. 
\v 31 And the children of Gad, and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As the Lord hath said vnto thy seruants, so will we doe. 
\v 32 We will goe armed before the Lord into the lande of Canaan: that the possession of our inheritance may be to vs on this side Iorden. 
\v 33 So Moses gaue vnto them, euen to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and to halfe the tribe of Manasseh the sonne of Ioseph, the kingdome of Sihon King of the Amorites, and the kingdome of Og King of Bashan, the lande with the cities thereof and coastes, euen the cities of the countrey round about. 
\v 34 Then the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer, 
\v 35 And Atroth, Shophan, and Iazer, and Iogbehah, 
\v 36 And Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran, defenced cities: also sheepe foldes. 
\v 37 And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kiriathaim, 
\v 38 And Nebo, and Baal-meon, and turned their names, and Shibmah: and gaue other names vnto the cities which they built. 
\v 39 And the children of Machir the sonne of Manasseh went to Gilead, and tooke it, and put out the Amorites that dwelt therein. 
\v 40 Then Moses gaue Gilead vnto Machir the sonne of Manasseh, and he dwelt therein. 
\v 41 And Iair the sonne of Manasseh went and tooke the small townes thereof, and called them Hauoth Iair. 
\v 42 Also Nobah went and tooke Kenath, with the villages thereof and called it Nobah, after his owne name.

\v 1 These are the iourneyes of the children of Israel, which went out of the land of Egypt according to their bands vnder the hand of Moses and Aaron. 
\v 2 And Moses wrote their going out by their iourneies according to ye commandement of the Lord: so these are ye iourneies of their going out. 
\v 3 Nowe they departed from Rameses the first moneth, euen the fifteenth day of the first moneth, on the morowe after the Passeouer: and the children of Israel went out with an hie hand in the sight of all the Egyptians. 
\v 4 (For the Egyptians buried all their first borne, which the Lord had smitten among them: vpon their gods also the Lord did execution.) 
\v 5 And the children of Israel remoued from Rameses, and pitched in Succoth. 
\v 6 And they departed from Succoth, and pitched in Etham, which is in the edge of the wildernesse. 
\v 7 And they remoued from Etham, and turned againe vnto Pi-hahiroth, which is before Baal-zephon, and pitched before Migdol. 
\v 8 And they departed from before Hahiroth, and went through the middes of the Sea into the wildernesse, and went three dayes iourney in the wildernesse of Etham, and pitched in Marah. 
\v 9 And they remoued from Marah, and came vnto Elim, and in Elim were twelue fountaines of water, and seuentie palme trees, and they pitched there. 
\v 10 And they remoued from Elim, and camped by the red Sea. 
\v 11 And they remoued from the red Sea, and lay in the wildernesse of Sin. 
\v 12 And they tooke their iourney out of the wildernesse of Sin, and set vp their tentes in Dophkah. 
\v 13 And they departed from Dophkah, and lay in Alush. 
\v 14 And they remoued from Alush, and lay in Rephidim, where was no water for the people to drinke. 
\v 15 And they departed from Rephidim, and pitched in the wildernesse of Sinai. 
\v 16 And they remoued from the desert of Sinai, and pitched in Kibroth Hattaauah.

\v 23 And they went from Kehelathah, and pitched in mount Shapher. 
\v 24 And they remoued from mount Shapher, and lay in Haradah. 
\v 25 And they remoued from Haradah, and pitched in Makheloth. 
\v 26 And they remoued from Makheloth, and lay in Tahath. 
\v 27 And they departed from Tahath, and pitched in Tarah. 
\v 28 And they remoued from Tarah, and pitched in Mithkah. 
\v 29 And they went from Mithkah, and pitched in Hashmonah. 
\v 30 And they departed from Hashmonah, and lay in Moseroth. 
\v 31 And they departed from Moseroth, and pitched in Bene-iaakan. 
\v 32 And they remoued from Bene-iaakan, and lay in Hor-hagidgad. 
\v 33 And they went from Hor-hagidgad, and pitched in Iotbathah. 
\v 34 And they remoued from Iotbathah, and lay in Ebronah. 
\v 35 And they departed from Ebronah, and lay in Ezion-gaber. 
\v 36 And they remoued from Ezion-gaber, and pitched in the wildernesse of Zin, which is Kadesh. 
\v 37 And they remooued from Kadesh, and pitched in mount Hor, in the edge of the land of Edom. 
\v 38 (And Aaron the Priest went vp into mount Hor, at the commandement of the Lord, and died there, in the fourtieth yeere after the children of Israel were come out of the lande of Egypt, in the first day of the fifth moneth. 
\v 39 And Aaron was an hundreth, and three and twentie yeere olde, when hee dyed in mount Hor. 
\v 40 And King Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the South of the land of Canaan, heard of the comming of the children of Israel) 
\v 41 And they departed from mount Hor, and pitched in Zalmonah. 
\v 42 And they departed from Zalmonah, and pitched in Punon. 
\v 43 And they departed from Punon, and pitched in Oboth.

\v 45 And they departed from Iim, and pitched in Dibon-gad. 
\v 46 And they remooued from Dibon-gad, and lay in Almon-diblathaim. 
\v 47 And they remooued from Almon-diblathaim, and pitched in the mountaines of Abarim before Nebo. 
\v 48 And they departed from the mountaines of Abarim, and pitched in the plaine of Moab, by Iorden toward Iericho. 
\v 49 And they pitched by Iorden, from Bethieshimoth vnto Abel-shittim in the playne of Moab. 
\v 50 And the Lord spake vnto Moses in the playne of Moab, by Iorden towarde Iericho, saying, 
\v 51 Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say vnto them, When ye are come ouer Iorden to enter into the land of Canaan, 
\v 52 Ye shall then driue out all the inhabitants of the land before you, and destroy all their pictures, and breake asunder all their images of metall, and plucke downe all their hie places. 
\v 53 And ye shall possesse the lande and dwell therein: for I haue giue you ye land to possesse it. 
\v 54 And ye shall inherite the land by lot according to your families: to the more yee shall giue more inheritance, and to the fewer the lesse inheritance. Where the lot shall fall to any man, that shall be his: according to the tribes of your fathers shall ye inherite. 
\v 55 But if ye will not driue out the inhabitants of the land before you, then those which yee let ramaine of them, shalbe prickes in your eyes, and thornes in your sides, and shall vexe you in the land wherein ye dwell. 
\v 56 Moreouer, it shall come to passe, that I shall doe vnto you, as I thought to do vnto them. 
\c 34  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Commande the children of Israel, and say vnto them, When yee come into the land of Canaan, this is the land that shall fall vnto your inheritance: that is, the land of Canaan with the coastes thereof. 
\v 3 And your Southquarter shalbe from the wildernesse of Zin to the borders of Edom: so that your Southquarter shall be from the salt Sea coast Eastwarde: 
\v 4 And the border shall compasse you from the South to Maaleh-akrabbim, and reach to Zin, and goe out from the South to Kadesh-barnea: thence it shall stretch to Hazar-addar, and go along to Azmon. 
\v 5 And the border shall compasse from Azmon vnto the riuer of Egypt, and shall goe out to the Sea. 
\v 6 And your Westquarter shall bee the great Sea: euen that border shalbe your Westcoast. 
\v 7 And this shall bee your Northquarter: yee shall marke out your border from the great Sea vnto mount Hor. 
\v 8 From mount Hor ye shall point out till it come vnto Hamath, and the end of the coast shall be at Zedad. 
\v 9 And the coast shall reach out to Ziphron, and goe out at Hazar-enan. this shalbe your Northquarter. 
\v 10 And ye shall marke out your Eastquarter from Hazar-enan to Shepham. 
\v 11 And the coast shall goe downe from Shepham to Riblah, and from the Eastside of Ain: and the same border shall descend and goe out at the side of the sea of Chinneereth Eastward. 
\v 12 Also that border shall goe downe to Iorden, and leaue at the salt Sea. this shalbe your land with the coastes thereof round about. 
\v 13 Then Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This is the lande which yee shall inherite by lot, which the Lord commanded to giue vnto nine tribes and halfe the tribe. 
\v 14 For the tribe of the children of Reuben, according to the housholdes of their fathers, and the tribe of the children of Gad, according to their fathers housholdes, and halfe the tribe of Manasseh, haue receiued their inheritance. 
\v 15 Two tribes and an halfe tribe haue receiued their inheritance on this side of Iorden toward Iericho full East. 
\v 16 Againe the Lord spake to Moses, saying, 
\v 17 These are the names of the men which shall deuide ye land vnto you: Eleazar the Priest, and Ioshua the sonne of Nun. 
\v 18 And ye shall take also a prince of euerie tribe to deuide the land. 
\v 19 The names also of the men are these: Of the tribe of Iudah, Caleb ye sonne of Iephunneh. 
\v 20 And of the tribe of the sonnes of Simeon, Shemuel the sonne of Ammihud. 
\v 21 Of the tribe of Beniamin, Elidad the sonne of Chislon. 
\v 22 Also of the tribe of the sonnes of Dan, the prince Bukki, the sonne of Iogli. 
\v 23 Of the sonnes of Ioseph: of the tribe of the sonnes of Manasseh, the prince Hanniel the sonne of Ephod. 
\v 24 And of the tribe of the sonnes of Ephraim, the prince Kemuel, the sonne of Shiphtan. 
\v 25 Of the tribe also of the sonnes of Zebulun, the prince Elizaphan, the sonne of Parnach. 
\v 26 So of the tribe of the sonnes of Issachar, the prince Paltiel the sonne of Azzan. 
\v 27 Of the tribe also of the sonnes of Asher, the prince Ahihud, the sonne of Shelomi. 
\v 28 And of the tribe of the sonnes of Naphtali, the prince Pedahel, the sonne of Ammihud. 
\v 29 These are they, whome the Lord commanded to deuide the inheritance vnto the children of Israel, in the land of Canaan. 
\c 35  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spake vnto Moses in the plaine of Moab by Iorden, toward Iericho, saying, 
\v 2 Commande ye children of Israel, that they giue vnto the Leuites of the inheritace of their possession, cities to dwell in: yee shall giue also vnto the Leuites the suburbes of the cities round about them. 
\v 3 So they shall haue the cities to dwell in, and their suburbes shall be for their cattell, and for their substance, and for all their beasts. 
\v 4 And the suburbes of the cities, which ye shall giue vnto the Leuites, from the wall of the citie outward, shalbe a thousand cubites round about. 
\v 5 And yee shall measure without the citie of the Eastside, two thousand cubites: and of the Southside, two thousand cubites: and of the Westside, two thousand cubites: and of ye Northside, two thousand cubites: and the citie shalbe in ye middes. this shalbe the measure of the suburbes of their cities. 
\v 6 And of the cities which yee shall giue vnto the Leuites, there shalbe sixe cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint, that he which killeth, may flee thither: and to them yee shall adde two and fourtie cities more. 
\v 7 All the cities which yee shall giue to the Leuites, shalbe eight and fourtie cities: them shall ye giue with their suburbes. 
\v 8 And concerning the cities which yee shall giue, of the possession of the children of Israel: of many ye shall take more, and of few ye shall take lesse: euery one shall giue of his cities vnto the Leuites, according to his inheritance, which hee inheriteth. 
\v 9 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 10 Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say vnto them, When ye be come ouer Iorden into the land of Canaan, 
\v 11 Ye shall appoint you cities, to bee cities of refuge for you, that the slayer, which slayeth any person vnwares, may flee thither. 
\v 12 And these cities shalbe for you a refuge from the auenger, that he which killeth, die not, vntill he stand before the Congregation in iudgement. 
\v 13 And of the cities which ye shall giue, sixe cities shall ye haue for refuge. 
\v 14 Ye shall appoint three on this side Iorden, and ye shall appoint three cities in the lande of Canaan which shalbe cities of refuge. 
\v 15 These six cities shalbe a refuge for the children of Israel, and for the stranger, and for him that dwelleth among you, that euery one which killeth any person vnwares, may flee thither. 
\v 16 And if one smite another with an instrument of yron that hee die, hee is a murtherer, and the murtherer shall die the death. 
\v 17 Also if hee smite him by casting a stone, wherewith hee may be slaine, and he die, hee is a murtherer, and the murtherer shall die the death. 
\v 18 Or if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood, wherewith he may be slaine, if he die, he is a murtherer, and the murtherer shall die the death. 
\v 19 The reuenger of the blood himselfe shall slay the murtherer: when he meeteth him, he shall slay him. 
\v 20 But if hee thrust him of hate, or hurle at him by laying of wait, that he die, 
\v 21 Or smite him through enimitie with his hand, that he die, he that smote him shall die ye death: for hee is a murtherer: the reuenger of the blood shall slay the murtherer when he meeteth him. 
\v 22 But if he pusshed him vnaduisedly, and not of hatred, or cast vpon him any thing, without laying of waite, 
\v 23 Or any stone (whereby he might be slaine) and sawe him not, or caused it to fall vpon him, and he die, and was not his enemie, neither sought him any harme, 
\v 24 Then the Congregation shall iudge betweene the slayer and the auenger of blood according to these lawes. 
\v 25 And the Congregation shall deliuer the slayer out of the hande of the auenger of blood, and the Congregation shall restore him vnto the citie of his refuge, whither hee was fled: and hee shall abide there vnto the death of the hie Priest, which is anointed with the holy oyle. 
\v 26 But if the slayer come without the borders of the citie of his refuge, whither he was fled, 
\v 27 And the reuenger of blood finde him without the borders of the citie of his refuge, and the reueger of blood slay ye murtherer, he shalbe giltles, 
\v 28 Because he should haue remained in the citie of his refuge, vntill the death of the hie Priest: and after the death of the hie Priest, the slayer shall returne vnto the land of his possession. 
\v 29 So these thinges shall be a lawe of iudgement vnto you, throughout your generations in all your dwellings. 
\v 30 Whosoeuer killeth any person, the Iudge shall slay the murtherer, through witnesses: but one witnesse shall not testifie against a person to cause him to die. 
\v 31 Moreouer ye shall take no recompense for the life of the murtherer, which is worthy to die: but he shalbe put to death. 
\v 32 Also ye shall take no recompense for him that is fled to the citie of his refuge, that he should come againe, and dwell in the lande, before the death of the hie Priest. 
\v 33 So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye shall dwell: for blood defileth the land: and the land cannot be clensed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it. 
\v 34 Defile not therefore the lande which yee shall inhabite, For I dwell in the middes thereof: for I the Lord dwel among the children of Israel. 
\c 36  
\p
\v 1 Then the chiefe fathers of the familie of the sonnes of Gilead, the sonne of Machir, the sonne of Manasseh, of the families of the sones of Ioseph, came, and spake before Moses, and before the princes, the chiefe fathers of the children of Israel, 
\v 2 And saide, The Lord commanded my lord to giue the land to inherit by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by the Lord, to giue the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother vnto his daughters. 
\v 3 If they bee married to any of the sonnes of the other tribes of the children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of our fathers, and shalbe put vnto the inheritance of the tribe whereof they shalbe: so shall it be taken away from the lot of our inheritance. 
\v 4 Also when the Iubile of the children of Israel commeth, then shall their inheritance be put vnto the inheritance of the tribe whereof they shall be: so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers. 
\v 5 Then Moses commanded the children of Israel, according to the word of the Lord, saying, The tribe of the sonnes of Ioseph haue said well. 
\v 6 This is the thing that the Lord hath commanded, concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, They shall be wiues, to whome they thinke best, onely to the familie of the tribe of their father shall they marry: 
\v 7 So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remoue from tribe to tribe, for euery one of the children of Israel shall ioyne himselfe to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers. 
\v 8 And euery daughter that possesseth any inheritance of the tribes of the children of Israel, shalbe wife vnto one of the familie of the tribe of her father: that the children of Israel may enioye euery man the inheritance of their fathers. 
\v 9 Neither shall the inheritance go about from tribe to tribe: but euery one of the tribes of the childre of Israel shall sticke to his own inheritace. 
\v 10 As the Lord commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad. 
\v 11 For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah the daughters of Zelophehad were married vnto their fathers brothers sonnes, 
\v 12 They were wiues to certaine of the families of the sonnes of Manasseh the sonne of Ioseph: so their inheritance remained in the tribe of the familie of their father. 
\v 13 These are the commandements and lawes which the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses, vnto the children of Israel in the plaine of Moab, by Iorden toward Iericho.
