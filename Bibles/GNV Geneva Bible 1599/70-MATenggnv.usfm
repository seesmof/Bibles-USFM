\v 1 The booke of the generation of Jesus Christ the sonne of Dauid, the sonne of Abraham. 
\v 2 Abraham begate Isaac. And Isaac begate Iacob. And Iacob begat Iudas and his brethren. 
\v 3 And Iudas begate Phares, and Zara of Thamar. And Phares begate Esrom. And Esrom begate Aram. 
\v 4 And Aram begate Aminadab. And Aminadab begate Naasson. And Naasson begat Salmon. 
\v 5 And Salmon begate Booz of Rachab. And Booz begat Obed of Ruth. and Obed begat Iesse. 
\v 6 And Iesse begate Dauid the King. And Dauid the King begate Salomon of her that was the wife of Vrias. 
\v 7 And Salomon begate Roboam. And Roboam begate Abia. And Abia begate Asa. 
\v 8 And Asa begate Iosaphat. And Iosaphat begate Ioram. And Ioram begate Hozias. 
\v 9 And Hozias begat Ioatham. And Ioatham begate Achaz. And Achaz begate Ezekias. 
\v 10 And Ezekias begate Manasses. And Manasses begate Amon. And Amon begate Iosias. 
\v 11 And Iosias begate Iakim. And Iakim begate Iechonias and his brethren about the time they were caried away to Babylon. 
\v 12 And after they were caried away into Babylon, Iechonias begate Salathiel. And Salathiel begate Zorobabel. 
\v 13 And Zorobabel begate Abiud. And Abiud begate Eliacim. And Eliacim begate Azor. 
\v 14 And Azor begate Sadoc. And Sadoc begate Achim. And Achim begate Eliud. 
\v 15 And Eliud begate Eleazar. And Eleazar begate Matthan. And Matthan begate Iacob. 
\v 16 And Iacob begat Ioseph ye husband of Mary, of whom was borne Jesus, that is called Christ. 
\v 17 So all the generations from Abraham to Dauid, are fourtene generations. And from Dauid vntil they were caried away into Babylon, fourtene generations: and after they were caried away into Babylon vntill Christ, fourteene generations. 
\v 18 Nowe the birth of Jesus Christ was thus, When as his mother Mary was betrothed to Ioseph, before they came together, shee was found with childe of the holy Ghost. 
\v 19 Then Ioseph her husband being a iust man, and not willing to make her a publike example, was minded to put her away secretly. 
\v 20 But whiles he thought these things, behold, the Angel of the Lord appeared vnto him in a dreame, saying, Ioseph, the sonne of Dauid, feare not to take Mary thy wife: for that which is conceiued in her, is of the holy Ghost. 
\v 21 And she shall bring foorth a sonne, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for hee shall saue his people from their sinnes. 
\v 22 And al this was done that it might be fulfilled, which is spoken of the Lord by ye Prophet, saying, 
\v 23 Behold, a virgine shalbe with childe, and shall beare a sonne, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which is by interpretation, God with vs. 
\v 24 Then Ioseph, being raised from sleepe, did as the Angel of the Lord had inioyned him, and tooke his wife. 
\v 25 But he knew her not, til she had broght forth her first borne sonne, and he called his name JESUS. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 When Jesus then was borne at Bethleem in Iudea, in the dayes of Herod the King, beholde, there came Wisemen from the East to Hierusalem, 
\v 2 Saying, Where is that King of the Iewes that is borne? for wee haue seene his starre in the East, and are come to worship him. 
\v 3 When King Herod heard this, he was troubled, and all Hierusalem with him. 
\v 4 And gathering together all the chiefe Priestes and Scribes of the people, hee asked of them, where Christ should be borne. 
\v 5 And they saide vnto him, At Beth-leem in Iudea: for so it is written by the Prophet, 
\v 6 And thou Beth-leem in the lande of Iuda, art not the least among the Princes of Iuda: For out of thee shall come the gouernour that shall feede that my people Israel. 
\v 7 Then Herod priuily called the Wisemen, and diligently inquired of them the time of the starre that appeared, 
\v 8 And sent them to Beth-leem, saying, Goe, and searche diligently for the babe: and when ye haue founde him, bring mee worde againe, that I may come also, and worship him. 
\v 9 So when they had heard the King, they departed: and loe, the starre which they had seene in the East, went before them, till it came and stoode ouer the place where the babe was. 
\v 10 And when they sawe the starre, they reioyced with an exceeding great ioy, 
\v 11 And went into the house, and founde the babe with Mary his mother, and fell downe, and worshipped him, and opened their treasures, and presented vnto him giftes, euen golde, and frankincense, and myrrhe. 
\v 12 And after they were warned of God in a dreame, that they should not go againe to Herod, they returned into their countrey another way. 
\v 13 After their departure, behold, the Angel of the Lord appeareth to Ioseph in a dreame, saying, Arise, and take the babe and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be there til I bring thee word: for Herod will seeke the babe, to destroy him. 
\v 14 So he arose and tooke the babe and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt, 
\v 15 And was there vnto the death of Herod, that that might be fulfilled, which is spoken of the Lord by the Prophet, saying, Out of Egypt haue I called my sonne. 
\v 16 Then Herod, seeing that he was mocked of the Wisemen, was exceeding wroth, and sent foorth, and slew all the male children that were in Beth-leem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two yeere old and vnder, according to the time which he had diligently searched out of the Wisemen. 
\v 17 Then was that fulfilled which is spoken by the Prophet Ieremias, saying, 
\v 18 In Rhama was a voyce heard, mourning, and weeping, and great howling: Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they were not. 
\v 19 And whe Herod was dead, behold, an Angel of the Lord appeareth in a dreame to Ioseph in Egypt, 
\v 20 Saying, Arise, and take the babe and his mother, and goe into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the babes life. 
\v 21 Then he arose vp and tooke the babe and his mother, and came into the land of Israel. 
\v 22 But whe he heard that Archelaus did reigne in Iudea in stead of his father Herod, he was afraide to go thither: yet after he was warned of God in a dreame, he turned aside into the parts of Galile, 
\v 23 And went and dwelt in a citie called Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophets, which was, That hee should be called a Nazarite. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 And in those dayes, Iohn the Baptist came and preached in the wildernes of Iudea, 
\v 2 And said, Repent: for the kingdome of heauen is at hand. 
\v 3 For this is he of whome it is spoken by the Prophet Esaias, saying, The voyce of him that crieth in the wildernes, Prepare ye the way of the Lord: make his pathes straight. 
\v 4 And this Iohn had his garment of camels heare, and a girdle of a skinne about his loynes: his meate was also locusts and wilde hony. 
\v 5 Then went out to him Ierusalem and all Iudea, and all the region rounde about Iordan. 
\v 6 And they were baptized of him in Iordan, confessing their sinnes. 
\v 7 Now when he sawe many of the Pharises, and of the Sadduces come to his baptisme, he said vnto them, O generations of vipers, who hath forewarned you to flee from the anger to come? 
\v 8 Bring foorth therefore fruite worthy amendment of life. 
\v 9 And thinke not to say with your selues, We haue Abraham to our father: for I say vnto you, that God is able euen of these stones to raise vp children vnto Abraham. 
\v 10 And now also is the axe put to the roote of the trees: therfore euery tree which bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewen downe, and cast into ye fire. 
\v 11 In deede I baptize you with water to amendment of life, but he that commeth after me, is mightier then I, whose shoes I am not worthie to beare: hee will baptize you with the holy Ghost, and with fire. 
\v 12 Which hath his fanne in his hand, and wil make cleane his floore, and gather his wheate into his garner, but will burne vp the chaffe with vnquenchable fire. 
\v 13 Then came Iesus from Galile to Iordan vnto Iohn, to be baptized of him. 
\v 14 But Iohn earnestly put him backe, saying, I haue neede to be baptized of thee, and commest thou to me? 
\v 15 Then Iesus answering, saide to him, Let be nowe: for thus it becommeth vs to fulfill all righteousnes. So he suffered him. 
\v 16 And Iesus when hee was baptized, came straight out of the water. And lo, the heaues were opened vnto him, and Iohn saw the Spirit of God descending like a doue, and lighting vpon him. 
\v 17 And loe, a voyce came from heauen, saying, This is my beloued Sonne, in whome I am well pleased. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 Then was Iesus led aside of the Spirit into the wildernes, to be tempted of the deuil. 
\v 2 And when he had fasted fourtie dayes, and fourtie nights, he was afterward hungrie. 
\v 3 Then came to him the tempter, and said, If thou be the Sonne of God, commande that these stones be made bread. 
\v 4 But he answering said, It is written, Man shall not liue by bread onely, but by euery worde that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. 
\v 5 Then the deuil tooke him vp into the holy Citie, and set him on a pinacle of the temple, 
\v 6 And said vnto him, If thou be the Sonne of God, cast thy selfe downe: for it is written, that he wil giue his Angels charge ouer thee, and with their hands they shall lift thee vp, lest at any time thou shouldest dash thy foote against a stone. 
\v 7 Iesus saide vnto him, It is written againe, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. 
\v 8 Againe the deuil tooke him vp into an exceeding hie mountaine, and shewed him all the kingdomes of the world, and the glory of them, 
\v 9 And sayd to him, All these will I giue thee, if thou wilt fall downe, and worship me. 
\v 10 Then sayd Iesus vnto him, Auoyde Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him onely shalt thou serue. 
\v 11 Then the deuill left him: and beholde, the Angels came, and ministred vnto him. 
\v 12 And when Iesus had heard that Iohn was committed to prison, he returned into Galile. 
\v 13 And leauing Nazareth, went and dwelt in Capernaum, which is neere the sea in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim, 
\v 14 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the Propet, saying, 
\v 15 The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim by the way of the sea, beyond Iordan, Galile of the Gentiles: 
\v 16 The people which sate in darkenes, sawe great light: and to them which sate in the region, and shadowe of death, light is risen vp. 
\v 17 From that time Iesus began to preach, and to say, Amende your liues: for the kingdome of heauen is at hand. 
\v 18 And Iesus walking by the sea of Galile, sawe two brethren, Simon, which was called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea (for they were fishers.) 
\v 19 And he sayd vnto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men. 
\v 20 And they straightway leauing the nets, folowed him. 
\v 21 And when he was gone forth from thence, he saw other two brethren, Iames the sonne of Zebedeus, and Iohn his brother in a ship with Zebedeus their father, mending their nets, and he called them. 
\v 22 And they without tarying, leauing the ship, and their father, folowed him. 
\v 23 So Iesus went about all Galile, teaching in their Synagogues, and preaching the Gospel of the kingdome, and healing euery sicknesse and euery disease among the people. 
\v 24 And his fame spread abroad through all Syria: and they brought vnto him all sicke people, that were taken with diuers diseases and torments, and them that were possessed with deuils, and those which were lunatike, and those that had the palsey: and he healed them. 
\v 25 And there folowed him great multitudes out of Galile, and Decapolis, and Hierusalem, and Iudea, and from beyond Iordan. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 And when he sawe the multitude, he went vp into a mountaine: and when he was set, his disciples came to him. 
\v 2 And he opened his mouth and taught them, saying, 
\v 3 Blessed are the poore in spirit, for theirs is the kingdome of heauen. 
\v 4 Blessed are they that mourne: for they shall be comforted. 
\v 5 Blessed are the meeke: for they shall inherite the earth. 
\v 6 Blessed are they which hunger and thirst for righteousnes: for they shalbe filled. 
\v 7 Blessed are the mercifull: for they shall obteine mercie. 
\v 8 Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God. 
\v 9 Blessed are the peace makers: for they shall be called the children of God. 
\v 10 Blessed are they which suffer persecution for righteousnes sake: for theirs is the kingdome of heauen. 
\v 11 Blessed shall ye be when men reuile you, and persecute you, and say all maner of euill against you for my sake, falsely. 
\v 12 Reioyce and be glad, for great is your reward in heauen: for so persecuted they the Prophets which were before you. 
\v 13 Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt haue lost his sauour, wherewith shall it be salted? It is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be troden vnder foote of men. 
\v 14 Ye are the light of the world. A citie that is set on an hill, cannot be hid. 
\v 15 Neither doe men light a candel, and put it vnder a bushel, but on a candlesticke, and it giueth light vnto all that are in the house. 
\v 16 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good workes, and glorifie your Father which is in heauen. 
\v 17 Think not that I am come to destroy the Lawe, or the Prophets. I am not come to destroy them, but to fulfill them. 
\v 18 For truely I say vnto you, Till heauen, and earth perish, one iote or one title of the Law shall not scape, till all things be fulfilled. 
\v 19 Whosoeuer therefore shall breake one of these least commandements, and teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdome of heauen: but whosoeuer shall obserue and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdome of heauen. 
\v 20 For I say vnto you, except your righteousnes exceede the righteousnes of the Scribes and Pharises, ye shall not enter into the kingdome of heauen. 
\v 21 Ye haue heard that it was sayd vnto them of the olde time, Thou shalt not kill: for whosoeuer killeth shalbe culpable of iudgement. 
\v 22 But I say vnto you, whosoeuer is angry with his brother vnaduisedly, shalbe culpable of iudgment. And whosoeuer sayth vnto his brother, Raca, shalbe worthy to be punished by the Councill. And whosoeuer shall say, Foole, shalbe worthy to be punished with hell fire. 
\v 23 If then thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there remembrest that thy brother hath ought against thee, 
\v 24 Leaue there thine offring before the altar, and goe thy way: first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift. 
\v 25 Agree with thine aduersarie quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him, lest thine aduersarie deliuer thee to the Iudge, and the Iudge deliuer thee to ye sergeant, and thou be cast into prison. 
\v 26 Verely I say vnto thee, thou shalt not come out thence, till thou hast payed the vtmost farthing. 
\v 27 Ye haue heard that it was sayd to them of olde time, Thou shalt not commit adulterie. 
\v 28 But I say vnto you, that whosoeuer looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath committed adulterie with her already in his heart. 
\v 29 Wherefore if thy right eye cause thee to offend, plucke it out, and cast it from thee: for better it is for thee, that one of thy members perish, then that thy whole body should be cast into hell. 
\v 30 Also if thy right hand make thee to offend, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for better it is for thee that one of thy members perish, then that thy whole body should be cast into hell. 
\v 31 It hath bene sayd also, Whosoeuer shall put away his wife, let him giue her a bill of diuorcement. 
\v 32 But I say vnto you, whosoeuer shall put away his wife (except it be for fornication) causeth her to commit adulterie: and whosoeuer shall marrie her that is diuorced, committeth adulterie. 
\v 33 Againe, ye haue heard that it was sayd to them of old time, Thou shalt not forsweare thy selfe, but shalt performe thine othes to the Lord. 
\v 34 But I say vnto you, Sweare not at all, neither by heauen, for it is the throne of God: 
\v 35 Nor yet by the earth: for it is his footestoole: neither by Hierusalem: for it is the citie of the great King. 
\v 36 Neither shalt thou sweare by thine head, because thou canst not make one heare white or blacke. 
\v 37 But let your communication be Yea, yea: Nay, nay. For whatsoeuer is more then these, commeth of euill. 
\v 38 Ye haue heard that it hath bene sayd, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth. 
\v 39 But I say vnto you, Resist not euill: but whosoeuer shall smite thee on thy right cheeke, turne to him the other also. 
\v 40 And if any man wil sue thee at the law, and take away thy coate, let him haue thy cloke also. 
\v 41 And whosoeuer will compell thee to goe a mile, goe with him twaine. 
\v 42 Giue to him that asketh, and from him that would borowe of thee, turne not away. 
\v 43 Ye haue heard that it hath bin said, Thou shalt loue thy neighbour, and hate your enemie. 
\v 44 But I say vnto you, Loue your enemies: blesse them that curse you: doe good to them that hate you, and pray for them which hurt you, and persecute you, 
\v 45 That ye may be the children of your father that is in heauen: for he maketh his sunne to arise on the euill, and the good, and sendeth raine on the iust, and vniust. 
\v 46 For if ye loue them, which loue you, what rewarde shall you haue? Doe not the Publicanes euen the same? 
\v 47 And if ye be friendly to your brethren onely, what singular thing doe ye? doe not euen the Publicanes likewise? 
\v 48 Ye shall therefore be perfit, as your Father which is in heauen, is perfite. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1 Take heede that ye giue not your almes before men, to be seene of them, or els ye shall haue no reward of your Father which is in heaue. 
\v 2 Therefore when thou giuest thine almes, thou shalt not make a trumpet to be blowen before thee, as the hypocrites doe in the Synagogues and in the streetes, to be praysed of men. Verely I say vnto you, they haue their rewarde. 
\v 3 But when thou doest thine almes, let not thy left hand knowe what thy right hand doeth, 
\v 4 That thine almes may be in secret, and thy Father that seeth in secret, hee will rewarde thee openly. 
\v 5 And when thou prayest, be not as the hypocrites: for they loue to stand, and pray in the Synagogues, and in the corners of the streetes, because they would be seene of men. Verely I say vnto you, they haue their rewarde. 
\v 6 But when thou prayest, enter into thy chamber and when thou hast shut thy doore, pray vnto thy Father which is in secret, and thy Father which seeth in secret, shall rewarde thee openly. 
\v 7 Also when ye pray, vse no vaine repetitions as the Heathen: for they thinke to be heard for their much babbling. 
\v 8 Be ye not like them therefore: for your Father knoweth whereof ye haue neede, before ye aske of him. 
\v 9 After this maner therefore pray ye, Our father which art in heauen, halowed be thy name. 
\v 10 Thy Kingdome come. Thy will be done euen in earth, as it is in heauen. 
\v 11 Giue vs this day our dayly bread. 
\v 12 And forgiue vs our dettes, as we also forgiue our detters. 
\v 13 And leade vs not into tentation, but deliuer vs from euill: for thine is the kingdome, and the power, and the glorie for euer. Amen. 
\v 14 For if ye doe forgiue men their trespasses, your heauenly Father will also forgiue you. 
\v 15 But if ye do not forgiue men their trespasses,, no more will your father forgiue you your trespaces. 
\v 16 Moreouer, when ye fast, looke not sowre as the hypocrites: for they disfigure their faces, that they might seeme vnto men to fast. Verely I say vnto you, that they haue their rewarde. 
\v 17 But when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face, 
\v 18 That thou seeme not vnto men to fast, but vnto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret, will rewarde thee openly. 
\v 19 Lay not vp treasures for your selues vpon the earth, where the mothe and canker corrupt, and where theeues digge through and steale. 
\v 20 But lay vp treasures for your selues in heauen, where neither the mothe nor canker corrupteth, and where theeues neither digge through, nor steale. 
\v 21 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. 
\v 22 The light of the body is the eye: if then thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be light. 
\v 23 But if thine eye be wicked, then all thy body shalbe darke. Wherefore if the light that is in thee, be darkenes, howe great is that darkenesse? 
\v 24 No man can serue two masters: for eyther he shall hate the one, and loue the other, or els he shall leane to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serue God and riches. 
\v 25 Therefore I say vnto you, be not carefull for your life, what ye shall eate, or what ye shall drinke: nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more worth then meate? and the bodie then raiment? 
\v 26 Behold the foules of the heauen: for they sowe not, neither reape, nor carie into the barnes: yet your heauenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better then they? 
\v 27 Which of you by taking care is able to adde one cubite vnto his stature? 
\v 28 And why care ye for raiment? Learne howe the lilies of the fielde doe growe: they are not wearied, neither spinne: 
\v 29 Yet I say vnto you, that euen Salomon in all his glorie was not arayed like one of these. 
\v 30 Wherefore if God so clothe the grasse of the fielde which is to day, and to morowe is cast into the ouen, shall he not doe much more vnto you, O ye of litle faith? 
\v 31 Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eate? or what shall we drinke? or where with shall we be clothed? 
\v 32 (For after all these things seeke the Gentiles) for your heauenly Father knoweth, that ye haue neede of all these things. 
\v 33 But seeke ye first the kingdome of God, and his righteousnesse, and all these things shall be ministred vnto you. 
\v 34 Care not then for the morowe: for the morowe shall care for it selfe: the day hath ynough with his owne griefe. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1 Judge not, that ye be not iudged. 
\v 2 Eor with what iudgement ye iudge, ye shall be iudged, and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you againe. 
\v 3 And why seest thou the mote, that is in thy brothers eye, and perceiuest not the beame that is in thine owne eye? 
\v 4 Or howe sayest thou to thy brother, Suffer me to cast out the mote out of thine eye, and beholde, a beame is in thine owne eye? 
\v 5 Hypocrite, first cast out that beame out of thine owne eye, and then shalt thou see clearely to cast out the mote out of thy brothers eye. 
\v 6 Giue ye not that which is holy, to dogges, neither cast ye your pearles before swine, lest they treade them vnder their feete, and turning againe, all to rent you. 
\v 7 Aske, and it shall be giuen you: seeke, and ye shall finde: knocke, and it shall be opened vnto you. 
\v 8 For whosoeuer asketh, receiueth: and he, that seeketh, findeth: and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened. 
\v 9 For what man is there among you, which if his sonne aske him bread, woulde giue him a stone? 
\v 10 Or if he aske fish, wil he giue him a serpent? 
\v 11 If ye then, which are euill, can giue to your children good giftes, howe much more shall your Father which is in heauen, giue good thinges to them that aske him? 
\v 12 Therefore whatsoeuer ye woulde that men should doe to you, euen so doe ye to them: for this is the Lawe and the Prophets. 
\v 13 Enter in at the streight gate: for it is the wide gate, and broade way that leadeth to destruction: and many there be which goe in thereat, 
\v 14 Because the gate is streight, and the way narowe that leadeth vnto life, and fewe there be that finde it. 
\v 15 Beware of false prophets, which come to you, in sheepes clothing, but inwardly they are rauening wolues. 
\v 16 Ye shall know them by their fruites. Doe men gather grapes of thornes? or figges of thistles? 
\v 17 So euery good tree bringeth foorth good fruite, and a corrupt tree bringeth forth euill fruite. 
\v 18 A good tree can not bring forth euil fruite: neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruite. 
\v 19 Euery tree that bringeth not forth good fruite, is hewen downe, and cast into the fire. 
\v 20 Therefore by their fruites ye shall knowe them. 
\v 21 Not euery one that sayeth vnto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdome of heauen, but he that doeth my Fathers will which is in heauen. 
\v 22 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, haue we not by thy Name prophecied? and by thy name cast out deuils? and by thy name done many great workes? 
\v 23 And then will I professe to them, I neuer knewe you: depart from me, ye that worke iniquitie. 
\v 24 Whosoeuer then heareth of mee these words, and doeth the same, I will liken him to a wise man, which hath builded his house on a rock: 
\v 25 And the raine fell, and the floods came, and the windes blewe, and beat vpon that house, and it fell not: for it was grounded on a rocke. 
\v 26 But whosoeuer heareth these my wordes, and doeth them not, shall be likened vnto a foolish man, which hath builded his house vpon the sand: 
\v 27 And the raine fell, and the floods came, and the windes blewe, and beat vpon that house, and it fell, and the fall thereof was great. 
\v 28 And it came to passe, when Iesus had ended these wordes, the people were astonied at his doctrine. 
\v 29 For he taught them as one hauing authoritie, and not as the Scribes. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1 Nowe when he was come downe from the mountaine, great multitudes followed him. 
\v 2 And loe, there came a Leper and worshipped him, saying, Master, if thou wilt, thou canst make me cleane. 
\v 3 And Iesus putting foorth his hand, touched him, saying, I will, be thou cleane: and immediatly his leprosie was clensed. 
\v 4 Then Iesus saide vnto him, See thou tell no man, but goe, and shewe thy selfe vnto the Priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a witnesse to them. 
\v 5 When Iesus was entred into Capernaum, there came vnto him a Centurion, beseeching him, 
\v 6 And saide, Master, my seruant lieth sicke at home of the palsie, and is grieuously pained. 
\v 7 And Iesus saide vnto him, I will come and heale him. 
\v 8 But the Centurion answered, saying, Master, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come vnder my roofe: but speake the worde onely, and my seruant shall be healed. 
\v 9 For I am a man also vnder the authoritie of an other, and haue souldiers vnder me: and I say to one, Goe, and he goeth: and to another, Come, and he commeth: and to my seruant, Doe this, and he doeth it. 
\v 10 When Iesus heard that, he marueiled, and said to them that folowed him, Verely, I say vnto you, I haue not found so great faith, euen in Israel. 
\v 11 But I say vnto you, that many shall come from the East and West, and shall sit downe with Abraham, and Isaac, and Iacob, in the kingdome of heauen. 
\v 12 And the children of the kingdome shall be cast out into vtter darkenes: there shalbe weeping and gnashing of teeth. 
\v 13 Then Iesus saide vnto the Centurion, Goe thy way, and as thou hast beleeued, so be it vnto thee, And his seruant was healed the same houre. 
\v 14 And when Iesus came to Peters house, he sawe his wiues mother layed downe, and sicke of a feuer. 
\v 15 And he touched her hande, and the feuer left her: so she arose, and ministred vnto them. 
\v 16 When the Euen was come, they brought vnto him many that were possessed with deuils: and he cast out the spirits with his worde, and healed all that were sicke, 
\v 17 That it might be fulfilled, which was spoken by Esaias the Prophet, saying, He tooke our infirmities, and bare our sickenesses. 
\v 18 And when Iesus sawe great multitudes of people about him, he commanded them to goe ouer the water. 
\v 19 Then came there a certaine Scribe, and said vnto him, Master, I will follow thee whithersoeuer thou goest. 
\v 20 But Iesus saide vnto him, The foxes haue holes, and the birdes of the heauen haue nestes, but the Sonne of man hath not whereon to rest his head. 
\v 21 And another of his disciples saide vnto him, Master, suffer me first to goe, and burie my father. 
\v 22 But Iesus said vnto him, Followe me, and let the dead burie their dead. 
\v 23 And when he was entred into ye ship, his disciples followed him. 
\v 24 And beholde, there arose a great tempest in the sea, so that the ship was couered with waues: but he was a sleepe. 
\v 25 Then his disciples came, and awoke him, saying, Master, saue vs: we perish. 
\v 26 And he said vnto them, Why are ye fearefull, O ye of litle faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea: and so there was a great calme. 
\v 27 And the men marueiled, saying, What man is this, that both the windes and the sea obey him! 
\v 28 And when he was come to the other side into ye countrey of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with deuils, which came out of the graues very fierce, so that no man might goe by that way. 
\v 29 And beholde, they cryed out, saying, Iesus the sonne of God, what haue we to do with thee? Art thou come hither to tormet vs before ye time? 
\v 30 Nowe there was, afarre off from them, a great heard of swine feeding. 
\v 31 And the deuils besought him, saying, If thou cast vs out, suffer vs to goe into the heard of swine. 
\v 32 And he said vnto them, Go. So they went out and departed into the heard of swine: and beholde, the whole heard of swine ranne headlong into the sea, and died in the water. 
\v 33 Then the heardmen fled: and when they were come into the citie, they tolde all things, and what was become of them that were possessed with the deuils. 
\v 34 And beholde, all ye citie came out to meete Iesus: and when they sawe him, they besought him to depart out of their coastes. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 Then hee entred into a shippe, and passed ouer, and came into his owne citie. 
\v 2 And loe, they brought to him a man sicke of the palsie, laid on a bed. And Iesus seeing their faith, saide to the sicke of the palsie, Sonne, be of good comfort: thy sinnes are forgiuen thee. 
\v 3 And beholde, certaine of the Scribes saide with themselues, This man blasphemeth. 
\v 4 But when Iesus saw their thoughts, he said, Wherefore thinke yee euil things in your hearts? 
\v 5 For whether is it easier to say, Thy sinnes are forgiuen thee, or to say, Arise, and walke? 
\v 6 And that ye may knowe that the Sonne of man hath authoritie in earth to forgiue sinnes, (then saide he vnto the sicke of the palsie,) Arise, take vp thy bed, and goe to thine house. 
\v 7 And hee arose, and departed to his owne house. 
\v 8 So when the multitude sawe it, they marueiled, and glorified God, which had giuen such authoritie to men. 
\v 9 And as Iesus passed foorth from thence, hee sawe a man sitting at the custome, named Matthewe, and saide to him, Followe me. And he arose, and followed him. 
\v 10 And it came to passe, as Iesus sate at meate in his house, beholde, many Publicanes and sinners, that came thither, sate downe at the table with Iesus and his disciples. 
\v 11 And when the Pharises sawe that, they saide to his disciples, Why eateth your master with Publicanes and sinners? 
\v 12 Nowe when Iesus heard it, hee sayde vnto them, The whole neede not a Physition, but they that are sicke. 
\v 13 But goe yee and learne what this is, I will haue mercie, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but the sinners to repentance. 
\v 14 Then came the disciples of Iohn to him, saying, Why doe we and the Pharises fast oft, and thy disciples fast not? 
\v 15 And Iesus saide vnto them, Can the children of the marriage chamber mourne as long as the bridegrome is with them? But the daies will come, when the bridegrome shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast. 
\v 16 Moreouer no man pieceth an olde garment with a piece of newe cloth: for that that should fill it vp, taketh away from the garment, and the breach is worse. 
\v 17 Neither doe they put newe wine into olde vessels: for then the vessels would breake, and the wine woulde be spilt, and the vessels shoulde perish: but they put new wine into newe vessels, and so are both preserued. 
\v 18 While hee thus spake vnto them, beholde, there came a certaine ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is nowe deceased, but come and laie thine hande on her, and shee shall liue. 
\v 19 And Iesus arose and followed him with his disciples. 
\v 20 (And beholde, a woman which was diseased with an issue of blood twelue yeres, came behinde him, and touched the hemme of his garment. 
\v 21 For shee saide in her selfe, If I may touche but his garment onely, I shalbe whole. 
\v 22 Then Iesus turned him about, and seeing her, did say, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole at that same moment.) 
\v 23 Nowe when Iesus came into the Rulers house, and saw the minstrels and the multitude making noise, 
\v 24 He said vnto them, Get you hence: for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorne. 
\v 25 And when the multitude were put foorth, hee went in and tooke her by the hande, and the maide arose. 
\v 26 And this bruite went throughout all that lande. 
\v 27 And as Iesus departed thence, two blinde men followed him, crying, and saying, O sonne of Dauid, haue mercie vpon vs. 
\v 28 And when hee was come into the house, the blinde came to him, and Iesus saide vnto them, Beleeue yee that I am able to doe this? And they sayd vnto him, Yea, Lord. 
\v 29 Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it vnto you. 
\v 30 And their eyes were opened, and Iesus gaue them great charge, saying, See that no man knowe it. 
\v 31 But when they were departed, they spread abroad his fame throughout all that land. 
\v 32 And as they went out, beholde, they brought to him a domme man possessed with a deuill. 
\v 33 And when the deuill was cast out, the domme spake: then the multitude marueiled, saying, The like was neuer seene in Israel. 
\v 34 But the Pharises saide, He casteth out deuils, through the prince of deuils. 
\v 35 And Iesus went about all cities and townes, teaching in their Synagogues, and preaching the Gospel of the kingdome, and healing euery sickenesse and euery disease among the people. 
\v 36 But when he saw the multitude, he had compassion vpon them, because they were dispersed, and scattered abroade, as sheepe hauing no shepheard. 
\v 37 Then saide he to his disciples, Surely the haruest is great, but the labourers are fewe. 
\v 38 Wherefore pray the Lord of the haruest, that he woulde sende foorth labourers into his haruest. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1 And hee called his twelue disciples vnto him, and gaue them power against vncleane spirits, to cast them out, and to heale euery sickenesse, and euery disease. 
\v 2 Nowe the names of the twelue Apostles are these. The first is Simon, called Peter, and Andrew his brother: Iames the sonne of Zebedeus, and Iohn his brother. 
\v 3 Philippe and Bartlemewe: Thomas, and Matthewe that Publicane: Iames the sonne of Alpheus, and Lebbeus whose surname was Thaddeus: 
\v 4 Simon the Cananite, and Iudas Iscariot, who also betraied him. 
\v 5 These twelue did Iesus send forth, and commanded them, saying, Goe not into the way of of the Gentiles, and into the cities of the Samaritans enter yee not: 
\v 6 But goe rather to the lost sheepe of the house of Israel. 
\v 7 And as ye goe, preach, saying, The kingdome of heauen is at hand. 
\v 8 Heale the sicke: cleanse the lepers: raise vp the dead: cast out the deuils. Freely ye haue receiued, freely giue. 
\v 9 Possesse not golde, nor siluer, nor money in your girdels, 
\v 10 Nor a scrippe for the iourney, neither two coates, neither shoes, nor a staffe: for the workeman is worthie of his meate. 
\v 11 And into whatsoeuer citie or towne ye shall come, enquire who is worthy in it, and there abide till yee goe thence. 
\v 12 And when yee come into an house, salute the same. 
\v 13 And if the house be worthy, let your peace come vpon it: but if it be not worthie, let your peace returne to you. 
\v 14 And whosoeuer shall not receiue you, nor heare your woordes, when yee depart out of that house, or that citie, shake off the dust of your feete. 
\v 15 Truely I say vnto you, it shall be easier for them of the lande of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of iudgement, then for that citie. 
\v 16 Behold, I send you as sheepe in the middes of the wolues: be yee therefore wise as serpents, and innocent as doues. 
\v 17 But beware of men, for they will deliuer you vp to the Councils, and will scourge you in their Synagogues. 
\v 18 And ye shall be brought to the gouernours and Kings for my sake, in witnes to them, and to the Gentiles. 
\v 19 But when they deliuer you vp, take no thought howe or what ye shall speake: for it shall be giuen you in that houre, what ye shall say. 
\v 20 For it is not yee that speake, but the spirite of your father which speaketh in you. 
\v 21 And the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the sonne, and the children shall rise against their parents, and shall cause them to die. 
\v 22 And yee shall be hated of all men for my Name: but he that endureth to the end, he shall be saued. 
\v 23 And when they persecute you in this citie, flee into another: for verely I say vnto you, yee shall not goe ouer all the cities of Israel, till the Sonne of man be come. 
\v 24 The disciple is not aboue his master, nor the seruant aboue his Lord. 
\v 25 It is ynough for the disciple to bee as his master is, and the seruaunt as his Lord. If they haue called the master of the house Beel-zebub, howe much more them of his housholde? 
\v 26 Feare them not therefore: for there is nothing couered, that shall not be disclosed, nor hid, that shall not be knowen. 
\v 27 What I tell you in darkenesse, that speake yee in light: and what yee heare in the eare, that preach yee on the houses. 
\v 28 And feare yee not them which kill the bodie, but are nor able to kill the soule: but rather feare him, which is able to destroy both soule and bodie in hell. 
\v 29 Are not two sparrowes sold for a farthing, and one of them shall not fal on the ground without your Father? 
\v 30 Yea, and all the heares of your head are nombred. 
\v 31 Feare ye not therefore, yee are of more value then many sparowes. 
\v 32 Whosoeuer therefore shall confesse me before men, him will I confesse also before my Father which is in heauen. 
\v 33 But whosoeuer shall denie me before me, him will I also denie before my Father which is in heauen. 
\v 34 Thinke not that I am come to sende peace into the earth: I came not to send peace, but the sworde. 
\v 35 For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in lawe. 
\v 36 And a mans enemies shall be they of his owne housholde. 
\v 37 He that loueth father or mother more then me, is not worthie of me. And he that loueth sonne, or daughter more then mee, is not worthie of me. 
\v 38 And hee that taketh not his crosse, and followeth after me, is not worthie of me. 
\v 39 He that will finde his life, shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake, shall finde it. 
\v 40 He that receiueth you, receiueth me: and hee that receiueth mee, receiueth him that hath sent me. 
\v 41 Hee that receiueth a Prophet in the name of a Prophet, shall receiue a Prophetes rewarde: and hee that receiueth a righteous man, in the name of a righteous man, shall receiue the rewarde of a righteous man. 
\v 42 And whosoeuer shall giue vnto one of these litle ones to drinke a cuppe of colde water onely, in the name of a disciple, verely I say vnto you, he shall not lose his rewarde. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 And it came to passe that when Iesus had made an ende of commaunding his twelue disciples, hee departed thence to teache and to preach in their cities. 
\v 2 And when Iohn heard in the prison the woorkes of Christ, he sent two of his disciples, and sayde vnto him, 
\v 3 Art thou he that shoulde come, or shall we looke for another? 
\v 4 And Iesus answering, said vnto them, Goe, and shewe Iohn, what things ye heare, and see. 
\v 5 The blinde receiue sight, and the halt doe walke: the lepers are clensed, and the deafe heare, the dead are raised vp, and the poore receiue the Gospel. 
\v 6 And blessed is he that shall not be offeded in me. 
\v 7 And as they departed, Iesus beganne to speake vnto the multitude, of Iohn, What went ye out into the wildernes to see? A reede shaken with the winde? 
\v 8 But what went ye out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they that weare soft clothing, are in Kings houses. 
\v 9 But what went ye out to see? A Prophet? Yea, I say vnto you, and more then a Prophet. 
\v 10 For this is he of whom it is written, Beholde, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. 
\v 11 Verely I say vnto you, among them which are begotten of women, arose there not a greater then Iohn Baptist: notwithstanding, he that is the least in the kingdome of heauen, is greater then he. 
\v 12 And from the time of Iohn Baptist hitherto, the kingdome of heauen suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force. 
\v 13 For all the Prophetes and the Lawe prophecied vnto Iohn. 
\v 14 And if ye will receiue it, this is that Elias, which was to come. 
\v 15 He that hath eares to heare, let him heare. 
\v 16 But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like vnto litle children which sit in the markets, and call vnto their fellowes, 
\v 17 And say, We haue piped vnto you, and ye haue not daunced, we haue mourned vnto you, and ye haue not lamented. 
\v 18 For Iohn came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a deuill. 
\v 19 The sonne of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Beholde a glutton and a drinker of wine, a friend vnto Publicanes and sinners: but wisedome is iustified of her children. 
\v 20 Then began he to vpbraide the cities, wherein most of his great workes were done, because they repented not. 
\v 21 Woe be to thee, Chorazin: Woe be to thee, Bethsaida: for if ye great workes, which were done in you, had bene done in Tyrus and Sidon, they had repented long agone in sackecloth and ashes. 
\v 22 But I say to you, It shalbe easier for Tyrus and Sidon at the day of iudgement, then for you. 
\v 23 And thou, Capernaum, which art lifted vp vnto heauen, shalt be brought downe to hell: for if the great workes, which haue bin done in thee, had bene done among them of Sodom, they had remained to this day. 
\v 24 But I say vnto you, that it shall be easier for them of the land of Sodom in the day of iudgement, then for thee. 
\v 25 At that time Iesus answered, and saide, I giue thee thankes, O Father, Lord of heauen and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and men of vnderstanding, and hast opened them vnto babes. 
\v 26 It is so, O Father, because thy good pleasure was such. 
\v 27 All things are giuen vnto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Sonne, but ye Father: neither knoweth any man ye Father, but the Sonne, and he to whom ye Sonne will reueile him. 
\v 28 Come vnto me, all ye that are wearie and laden, and I will ease you. 
\v 29 Take my yoke on you, and learne of me that I am meeke and lowly in heart: and ye shall finde rest vnto your soules. 
\v 30 For my yoke is easie, and my burden light. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 At that time Iesus went on a Sabbath day through ye corne, and his disciples were an hungred, and bega to plucke ye eares of corne and to eate. 
\v 2 And when the Pharises sawe it, they saide vnto him, Beholde, thy disciples doe that which is not lawfull to doe vpon the Sabbath. 
\v 3 But he said vnto them, Haue ye not read what Dauid did when he was an hungred, and they that were with him? 
\v 4 Howe he entred into ye house of God, and did eate the shewe bread, which was not lawfull for him to eate, neither for them which were with him, but onely for the Priestes? 
\v 5 Or haue ye not read in the Lawe, how that on the Sabbath dayes the Priestes in the Temple breake the Sabbath, and are blameles? 
\v 6 But I say vnto you, that here is one greater then the Temple. 
\v 7 Wherefore if ye knewe what this is, I will haue mercie, and not sacrifice, ye would not haue condemned the innocents. 
\v 8 For the sonne of man is Lord, euen of the Sabbath. 
\v 9 And he departed thence, and went into their Synagogue: 
\v 10 And beholde, there was a man which had his hand dried vp. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawfull to heale vpon a Sabbath day? that they might accuse him. 
\v 11 And he said vnto the, What man shall there be among you, that hath a sheepe, and if it fal on a Sabbath day into a pit, doth not take it and lift it out? 
\v 12 How much more then is a man better then a sheepe? therefore, it is lawfull to doe well on a Sabbath day. 
\v 13 Then said he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it foorth, and it was made whole as the other. 
\v 14 Then the Pharises went out, and consulted against him, howe they might destroy him. 
\v 15 But whe Iesus knew it, he departed thece, and great multitudes folowed him, and he healed the al, 
\v 16 And charged them in threatning wise, that they should not make him knowen, 
\v 17 That it might be fulfilled, which was spoken by Esaias the Prophet, saying, 
\v 18 Behold my seruant whom I haue chosen, my beloued in whom my soule deliteth: I wil put my Spirit on him, and he shall shewe iudgement to the Gentiles. 
\v 19 He shall not striue, nor crie, neither shall any man heare his voyce in the streetes. 
\v 20 A bruised reede shall he not breake, and smoking flaxe shall he not quenche, till he bring forth iudgement vnto victorie. 
\v 21 And in his Name shall the Gentiles trust. 
\v 22 Then was brought to him one, possessed with a deuill, both blind, and dumme, and he healed him, so that he which was blind and dumme, both spake and saw. 
\v 23 And all the people were amased, and saide, Is not this that sonne of Dauid? 
\v 24 But when the Pharises heard it, they saide, This man casteth the deuils no otherwise out, but through Beelzebub the prince of deuils. 
\v 25 But Iesus knew their thoughtes, and said to them, Euery kingdome deuided against it selfe, is brought to nought: and euery citie or house, deuided against it selfe, shall not stand. 
\v 26 So if Satan cast out Satan, he is deuided against himself: how shall then his kingdom endure? 
\v 27 Also if I through Beelzebub cast out deuils, by whom doe your children cast them out? Therefore they shall be your iudges. 
\v 28 But if I cast out deuils by ye Spirit of God, then is the kingdome of God come vnto you. 
\v 29 Els howe can a man enter into a strong mans house and spoyle his goods, except he first bind the strong man, and then spoile his house. 
\v 30 He that is not with me, is against me: and he that gathereth not with me, scattereth. 
\v 31 Wherefore I say vnto you, euery sinne and blasphemie shalbe forgiuen vnto men: but the blasphemie against the holy Ghost shall not be forgiuen vnto men. 
\v 32 And whosoeuer shall speake a word against the Sonne of man, it shall be forgiuen him: but whosoeuer shall speake against the holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiuen him, neither in this worlde, nor in the worlde to come. 
\v 33 Either make the tree good, and his fruite good: or els make the tree euill, and his fruite euil: for the tree is knowen by the fruite. 
\v 34 O generations of vipers, howe can you speake good things, when ye are euill? For of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. 
\v 35 A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth foorth good things: and an euill man out of an euill treasure, bringeth forth euill things. 
\v 36 But I say vnto you, that of euery idle word that men shall speake, they shall giue account thereof at the day of iudgement. 
\v 37 For by thy wordes thou shalt be iustified, and by thy wordes thou shalt be condemned. 
\v 38 Then answered certaine of ye Scribes and of the Pharises, saying, Master, we would see a signe of thee. 
\v 39 But he answered and said to them, An euill and adulterous generation seeketh a signe, but no signe shall be giuen vnto it, saue that signe of the Prophet Ionas. 
\v 40 For as Ionas was three daies and three nights in the whales belly: so shall the Sonne of man be three daies and three nights in ye heart of the earth. 
\v 41 The men of Nineue shall rise in iudgement with this generation, and condemne it: for they repented at the preaching of Ionas: and behold, a greater then Ionas is here. 
\v 42 The Queene of the South shall rise in iudgement with this generation, and shall condemne it: for she came from the vtmost partes of the earth to heare the wisdome of Salomon: and beholde, a greater then Salomon is here. 
\v 43 Nowe when the vncleane spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh throughout drie places, seeking rest, and findeth none. 
\v 44 Then he saith, I wil returne into mine house from whence I came: and when he is come, he findeth it emptie, swept and garnished. 
\v 45 Then he goeth, and taketh vnto him seuen other spirites worse then himselfe, and they enter in, and dwell there: and the ende of that man is worse then the beginning. Euen so shall it be with this wicked generation. 
\v 46 While he yet spake to ye multitude, beholde, his mother, and his brethren stood without, desiring to speake with him. 
\v 47 Then one said vnto him, Beholde, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speake with thee. 
\v 48 But he answered, and said to him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren? 
\v 49 And he stretched foorth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Beholde my mother and my brethren. 
\v 50 For whosoeuer shall doe my Fathers will which is in heauen, the same is my brother and sister and mother. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 The same day went Iesus out of the house, and sate by the sea side. 
\v 2 And great multitudes resorted vnto him, so that he went into a ship, and sate downe: and the whole multitude stoode on the shore. 
\v 3 Then he spake many things to them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sowe. 
\v 4 And as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the foules came and deuoured them vp. 
\v 5 And some fell vpon stony grounde, where they had not much earth, and anon they sprong vp, because they had no depth of earth. 
\v 6 And when the sunne was vp, they were parched, and for lacke of rooting, withered away. 
\v 7 And some fell among thornes, and the thornes sprong vp, and choked them. 
\v 8 Some againe fel in good ground, and brought forth fruite, one corne an hundreth folde, some sixtie folde, and another thirtie folde. 
\v 9 He that hath eares to heare, let him heare. 
\v 10 Then the disciples came, and said to him, Why speakest thou to them in parables? 
\v 11 And he answered, and said vnto them, Because it is giuen vnto you, to know the secretes of the kingdome of heauen, but to the it is not giue. 
\v 12 For whosoeuer hath, to him shalbe giuen, and he shall haue abundance: but whosoeuer hath not, from him shalbe taken away, euen that he hath. 
\v 13 Therefore speake I to them in parables, because they seeing, doe not see: and hearing, they heare not, neither vnderstand. 
\v 14 So in them is fulfilled the prophecie of Esaias, which prophecie saieth, By hearing, ye shall heare, and shall not vnderstand, and seeing, ye shall see, and shall not perceiue. 
\v 15 For this peoples heart is waxed fat, and their eares are dull of hearing, and with their eyes they haue winked, lest they should see with their eyes, and heare with their eares, and should vnderstand with their hearts, and should returne, that I might heale them. 
\v 16 But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your eares, for they heare. 
\v 17 For verely I say vnto you, that many Prophets, and righteous men haue desired to see those things which ye see, and haue not seene them, and to heare those things which ye heare, and haue not heard them. 
\v 18 Heare ye therefore ye parable of ye sower. 
\v 19 Whensoeuer any man heareth the woorde of that kingdome, and vnderstandeth it not, that euil one commeth, and catcheth away that which was sowen in his heart: and this is he which hath receiued the seede by the way side. 
\v 20 And hee that receiued seede in the stonie grounde, is he which heareth the woorde, and incontinently with ioy receiueth it, 
\v 21 Yet hath he no roote in himselfe, and dureth but a season: for assoone as tribulation or persecution commeth because of the woorde, by and by he is offended. 
\v 22 And hee that receiued the seede among thornes, is hee that heareth the woorde: but the care of this worlde, and the deceitfulnesse of riches choke the word, and he is made vnfruitfull. 
\v 23 But he that receiued the seede in the good ground, is he that heareth the worde, and vnderstandeth it, which also beareth fruite, and bringeth foorth, some an hundreth folde, some sixtie folde, and some thirtie folde. 
\v 24 Another parable put hee foorth vnto them, saying, The kingdome of heauen is like vnto a man which sowed good seede in his fielde. 
\v 25 But while men slept, there came his enemie, and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his waie. 
\v 26 And when the blade was sprong vp, and brought forth fruite, then appeared the tares also. 
\v 27 Then came the seruaunts of the housholder, and sayd vnto him, Master, sowedst not thou good seede in thy fielde? from whence then hath it tares? 
\v 28 And hee said to them, Some enuious man hath done this. Then the seruants saide vnto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them vp? 
\v 29 But he saide, Nay, lest while yee goe about to gather the tares, yee plucke vp also with them the wheat. 
\v 30 Let both growe together vntill the haruest, and in time of haruest I will say to the reapers, Gather yee first the tares, and binde them in sheaues to burne them: but gather the wheate into my barne. 
\v 31 Another parable he put foorth vnto them, saying, The kingdome of heauen is like vnto a graine of mustard seede, which a man taketh and soweth in his fielde: 
\v 32 Which in deede is the least of all seedes: but when it is growen, it is the greatest among herbes, and it is a tree, so that the birdes of heauen come and builde in the branches thereof. 
\v 33 Another parable spake hee to them, The kingdome of heauen is like vnto leauen, which a woman taketh and hideth in three pecks of meale, till all be leauened. 
\v 34 All these thinges spake Iesus vnto the multitude in parables, and without parables spake he not to them, 
\v 35 That it might be fulfilled, which was spoken by the Prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables, and will vtter the thinges which haue beene kept secrete from the foundation of the worlde. 
\v 36 Then sent Iesus the multitude away, and went into the house. And his disciples came vnto him, saying, Declare vnto vs the parable of the tares of that fielde. 
\v 37 Then answered he, and saide to them, He that soweth the good seede, is the Sonne of man. 
\v 38 And the field is the worlde, and the good seede are the children of the kingdome, and the tares are the children of that wicked one. 
\v 39 And the enemie that soweth them, is the deuill, and the haruest is the end of the worlde, and the reapers be the Angels. 
\v 40 As then the tares are gathered and burned in ye fire, so shall it be in the end of this world. 
\v 41 The Sonne of man shall send forth his Angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which doe iniquitie, 
\v 42 And shall cast them into a fornace of fire. There shalbe wailing and gnashing of teeth. 
\v 43 Then shall the iust men shine as ye sunne in the kingdome of their Father. Hee that hath eares to heare, let him heare. 
\v 44 Againe, the kingdom of heauen is like vnto a treasure hid in ye field, which when a man hath found, he hideth it, and for ioy thereof departeth and selleth all that he hath, and buieth that field. 
\v 45 Againe, the kingdome of heauen is like to a marchant man, that seeketh good pearles, 
\v 46 Who hauing found a pearle of great price, went and solde all that he had, and bought it. 
\v 47 Againe, the kingdom of heauen is like vnto a drawe net cast into the sea, that gathereth of all kindes of things. 
\v 48 Which, when it is full, men draw to lande, and sit and gather the good into vessels, and cast the bad away. 
\v 49 So shall it be at the end of the world. The Angels shall goe foorth, and seuer the bad from among the iust, 
\v 50 And shall cast them into a fornace of fire: there shalbe wailing, and gnashing of teeth. 
\v 51 Iesus saide vnto them, Vnderstand yee all these things? They saide vnto him, Yea, Lord. 
\v 52 Then sayd hee vnto them, Therefore euery Scribe which is taught vnto the kingdome of heauen, is like vnto an householder, which bringeth foorth out of his treasure things both newe and olde. 
\v 53 And it came to passe, that when Iesus had ended these parables, he departed thence, 
\v 54 And came into his owne countrey, and taught them in their Synagogue, so that they were astonied, and saide, Whence commeth this wisdome and great woorkes vnto this man? 
\v 55 Is not this the carpenters sonne? Is not his mother called Marie, and his brethren Iames and Ioses, and Simon and Iudas? 
\v 56 And are not his sisters all with vs? Whence then hath he all these things? 
\v 57 And they were offended with him. Then Iesus said to them, A Prophet is not without honour, saue in his owne countrey, and in his owne house. 
\v 58 And he did not many great woorkes there, for their vnbeliefes sake. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1 At that time Herod the Tetrarche heard of the fame of Iesus, 
\v 2 And sayde vnto his seruaunts, This is that Iohn Baptist, hee is risen againe from the deade, and therefore great woorkes are wrought by him. 
\v 3 For Herod had taken Iohn, and bounde him, and put him in prison for Herodias sake, his brother Philips wife. 
\v 4 For Iohn saide vnto him, It is not lawfull for thee to haue her. 
\v 5 And when hee woulde haue put him to death, hee feared the multitude, because they counted him as a Prophet. 
\v 6 But when Herods birth day was kept, the daughter of Herodias daunced before them, and pleased Herod. 
\v 7 Wherefore he promised with an othe, that he would giue her whatsoeuer she would aske. 
\v 8 And shee being before instructed of her mother, sayde, Giue mee here Iohn Baptists head in a platter. 
\v 9 And the King was sorie: neuerthelesse because of the othe, and them that sate with him at the table, he commanded it to be giuen her, 
\v 10 And sent, and beheaded Iohn in the prison. 
\v 11 And his head was brought in a platter, and giuen to the maide, and shee brought it vnto her mother. 
\v 12 And his disciples came, and tooke vp the bodie, and buried it, and went, and tolde Iesus. 
\v 13 And when Iesus heard it, hee departed thence by shippe into a desert place apart. And when the multitude had heard it, they followed him on foote out of the cities. 
\v 14 And Iesus went foorth and sawe a great multitude, and was mooued with compassion toward them, and he healed their sicke. 
\v 15 And when euen was come, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desart place, and the time is alreadie past: let the multitude depart, that they may goe into the townes, and bye them vitailes. 
\v 16 But Iesus saide to them, They haue no neede to goe away: giue yee them to eate. 
\v 17 Then saide they vnto him, Wee haue here but fiue loaues, and two fishes. 
\v 18 And he saide, Bring them hither to me. 
\v 19 And hee commanded the multitude to sit downe on the grasse, and tooke the fiue loaues and the two fishes, and looked vp to heauen and blessed, and brake, and gaue the loaues to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude. 
\v 20 And they did all eate, and were sufficed, and they tooke vp of the fragments that remained, twelue baskets full. 
\v 21 And they that had eaten, were about fiue thousande men, beside women and litle children. 
\v 22 And straightway Iesus compelled his disciples to enter into a shippe, and to goe ouer before him, while he sent the multitude away. 
\v 23 And assoone as hee had sent the multitude away, he went vp into a moutaine alone to pray: and when the euening was come, hee was there alone. 
\v 24 And the shippe was nowe in the middes of the sea, and was tossed with waues: for it was a contrarie winde. 
\v 25 And in the fourth watch of the night, Iesus went vnto them, walking on the sea. 
\v 26 And when his disciples sawe him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit, and cried out for feare. 
\v 27 But straight way Iesus spake vnto them, saying, Be of good comfort, It is I: be not afraide. 
\v 28 Then Peter answered him, and saide, Master, if it be thou, bid me come vnto thee on the water. 
\v 29 And he saide, Come. And when Peter was come downe out of the shippe, he walked on the water, to goe to Iesus. 
\v 30 But when he sawe a mightie winde, he was afraide: and as he began to sinke, he cried, saying, Master, saue me. 
\v 31 So immediatly Iesus stretched foorth his hande, and caught him, and saide to him, O thou of litle faith, wherefore diddest thou doubt? 
\v 32 And assoone as they were come into the ship, the winde ceased. 
\v 33 Then they that were in the ship, came and worshipped him, saying, Of a trueth thou art the Sonne of God. 
\v 34 And when they were come ouer, they came into the land of Gennezaret. 
\v 35 And when the men of that place knewe him, they sent out into all that countrey rounde about, and brought vnto him all that were sicke, 
\v 36 And besought him, that they might touch the hemme of his garment onely: and as many as touched it, were made whole. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1 Then came to Iesus the Scribes and Pharises, which were of Hierusalem, saying, 
\v 2 Why do thy disciples transgresse the tradition of the Elders? for they wash not their hands when they eate bread. 
\v 3 But he answered and said vnto them, Why doe yee also transgresse the commandement of God by your tradition? 
\v 4 For God hath commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and he that curseth father or mother, let him die the death. 
\v 5 But ye say, Whosoeuer shall say to father or mother, By the gift that is offered by me, thou maiest haue profite, 
\v 6 Though hee honour not his father, or his mother, shalbe free: thus haue ye made the commandement of God of no aucthoritie by your tradition. 
\v 7 O hypocrites, Esaias prophecied well of you, saying, 
\v 8 This people draweth neere vnto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with the lips, but their heart is farre off from me. 
\v 9 But in vaine they worship me, teaching for doctrines, mens precepts. 
\v 10 Then hee called the multitude vnto him, and said to them, Heare and vnderstand. 
\v 11 That which goeth into the mouth, defileth not the man, but that which commeth out of the mouth, that defileth the man. 
\v 12 Then came his disciples, and saide vnto him, Perceiuest thou not, that the Pharises are offended in hearing this saying? 
\v 13 But hee answered and saide, Euery plant which mine heauenly Father hath not planted, shalbe rooted vp. 
\v 14 Let them alone, they be the blinde leaders of the blinde: and if the blinde leade ye blinde, both shall fall into the ditche. 
\v 15 Then answered Peter, and said to him, Declare vnto vs this parable. 
\v 16 Then said Iesus, Are ye yet without vnderstanding? 
\v 17 Perceiue ye not yet, that whatsoeuer entreth into the mouth, goeth into the bellie, and is cast out into the draught? 
\v 18 But those thinges which proceede out of the mouth, come from the heart, and they defile the man. 
\v 19 For out of the heart come euil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false testimonies, slaunders. 
\v 20 These are the things, which defile the man: but to eat with vnwashen hands, defileth not ye man. 
\v 21 And Iesus went thence, and departed into the coastes of Tyrus and Sidon. 
\v 22 And beholde, a woman a Cananite came out of the same coasts, and cried, saying vnto him, Haue mercie on me, O Lord, the sonne of Dauid: my daughter is miserably vexed with a deuil. 
\v 23 But hee answered her not a worde. Then came to him his disciples, and besought him, saying, Sende her away, for she crieth after vs. 
\v 24 But he answered, and said, I am not sent, but vnto the lost sheepe of the house of Israel. 
\v 25 Yet she came, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, helpe me. 
\v 26 And he answered, and said, It is not good to take the childrens bread, and to cast it to whelps. 
\v 27 But she said, Trueth, Lord: yet in deede the whelpes eate of the crommes, which fall from their masters table. 
\v 28 Then Iesus answered, and saide vnto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it to thee, as thou desirest. And her daughter was made whole at that houre. 
\v 29 So Iesus went away from thence, and came neere vnto the sea of Galile, and went vp into a mountaine and sate downe there. 
\v 30 And great multitudes came vnto him, hauing with them, halt, blinde, dumme, maymed, and many other, and cast them downe at Iesus feete, and he healed them. 
\v 31 In so much that the multitude wondered, to see the dumme speake, the maimed whole, the halt to goe, and the blinde to see: and they glorified the God of Israel. 
\v 32 Then Iesus called his disciples vnto him, and said, I haue compassion on this multitude, because they haue continued with mee already three dayes, and haue nothing to eate: and I wil not let them depart fasting, least they faint in the way. 
\v 33 And his disciples saide vnto him, Whence should we get so much bread in the wildernes, as should suffice so great a multitude! 
\v 34 And Iesus said vnto them, How many loaues haue ye? And they said, Seuen, and a few litle fishes. 
\v 35 Then he commanded the multitude to sit downe on the ground, 
\v 36 And tooke the seuen loaues, and the fishes, and gaue thankes, and brake them, and gaue to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude. 
\v 37 And they did all eate, and were sufficed: and they tooke vp of the fragments that remained, seuen baskets full. 
\v 38 And they that had eaten, were foure thousand men, beside women, and litle children. 
\v 39 Then Iesus sent away the multitude, and tooke ship, and came into the partes of Magdala. 
\c 16  
\p
\v 1 Then came the Pharises and Sadduces, and did tempt him, desiring him to shew them a signe from heauen. 
\v 2 But he answered, and said vnto them, When it is euening, ye say, Faire wether: for ye skie is red. 
\v 3 And in the morning ye say, To day shall be a tempest: for the skie is red and lowring. O hypocrites, ye can discerne the face of the skie, and can ye not discerne the signes of the times? 
\v 4 The wicked generation, and adulterous seeketh a signe, but there shall no signe be giuen it, but that signe of the Prophet Ionas: so hee left them, and departed. 
\v 5 And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread with them. 
\v 6 Then Iesus said vnto them, Take heede and beware of the leauen of the Pharises and Sadduces. 
\v 7 And they reasoned among themselues, saying, It is because we haue brought no bread. 
\v 8 But Iesus knowing it, saide vnto them, O ye of litle faith, why reason you thus among your selues, because ye haue brought no bread? 
\v 9 Doe ye not yet perceiue, neither remember the fiue loaues, when there were fiue thousand men, and how many baskets tooke ye vp? 
\v 10 Neither the seuen loaues when there were foure thousande men, and howe many baskets tooke ye vp? 
\v 11 Why perceiue ye not that I said not vnto you concerning bread, that ye shoulde beware of the leauen of the Pharises and Sadduces? 
\v 12 Then vnderstood they that he had not said that they should beware of the leauen of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharises, and Sadduces. 
\v 13 Nowe when Iesus came into the coastes of Cesarea Philippi, hee asked his disciples, saying, Whome doe men say that I, the sonne of man am? 
\v 14 And they said, Some say, Iohn Baptist: and some, Elias: and others, Ieremias, or one of the Prophets. 
\v 15 He said vnto them, But whome say ye that I am? 
\v 16 Then Simon Peter answered, and said, Thou art that Christ, the Sonne of the liuing God. 
\v 17 And Iesus answered, and saide to him, Blessed art thou, Simon, the sonne of Ionas: for flesh and blood hath not reueiled it vnto thee, but my Father which is in heauen. 
\v 18 And I say also vnto thee, that thou art Peter, and vpon this rocke I will builde my Church: and ye gates of hell shall not ouercome it. 
\v 19 And I will giue vnto thee the keyes of the kingdome of heauen, and whatsoeuer thou shalt binde vpon earth, shalbe bound in heauen: and whatsoeuer thou shalt loose on earth, shall be loosed in heauen. 
\v 20 Then hee charged his disciples, that they should tell no man that he was Iesus that Christ. 
\v 21 From that time foorth Iesus beganne to shewe vnto his disciples, that he must goe vnto Hierusalem, and suffer many thinges of the Elders, and of the hie Priestes, and Scribes, and be slaine, and be raised againe the thirde day. 
\v 22 Then Peter tooke him aside, and began to rebuke him, saying, Master, pitie thy selfe: this shall not be vnto thee. 
\v 23 Then he turned backe, and said vnto Peter, Get thee behinde me, Satan: thou art an offence vnto me, because thou vnderstandest not the thinges that are of God, but the thinges that are of men. 
\v 24 Iesus then saide to his disciples, If any man will follow me, let him forsake himselfe: and take vp his crosse, and follow me. 
\v 25 For whosoeuer will saue his life, shall lose it: and whosoeuer shall lose his life for my sake, shall finde it. 
\v 26 For what shall it profite a man though he should winne the whole worlde, if hee lose his owne soule? or what shall a man giue for recompence of his soule? 
\v 27 For the Sonne of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his Angels, and then shall he giue to euery man according to his deedes. 
\v 28 Verely I say vnto you, there bee some of them that stande here, which shall not taste of death, till they haue seene the Sonne of man come in his kingdome. 
\c 17  
\p
\v 1 And after sixe dayes, Iesus tooke Peter, and Iames and Iohn his brother, and brought them vp into an hie mountaine apart, 
\v 2 And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the Sunne, and his clothes were as white as the light. 
\v 3 And beholde, there appeared vnto them Moses, and Elias, talking with him. 
\v 4 Then answered Peter, and saide to Iesus, Master, it is good for vs to be here: if thou wilt, let vs make here three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias. 
\v 5 While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloude shadowed them: and beholde, there came a voyce out of the cloude, saying, This is that my beloued Sonne, in whom I am well pleased: heare him. 
\v 6 And when the disciples heard that, they fell on their faces, and were sore afraide. 
\v 7 Then Iesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraide. 
\v 8 And when they lifted vp their eyes, they sawe no man, saue Iesus onely. 
\v 9 And as they came downe from the moutaine, Iesus charged them, saying, Shewe the vision to no man, vntil the Sonne of man rise againe from the dead. 
\v 10 And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the Scribes that Elias must first come? 
\v 11 And Iesus answered, and saide vnto them, Certeinely Elias must first come, and restore all thinges. 
\v 12 But I say vnto you that Elias is come alreadie, and they knewe him not, but haue done vnto him whatsoeuer they would: likewise shall also the Sonne of man suffer of them. 
\v 13 Then the disciples perceiued that he spake vnto them of Iohn Baptist. 
\v 14 And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a certaine man, and fell downe at his feete, 
\v 15 And saide, Master, haue pitie on my sonne: for he is lunatike, and is sore vexed: for oft times he falleth into the fire, and oft times into the water. 
\v 16 And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not heale him. 
\v 17 Then Iesus answered, and said, O generation faithlesse, and crooked, how long now shall I be with you! howe long nowe shall I suffer you! bring him hither to me. 
\v 18 And Iesus rebuked the deuill, and he went out of him: and the childe was healed at that houre. 
\v 19 Then came the disciples to Iesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out? 
\v 20 And Iesus said vnto them, Because of your vnbeliefe: for verely I say vnto you, if ye haue faith as much as is a graine of mustarde seede, ye shall say vnto this mountaine, Remooue hence to yonder place, and it shall remoue: and nothing shalbe vnpossible vnto you. 
\v 21 Howbeit this kinde goeth not out, but by prayer and fasting. 
\v 22 And they being in Galile, Iesus said vnto them, The Sonne of man shall be deliuered into the handes of men, 
\v 23 And they shall kill him, but the thirde day shall he rise againe: and they were very sorie. 
\v 24 And when they were come to Capernaum, they that receiued polle money, came to Peter, and sayd, Doeth not your Master pay polle money? 
\v 25 He sayd, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Iesus preuented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? Of whome doe the Kings of the earth take tribute, or polle money? of their children, or of strangers? 
\v 26 Peter sayd vnto him, Of strangers. Then said Iesus vnto him, Then are the children free. 
\v 27 Neuerthelesse, lest we should offend them: goe to the sea, and cast in an angle, and take the first fish that commeth vp, and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt finde a piece of twentie pence: that take, and giue it vnto them for me and thee. 
\c 18  
\p
\v 1 The same time the disciples came vnto Iesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdome of heauen? 
\v 2 And Iesus called a litle childe vnto him, and set him in the mids of them, 
\v 3 And sayd, Verely I say vnto you, except ye be conuerted, and become as litle children, ye shall not enter into the kingdome of heauen. 
\v 4 Whosoeuer therefore shall humble himselfe as this litle childe, the same is the greatest in the kingdome of heauen. 
\v 5 And whosoeuer shall receiue one such litle childe in my name, receiueth me. 
\v 6 But whosoeuer shall offend one of these litle ones which beleeue in me, it were better for him, that a milstone were hanged about his necke, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea. 
\v 7 Wo be vnto the world because of offences: for it must needes be that offences shall come, but wo be to that man by whome the offence commeth. 
\v 8 Wherefore, if thy hand or thy foote cause thee to offend, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life, halt, or maimed, then hauing two hands, or two feete, to be cast into euerlasting fire. 
\v 9 And if thine eye cause thee to offende, plucke it out, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, then hauing two eyes to be cast into hell fire. 
\v 10 See that ye despise not one of these litle ones: for I say vnto you, that in heauen their Angels alwayes behold the face of my Father which is in heauen. 
\v 11 For the Sonne of man is come to saue that which was lost. 
\v 12 How thinke ye? If a man haue an hundreth sheepe, and one of them be gone astray, doeth he not leaue ninetie and nine, and go into the mountaines, and seeke that which is gone astray? 
\v 13 And if so be that he finde it, verely I say vnto you, he reioyceth more of that sheepe, then of the ninetie and nine which went not astray: 
\v 14 So is it not ye wil of your Father which is in heauen, that one of these litle ones should perish. 
\v 15 Moreouer, if thy brother trespasse against thee, goe and tell him his fault betweene thee and him alone: if he heare thee, thou hast wonne thy brother. 
\v 16 But if he heare thee not, take yet with thee one or two, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses euery worde may be confirmed. 
\v 17 And if he refuse to heare them, tell it vnto the Church: and if he refuse to heare the Church also, let him be vnto thee as an heathen man, and a Publicane. 
\v 18 Verely I say vnto you, Whatsoeuer ye bind on earth, shall be bound in heauen: and whatsoeuer ye loose on earth, shalbe loosed in heauen. 
\v 19 Againe, verely I say vnto you, that if two of you shall agree in earth vpon any thing, whatsoeuer they shall desire, it shall be giuen them of my Father which is in heauen. 
\v 20 For where two or three are gathered together in my Name, there am I in the mids of them. 
\v 21 Then came Peter to him, and said, Master, howe oft shall my brother sinne against me, and I shall forgiue him? vnto seuen times? 
\v 22 Iesus said vnto him, I say not to thee, Vnto seuen times, but, Vnto seuentie times seuen times. 
\v 23 Therefore is the kingdome of heauen likened vnto a certaine King, which would take an account of his seruants. 
\v 24 And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought vnto him, which ought him ten thousand talents. 
\v 25 And because he had nothing to pay, his Lord commanded him to be solde, and his wife, and his children, and all that he had, and the dette to be payed. 
\v 26 The seruant therefore fell downe, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, refraine thine anger toward me, and I will pay thee all. 
\v 27 Then that seruants Lord had compassion, and loosed him, and forgaue him the dette. 
\v 28 But when the seruant was departed, hee found one of his felow seruants, which ought him an hundred pence, and he layde hands on him, and thratled him, saying, Pay me that thou owest. 
\v 29 Then his fellow seruant fell downe at his feete, and besought him, saying, Refraine thine anger towards me, and I will pay thee all. 
\v 30 Yet he would not, but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the dette. 
\v 31 And when his other felowe seruants sawe what was done, they were very sory, and came, and declared vnto their Lord all that was done. 
\v 32 Then his Lord called him vnto him, and sayd to him, O euil seruant, I forgaue thee all that dette, because thou prayedst me. 
\v 33 Oughtest not thou also to haue had pitie on thy fellowe seruant, euen as I had pitie on thee? 
\v 34 So his Lord was wroth, and deliuered him to the tormentours, till he should pay all that was due to him. 
\v 35 So likewise shall mine heauenly Father doe vnto you, except ye forgiue from your hearts, eche one to his brother their trespasses. 
\c 19  
\p
\v 1 And it came to passe, that when Iesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galile, and came into ye coasts of Iudea beyond Iordan. 
\v 2 And great multitudes followed him, and he healed them there. 
\v 3 Then came vnto him the Pharises tempting him, and saying to him, Is it lawfull for a man to put away his wife vpon euery occasion? 
\v 4 And he answered and sayd vnto them, Haue ye not read, that hee which made them at the beginning, made them male and female, 
\v 5 And sayd, For this cause, shall a man leaue father and mother, and cleaue vnto his wife, and they which were two shalbe one flesh. 
\v 6 Wherefore they are no more twaine, but one flesh. Let not man therefore put asunder that, which God hath coupled together. 
\v 7 They said to him, Why did then Moses commaund to giue a bill of diuorcement, and to put her away? 
\v 8 He sayd vnto them, Moses, because of the hardnesse of your heart, suffered you to put away your wiues: but from the beginning it was not so. 
\v 9 I say therefore vnto you, that whosoeuer shall put away his wife, except it be for whoredome, and marry another, committeth adulterie: and whosoeuer marieth her which is diuorced, doeth commit adulterie. 
\v 10 Then sayd his disciples to him, If the matter be so betweene man and wife, it is not good to marry. 
\v 11 But he sayd vnto them, All men cannot receiue this thing, saue they to whom it is giuen. 
\v 12 For there are some eunuches, which were so borne of their mothers belly: and there be some eunuches, which be gelded by men: and there be some eunuches, which haue gelded them selues for the kingdome of heauen. He that is able to receiue this, let him receiue it. 
\v 13 Then were brought to him litle children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them. 
\v 14 But Iesus sayd, Suffer the litle children, and forbid them not to come to me: for of such is the kingdome of heauen. 
\v 15 And when he had put his hands on them, he departed thence. 
\v 16 And beholde, one came and sayd vnto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I doe, that I may haue eternall life? 
\v 17 And he said vnto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, eue God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keepe ye commandemets. 
\v 18 He sayd to him, Which? And Iesus sayde, These, Thou shalt not kill: Thou shalt not commit adulterie: Thou shalt not steale: Thou shalt not beare false witnesse. 
\v 19 Honour thy father and mother: and thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe. 
\v 20 The yong man sayd vnto him, I haue obserued all these things from my youth: what lacke I yet? 
\v 21 Iesus sayd vnto him, If thou wilt be perfite, go, sell that thou hast, and giue it to the poore, and thou shalt haue treasure in heauen, and come, and follow me. 
\v 22 And when the yong man heard that saying, he went away sorowfull: for he had great possessions. 
\v 23 Then Iesus sayd vnto his disciples, Verely I say vnto you, that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdome of heauen. 
\v 24 And againe I say vnto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, then for a rich man to enter into ye kingdome of God. 
\v 25 And whe his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amased, saying, Who then can be saued? 
\v 26 And Iesus behelde them, and sayde vnto them, With men this is vnpossible, but with God all things are possible. 
\v 27 Then answered Peter, and said to him, Beholde, we haue forsaken all, and followed thee: what therefore shall we haue? 
\v 28 And Iesus said vnto them, Verely I say to you, that when the Sonne of man shall sit in the throne of his maiestie, ye which folowed me in the regeneration, shall sit also vpon twelue thrones and iudge the twelue tribes of Israel. 
\v 29 And whosoeuer shall forsake houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my Names sake, he shall receiue an hundreth folde more, and shall inherite euerlasting life. 
\v 30 But many that are first, shalbe last, and the last shalbe first. 
\c 20  
\p
\v 1 For the kingdome of heauen is like vnto a certaine, housholder, which went out at the dawning of the day to hire labourers into his vineyarde. 
\v 2 And he agreed with the labourers for a peny a day, and sent them into his vineyard. 
\v 3 And he went out about the third houre, and sawe other standing idle in the market place, 
\v 4 And sayd vnto them, Goe ye also into my vineyard, and whatsoeuer is right, I will giue you: and they went their way. 
\v 5 Againe he went out about the sixt and ninth houre, and did likewise. 
\v 6 And he went about the eleuenth houre, and found other standing idle, and sayd vnto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle? 
\v 7 They sayd vnto him, Because no man hath hired vs. He sayd to them, Goe ye also into my vineyard, and whatsoeuer is right, that shall ye receiue. 
\v 8 And when euen was come, the master of the vineyard sayd vnto his steward, Call the labourers, and giue them their hire, beginning at the last, till thou come to the first. 
\v 9 And they which were hired about ye eleuenth houre, came and receiued euery man a penie. 
\v 10 Nowe when the first came, they supposed that they should receiue more, but they likewise receiued euery man a penie. 
\v 11 And when they had receiued it, they murmured against the master of the house, 
\v 12 Saying, These last haue wrought but one houre, and thou hast made them equall vnto vs, which haue borne the burden and heate of the day. 
\v 13 And hee answered one of them, saying, Friend, I doe thee no wrong: didst thou not agree with me for a penie? 
\v 14 Take that which is thine owne, and go thy way: I will giue vnto this last, as much as to thee. 
\v 15 Is it not lawfull for me to do as I will with mine owne? Is thine eye euil, because I am good? 
\v 16 So the last shalbe first, and the first last: for many are called, but fewe chosen. 
\v 17 And Iesus went vp to Hierusalem, and tooke the twelue disciples apart in the way, and said vnto them, 
\v 18 Beholde, wee goe vp to Hierusalem, and the Sonne of man shall bee deliuered vnto the chiefe priestes, and vnto the Scribes, and they shall condemne him to death, 
\v 19 And shall deliuer him to the Gentiles, to mocke, and to scourge, and to crucifie him, but the third day he shall rise againe. 
\v 20 Then came to him the mother of Zebedeus children with her sonnes, worshipping him, and desiring a certaine thing of him. 
\v 21 And he said vnto her, What wouldest thou? She said to him, Graunt that these my two sonnes may sit, the one at thy right hand, and the other at thy left hand in thy kingdome. 
\v 22 And Iesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye aske. Are ye able to drinke of the cup that I shall drinke of, and to be baptized with the baptisme that I shalbe baptized with? They said to him, We are able. 
\v 23 And he said vnto them, Ye shall drinke in deede of my cup, and shall be baptized with the baptisme, that I am baptized with, but to sit at my right hande, and at my left hand, is not mine to giue: but it shalbe giuen to them for whome it is prepared of my Father. 
\v 24 And when the other ten heard this, they disdained at the two brethren. 
\v 25 Therefore Iesus called them vnto him, and saide, We knowe that the lordes of the Gentiles haue domination ouer them, and they that are great, exercise authoritie ouer them. 
\v 26 But it shall not be so among you: but whosoeuer will be great among you, let him be your seruant. 
\v 27 And whosoeuer will be chiefe among you, let him be your seruant. 
\v 28 Euen as the Sonne of man came not to be serued, but to serue, and to giue his life for the ransome of many. 
\v 29 And as they departed from Iericho, a great multitude followed him. 
\v 30 And beholde, two blinde men, sitting by the way side, when they heard that Iesus passed by, cryed, saying, O Lord, the Sonne of Dauid, haue mercie on vs. 
\v 31 And the multitude rebuked them, because they should holde their peace: but they cried the more, saying, O Lord, the Sonne of Dauid, haue mercie on vs. 
\v 32 Then Iesus stoode still, and called them, and said, What will ye that I should do to you? 
\v 33 They saide to him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened. 
\v 34 And Iesus mooued with compassion, touched their eyes, and immediatly their eyes receiued sight, and they followed him. 
\c 21  
\p
\v 1 And when they drewe neere to Hierusalem, and were come to Bethphage, vnto the mount of the Oliues, then sent Iesus two disciples, 
\v 2 Saying to them, Goe into the towne that is ouer against you, and anon yee shall finde an asse bounde, and a colt with her: loose them, and bring them vnto me. 
\v 3 And if any man say ought vnto you, say ye, that the Lord hath neede of them, and straightway he will let them goe. 
\v 4 All this was done that it might be fulfilled, which was spoken by the Prophet, saying, 
\v 5 Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Beholde, thy King commeth vnto thee, meeke and sitting vpon an asse, and a colte, the foale of an asse vsed to the yoke. 
\v 6 So the disciples went, and did as Iesus had commanded them, 
\v 7 And brought the asse and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and set him thereon. 
\v 8 And a great multitude spred their garments in the way: and other cut downe branches from the trees, and strawed them in the way. 
\v 9 Moreouer, the people that went before, and they also that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the Sonne of Dauid, Blessed be hee that commeth in the Name of the Lord, Hosanna thou which art in the highest heauens. 
\v 10 And when he was come into Hierusalem, all the citie was mooued, saying, Who is this? 
\v 11 And the people said, This is Iesus that Prophet of Nazareth in Galile. 
\v 12 And Iesus went into the Temple of God, and cast out all them that solde and bought in the Temple, and ouerthrew the tables of the money chagers, and the seates of them that sold doues, 
\v 13 And said to them, it is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer: but ye haue made it a denne of theeues. 
\v 14 Then the blinde, and the halt came to him in the Temple, and he healed them. 
\v 15 But when the chiefe priestes and Scribes sawe the marueiles that hee did, and the children crying in the Temple, and saying, Hosanna to the Sonne of Dauid, they disdained, 
\v 16 And said vnto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Iesus said vnto them, Yea: read ye neuer, By the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast made perfite the praise? 
\v 17 So hee left them, and went out of the citie vnto Bethania, and lodged there. 
\v 18 And in the morning, as he returned into the citie, he was hungrie, 
\v 19 And seeing a figge tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaues onely, and said to it, Neuer fruite grow on thee henceforwards. And anon the figge tree withered. 
\v 20 And when his disciples saw it, they marueiled, saying, How soone is the figge tree withered! 
\v 21 And Iesus answered and said vnto them, Verely I say vnto you, if ye haue faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only doe that, which I haue done to the figge tree, but also if ye say vnto this mountaine, Take thy selfe away, and cast thy selfe into the sea, it shalbe done. 
\v 22 And whatsoeuer ye shall aske in prayer, if ye beleeue, ye shall receiue it. 
\v 23 And whe he was come into the Temple, the chiefe Priestes, and the Elders of the people came vnto him, as he was teaching, and saide, By what authoritie doest thou these things? and who gaue thee this authoritie? 
\v 24 Then Iesus answered and said vnto them, I also will aske of you a certaine thing, which if ye tell me, I likewise will tell you by what authoritie I doe these things. 
\v 25 The baptisme of Iohn, whence was it? from heauen, or of men? Then they reasoned among themselues, saying, If we shall say, From heauen, he will say vnto vs, Why did ye not then beleeue him? 
\v 26 And if we say, Of men, we feare the multitude, for all holde Iohn as a Prophet. 
\v 27 Then they answered Iesus, and said, We can not tell. And he said vnto them, Neither tell I you by what authoritie I doe these things. 
\v 28 But what thinke ye? A certaine man had two sonnes, and came to the elder, and saide, Sonne, goe and worke to day in my vineyarde. 
\v 29 But he answered, and said, I will not: yet afterward he repented himselfe, and went. 
\v 30 Then came he to the second, and said likewise. And he answered, and said, I will, Syr: yet he went not. 
\v 31 Whether of them twaine did the will of the father? They saide vnto him, The first. Iesus saide vnto them, Verely I say vnto you, that the Publicanes and the harlots goe before you into the kingdome of God. 
\v 32 For Iohn came vnto you in the way of righteousnes, and yee beleeued him not: but the Publicanes, and the harlots beleeued him, and ye, though ye sawe it, were not mooued with repentance afterward, that ye might beleeue him. 
\v 33 Heare another parable, There was a certaine housholder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and made a winepresse therein, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a strange countrey. 
\v 34 And when the time of the fruite drewe neere, hee sent his seruants to the husbandmen to receiue the fruites thereof. 
\v 35 And ye husbandmen tooke his seruants and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another. 
\v 36 Againe hee sent other seruants, moe then the first: and they did the like vnto them. 
\v 37 But last of all he sent vnto them his owne sonne, saying, They will reuerence my sonne. 
\v 38 But when the husbandmen saw the sonne, they saide among themselues, This is the heire: come, let vs kill him, and let vs take his inheritance. 
\v 39 So they tooke him, and cast him out of the vineyarde, and slewe him. 
\v 40 When therefore the Lord of the vineyarde shall come, what will hee doe to those husbandmen? 
\v 41 They saide vnto him, Hee will cruelly destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard vnto other husbandmen, which shall deliuer him the fruites in their seasons. 
\v 42 Iesus saide vnto them, Read ye neuer in the Scriptures, The stone which the builders refused, the same is made the head of the corner? This was the Lordes doing, and it is marueilous in our eyes. 
\v 43 Therefore say I vnto you, The kingdome of God shalbe taken from you, and shalbe giuen to a nation, which shall bring foorth the fruites thereof. 
\v 44 And whosoeuer shall fall on this stone, he shalbe broken: but on whomsoeuer it shall fall, it will dash him a pieces. 
\v 45 And when the chiefe Priestes and Pharises had heard his parables, they perceiued that hee spake of them. 
\v 46 And they seeking to laye handes on him, feared the people, because they tooke him as a Prophet. 
\c 22  
\p
\v 1 Then Iesus answered, and spake vnto them againe in parables, saying, 
\v 2 The kingdome of heauen is like vnto a certaine King which maried his sonne, 
\v 3 And sent foorth his seruants, to call them that were bidde to the wedding, but they woulde not come. 
\v 4 Againe hee sent foorth other seruants, saying. Tell them which are bidden, Beholde, I haue prepared my dinner: mine oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all thinges are readie: come vnto the mariage. 
\v 5 But they made light of it, and went their wayes, one to his farme, and another about his marchandise. 
\v 6 And the remnant tooke his seruants, and intreated them sharpely, and slewe them. 
\v 7 But when the King heard it, he was wroth, and sent foorth his warriers, and destroyed those murtherers, and burnt vp their citie. 
\v 8 Then saide hee to his seruants, Truely the wedding is prepared: but they which were bidden, were not worthy. 
\v 9 Go ye therefore out into the high wayes, and as many as ye finde, bid them to the mariage. 
\v 10 So those seruantes went out into the hie wayes, and gathered together all that euer they found, both good and bad: so the wedding was furnished with ghestes. 
\v 11 Then the King came in, to see the ghestes, and sawe there a man which had not on a wedding garment. 
\v 12 And he sayd vnto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither, and hast not on a wedding garment? And he was speachlesse. 
\v 13 Then sayd the King to the seruants, Binde him hand and foote: take him away, and cast him into vtter darkenes: there shalbe weeping and gnashing of teeth. 
\v 14 For many are called, but fewe chosen. 
\v 15 Then went the Pharises and tooke counsell how they might tangle him in talke. 
\v 16 And they sent vnto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we knowe that thou art true, and teachest the way of God truely, neither carest for any man: for thou considerest not the person of men. 
\v 17 Tell vs therefore, how thinkest thou? Is it lawfull to giue tribute vnto Cesar, or not? 
\v 18 But Iesus perceiued their wickednes, and sayd, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites? 
\v 19 Shewe me the tribute money. And they brought him a peny. 
\v 20 And he sayde vnto them, Whose is this image and superscription? 
\v 21 They sayd vnto him, Cesars. Then sayd he vnto them, Giue therefore to Cesar, the things which are Cesars, and giue vnto God, those things which are Gods. 
\v 22 And when they heard it, they marueiled, and left him, and went their way. 
\v 23 The same day the Sadduces came to him (which say that there is no resurrection) and asked him, 
\v 24 Saying, Master, Moses sayd, If a man die, hauing no children, his brother shall marie his wife by the right of alliance, and raise vp seede vnto his brother. 
\v 25 Nowe there were with vs seuen brethren, and the first maried a wife, and deceased: and hauing none yssue, left his wife vnto his brother. 
\v 26 Likewise also the second, and the third, vnto the seuenth. 
\v 27 And last of all the woman died also. 
\v 28 Therefore in the resurrection, whose wife shall she be of the seuen? for all had her. 
\v 29 Then Iesus answered, and sayd vnto them, Ye are deceiued, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God. 
\v 30 For in the resurrection they neither marie wiues, nor wiues are bestowed in mariage, but are as the Angels of God in heauen. 
\v 31 And concerning the resurrection of the dead, haue ye not read what is spoken vuto you of God, saying, 
\v 32 I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Iacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the liuing. 
\v 33 And when the multitude heard it, they were astonied at his doctrine. 
\v 34 But when the Pharises had heard, that he had put the Sadduces to silence, they assembled together. 
\v 35 And one of them, which was an expounder of the Lawe, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying, 
\v 36 Master, which is ye great commandement in the Lawe? 
\v 37 Iesus sayd to him, Thou shalt loue the Lord thy God with all thine heart, with all thy soule, and with all thy minde. 
\v 38 This is the first and the great commandement. 
\v 39 And the second is like vnto this, Thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe. 
\v 40 On these two commandements hangeth the whole Lawe, and the Prophets. 
\v 41 While the Pharises were gathered together, Iesus asked them, 
\v 42 Saying, What thinke ye of Christ? whose sonne is he? They sayd vnto him, Dauids. 
\v 43 He sayd vnto them, How then doeth Dauid in spirit call him Lord, saying, 
\v 44 The Lord sayd to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footestoole? 
\v 45 If then Dauid call him Lord, howe is he his sonne? 
\v 46 And none could answere him a worde, neither durst any from that day foorth aske him any moe questions. 
\c 23  
\p
\v 1 Then spake Iesus to the multitude, and to his disciples, 
\v 2 Saying, The Scribes and the Pharises sit in Moses seate. 
\v 3 All therefore whatsoeuer they bid you obserue, that obserue and doe: but after their workes doe not: for they say, and doe not. 
\v 4 For they binde heauie burdens, and grieuous to be borne, and lay them on mens shoulders, but they themselues will not moue them with one of their fingers. 
\v 5 All their workes they doe for to be seene of men: for they make their phylacteries broad, and make long the frindges of their garments, 
\v 6 And loue the chiefe place at feastes, and to haue the chiefe seates in the assemblies, 
\v 7 And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi. 
\v 8 But be not ye called, Rabbi: for one is your doctour, to wit, Christ, and all ye are brethren. 
\v 9 And call no man your father vpon the earth: for there is but one, your father which is in heauen. 
\v 10 Be not called doctours: for one is your doctour, euen Christ. 
\v 11 But he that is greatest among you, let him be your seruant. 
\v 12 For whosoeuer will exalt himselfe, shall be brought lowe: and whosoeuer will humble himselfe, shalbe exalted. 
\v 13 Wo therefore be vnto you, Scribes and Pharises, hypocrites, because ye shut vp the kingdome of heauen before men: for ye your selues go not in, neither suffer ye them that would enter, to come in. 
\v 14 Wo be vnto you, Scribes and Pharises, hypocrites: for ye deuoure widowes houses, euen vnder a colour of long prayers: wherefore ye shall receiue the greater damnation. 
\v 15 Wo be vnto you, Scribes and Pharises, hypocrites: for ye compasse sea and land to make one of your profession: and when he is made, ye make him two folde more the childe of hell, then you your selues. 
\v 16 Wo be vnto you blinde guides, which say, Whosoeuer sweareth by the Temple, it is nothing: but whosoeuer sweareth by the golde of the Temple, he offendeth. 
\v 17 Ye fooles and blinde, whether is greater, the golde, or the Temple that sanctifieth the golde? 
\v 18 And whosoeuer sweareth by the altar, it is nothing: but whosoeuer sweareth by the offering that is vpon it, offendeth. 
\v 19 Ye fooles and blinde, whether is greater, the offering, or the altar which sanctifieth the offering? 
\v 20 Whosoeuer therefore sweareth by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon. 
\v 21 And whosoeuer sweareth by the Temple, sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth therein. 
\v 22 And he that sweareth by heauen, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon. 
\v 23 Wo be to you, Scribes and Pharises, hypocrites: for ye tithe mynt, and annyse, and cummyn, and leaue the weightier matters of the law, as iudgement, and mercy and fidelitie. These ought ye to haue done, and not to haue left the other. 
\v 24 Ye blinde guides, which straine out a gnat, and swallowe a camell. 
\v 25 Wo be to you, Scribes and Pharises, hypocrites: for ye make cleane the vtter side of the cup, and of the platter: but within they are ful of briberie and excesse. 
\v 26 Thou blinde Pharise, cleanse first the inside of the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be cleane also. 
\v 27 Wo be to you, Scribes and Pharises, hypocrites: for ye are like vnto whited tombes, which appeare beautifull outward, but are within full of dead mens bones, and all filthines. 
\v 28 So are ye also: for outwarde ye appeare righteous vnto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisie and iniquitie. 
\v 29 Wo be vnto you, Scribes and Pharises, hypocrites: for ye build the tombes of the Prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous, 
\v 30 And say, If we had bene in the dayes of our fathers, we would not haue bene partners with them in the blood of the Prophets. 
\v 31 So then ye be witnesses vnto your selues, that ye are the children of them that murthered the Prophets. 
\v 32 Fulfill ye also ye measure of your fathers. 
\v 33 O serpents, the generation of vipers, howe should ye escape the damnation of hell! 
\v 34 Wherefore beholde, I send vnto you Prophets, and wise men, and Scribes, and of them ye shall kill and crucifie: and of them shall ye scourge in your Synagogues, and persecute from citie to citie, 
\v 35 That vpon you may come all the righteous blood that was shed vpon the earth, from the blood of Abel the righteous, vnto the blood of Zacharias the sonne of Barachias, whome ye slewe betweene the Temple and the altar. 
\v 36 Verely I say vnto you, all these things shall come vpon this generation. 
\v 37 Hierusalem, Hierusalem, which killest the Prophets, and stonest them which are sent to thee, how often would I haue gathered thy children together, as the henne gathereth her chickins vnder her wings, and ye would not! 
\v 38 Beholde, your habitation shalbe left vnto you desolate, 
\v 39 For I say vnto you, ye shall not see mee henceforth till that ye say, Blessed is he that commeth in the Name of the Lord. 
\c 24  
\p
\v 1 And Iesus went out, and departed from the Temple, and his disciples came to him, to shewe him the building of the Temple. 
\v 2 And Iesus sayd vnto them, See ye not all these things? Verely I say vnto you, there shall not be here left a stone vpon a stone, that shall not be cast downe. 
\v 3 And as he sate vpon the mount of Oliues, his disciples came vnto him apart, saying, Tell vs when these things shall be, and what signe shalbe of thy comming, and of the ende of the world. 
\v 4 And Iesus answered, and sayd vnto them, Take heede that no man deceiue you. 
\v 5 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ, and shall deceiue many. 
\v 6 And ye shall heare of warres, and rumours of warres: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to passe, but the end is not yet. 
\v 7 For nation shall rise against nation, and realme against realme, and there shalbe famine, and pestilence, and earthquakes in diuers places. 
\v 8 All these are but ye beginning of sorowes. 
\v 9 Then shall they deliuer you vp to be afflicted, and shall kill you, and ye shall be hated of all nations for my Names sake. 
\v 10 And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another. 
\v 11 And many false prophets shall arise, and shall deceiue many. 
\v 12 And because iniquitie shalbe increased, the loue of many shalbe colde. 
\v 13 But he that endureth to the ende, he shalbe saued. 
\v 14 And this Gospel of the kingdome shalbe preached through the whole world for a witnes vnto all nations, and then shall the end come. 
\v 15 When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the Prophet, set in the holy place (let him that readeth consider it.) 
\v 16 Then let them which be in Iudea, flee into the mountaines. 
\v 17 Let him which is on the house top, not come downe to fetch any thing out of his house. 
\v 18 And he that is in the fielde, let not him returne backe to fetch his clothes. 
\v 19 And woe shalbe to them that are with childe, and to them that giue sucke in those dayes. 
\v 20 But pray that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the Sabbath day. 
\v 21 For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not from the beginning of the worlde to this time, nor shalbe. 
\v 22 And except those dayes should be shortened, there should no flesh be saued: but for the elects sake those dayes shalbe shortened. 
\v 23 Then if any shall say vnto you, Loe, here is Christ, or there, beleeue it not. 
\v 24 For there shall arise false Christes, and false prophets, and shall shewe great signes and wonders, so that if it were possible, they should deceiue the very elect. 
\v 25 Beholde, I haue tolde you before. 
\v 26 Wherefore if they shall say vnto you, Beholde, he is in the desert, goe not forth: Beholde, he is in the secret places, beleeue it not. 
\v 27 For as the lightning commeth out of the East, and is seene into the West, so shall also the comming of the Sonne of man be. 
\v 28 For wheresoeuer a dead carkeis is, thither will the Egles be gathered together. 
\v 29 And immediatly after ye tribulations of those dayes, shall the sunne be darkened, and the moone shall not giue her light, and the starres shall fal from heauen, and ye powers of heaue shalbe shake. 
\v 30 And then shall appeare the signe of the Sonne of man in heauen: and then shall all the kinreds of the earth mourne, and they shall see the Sonne of man come in the cloudes of heauen with power and great glorie. 
\v 31 And he shall send his Angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect, from the foure windes, and from the one ende of the heauens vnto the other. 
\v 32 Now learne the parable of the figge tree: when her bough is yet tender, and it putteth foorth leaues, ye knowe that sommer is neere. 
\v 33 So likewise ye, when ye see all these things, know that the kingdom of God is neere, eue at ye doores. 
\v 34 Verely I say vnto you, this generation shall not passe, till all these things be done. 
\v 35 Heauen and earth shall passe away: but my wordes shall not passe away. 
\v 36 But of that day and houre knoweth no man, no not the Angels of heauen, but my father only. 
\v 37 But as the dayes of Noe were, so likewise shall the comming of the Sonne of man be. 
\v 38 For as in the dayes before the flood, they did eate and drinke, marrie, and giue in mariage, vnto the day that Noe entred into the Arke, 
\v 39 And knewe nothing, till the flood came, and tooke them all away, so shall also the comming of the Sonne of man be. 
\v 40 Then two shall be in the fieldes, the one shalbe receiued, and the other shalbe refused. 
\v 41 Two women shalbe grinding at ye mill: the one shalbe receiued, and the other shalbe refused. 
\v 42 Watch therefore: for ye knowe not what houre your master will come. 
\v 43 Of this be sure, that if the good man of the house knewe at what watch the thiefe would come, he woulde surely watch, and not suffer his house to be digged through. 
\v 44 Therefore be ye also ready: for in the houre that ye thinke not, will the Sonne of man come. 
\v 45 Who then is a faithfull seruaunt and wise, whom his master hath made ruler ouer his household, to giue them meate in season? 
\v 46 Blessed is that seruant, whom his master when he commeth, shall finde so doing. 
\v 47 Verely I say vnto you, he shall make him ruler ouer all his goods. 
\v 48 But if that euil seruant shall say in his heart, My master doth deferre his comming, 
\v 49 And begin to smite his fellowes, and to eate, and to drinke with the drunken, 
\v 50 That seruaunts master will come in a day, when he looketh not for him, and in an houre that he is not ware of, 
\v 51 And will cut him off, and giue him his portion with hypocrites: there shalbe weeping, and gnashing of teeth. 
\c 25  
\p
\v 1 Then the kingdome of heauen shalbe likened vnto tenne virgins, which tooke their lampes, and went foorth to meete the bridegrome. 
\v 2 And fiue of them were wise, and fiue foolish. 
\v 3 The foolish tooke their lampes, but tooke none oyle with them. 
\v 4 But the wise tooke oyle in their vessels with their lampes. 
\v 5 Nowe while the bridegrome taried long, all slumbred and slept. 
\v 6 And at midnight there was a crie made, Behold, the bridegrome commeth: goe out to meete him. 
\v 7 Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lampes. 
\v 8 And the foolish said to the wise, Giue vs of your oyle, for our lampes are out. 
\v 9 But the wise answered, saying, Not so, lest there will not be ynough for vs and you: but goe ye rather to them that sell, and bye for your selues. 
\v 10 And while they went to bye, the bridegrome came: and they that were readie, went in with him to the wedding, and the gate was shut. 
\v 11 Afterwards came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to vs. 
\v 12 But he answered, and said, Verely I say vnto you, I knowe you not. 
\v 13 Watch therfore: for ye know neither the day, nor the houre, when the sonne of man will come. 
\v 14 For the kingdome of heauen is as a man that going into a strange countrey, called his seruants, and deliuered to them his goods. 
\v 15 And vnto one he gaue fiue talents, and to an other two, and to another one, to euery man after his own ability, and straightway went from home. 
\v 16 Then he that had receiued the fiue talents, went and occupied with them, and gained other fiue talents. 
\v 17 Likewise also, he that receiued two, he also gained other two. 
\v 18 But he that receiued that one, went and digged it in the earth, and hid his masters money. 
\v 19 But after a long season, the master of those seruants came, and reckoned with them. 
\v 20 Then came he that had receiued fiue talents, and brought other fiue talents, saying, Master, thou deliueredst vnto me fiue talents: behold, I haue gained with them other fiue talents. 
\v 21 Then his master saide vnto him, It is well done good seruant and faithfull, Thou hast bene faithfull in litle, I will make thee ruler ouer much: enter into thy masters ioy. 
\v 22 Also he that had receiued two talents, came, and said, Master, thou deliueredst vnto me two talents: behold, I haue gained two other talets more. 
\v 23 His master saide vnto him, It is well done good seruant, and faithfull, Thou hast bene faithfull in litle, I will make thee ruler ouer much: enter into thy masters ioy. 
\v 24 Then he which had receiued the one talent, came, and said, Master, I knewe that thou wast an hard man, which reapest where thou sowedst not, and gatherest where thou strawedst not: 
\v 25 I was therefore afraide, and went, and hid thy talent in the earth: behold, thou hast thine owne. 
\v 26 And his master answered, and said vnto him, Thou euill seruant, and slouthfull, thou knewest that I reape where I sowed not, and gather where I strawed not. 
\v 27 Thou oughtest therefore to haue put my money to ye exchangers, and then at my comming should I haue receiued mine owne with vantage. 
\v 28 Take therefore the talent from him, and giue it vnto him which hath tenne talents. 
\v 29 For vnto euery man that hath, it shall be giuen, and he shall haue abundance, and from him that hath not, euen that he hath, shalbe taken away. 
\v 30 Cast therefore that vnprofitable seruant into vtter darkenes: there shalbe weeping and gnasshing of teeth. 
\v 31 And when the Sonne of man commeth in his glory, and all the holy Angels with him, then shall he sit vpon the throne of his glorie, 
\v 32 And before him shalbe gathered all nations, and he shall seperate them one from another, as a shepheard separateth the sheepe from ye goates. 
\v 33 And he shall set the sheepe on his right hand, and the goates on the left. 
\v 34 Then shall ye king say to them on his right hand, Come ye blessed of my father: take the inheritance of the kingdome prepared for you from the foundation of the world. 
\v 35 For I was an hungred, and ye gaue me meate: I thirsted, and ye gaue me drinke: I was a stranger, and ye tooke me in vnto you. 
\v 36 I was naked, and ye clothed me: I was sicke, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came vnto me. 
\v 37 Then shall the righteous answere him, saying, Lord, when sawe we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or a thirst, and gaue thee drinke? 
\v 38 And when sawe we thee a stranger, and tooke thee in vnto vs? or naked, and clothed thee? 
\v 39 Or when sawe we thee sicke, or in prison, and came vnto thee? 
\v 40 And the King shall answere, and say vnto them, Verely I say vnto you, in as much as ye haue done it vnto one of the least of these my brethre, ye haue done it to me. 
\v 41 Then shall he say vnto them on ye left hand, Depart from me ye cursed, into euerlasting fire, which is prepared for the deuill and his angels. 
\v 42 For I was an hungred, and ye gaue me no meate: I thirsted, and ye gaue me no drinke: 
\v 43 I was a stranger, and ye tooke me not in vnto you: I was naked, and ye clothed me not: sicke, and in prison, and ye visited me not. 
\v 44 Then shall they also answere him, saying, Lord, when sawe we thee an hungred, or a thirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sicke, or in prison, and did not minister vnto thee? 
\v 45 Then shall he answere them, and say, Verely I say vnto you, in as much as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me. 
\v 46 And these shall goe into euerlasting paine, and the righteous into life eternall. 
\c 26  
\p
\v 1 And it came to passe, when Iesus had finished all these sayings, he saide vnto his disciples, 
\v 2 Ye know that after two dayes is ye Passeouer, and the Sonne of man shalbe deliuered to be crucified. 
\v 3 Then assembled together the chiefe Priests, and the Scribes, and the Elders of ye people into the hall of the high Priest called Caiaphas: 
\v 4 And consulted together that they might take Iesus by subtiltie, and kill him. 
\v 5 But they sayd, Not on the feast day, least any vprore be among the people. 
\v 6 And when Iesus was in Bethania, in the house of Simon the leper, 
\v 7 There came vnto him a woman, which had a boxe of very costly oyntment, and powred it on his head, as he sate at the table. 
\v 8 And when his disciples sawe it, they had indignation, saying, What needed this waste? 
\v 9 For this oyntment might haue bene solde for much, and bene giuen to the poore. 
\v 10 And Iesus knowing it, sayde vnto them, Why trouble yee the woman? for shee hath wrought a good woorke vpon me. 
\v 11 For yee haue the poore alwayes with you, but me shall yee not haue alwaies. 
\v 12 For in that shee powred this oyntment on my bodie, shee did it to burie me. 
\v 13 Verely I say vnto you, wheresoeuer this Gospel shall bee preached throughout all the worlde, there shall also this that shee hath done, be spoken of for a memoriall of her. 
\v 14 Then one of the twelue, called Iudas Iscariot, went vnto the chiefe Priestes, 
\v 15 And said, What will ye giue me, and I will deliuer him vnto you? and they appoynted vnto him thirtie pieces of siluer. 
\v 16 And from that time, he sought opportunitie to betraie him. 
\v 17 Nowe on the first day of the feast of vnleauened bread the disciples came to Iesus, saying vnto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eate the Passeouer? 
\v 18 And he said, Goe yee into the citie to such a man, and say to him, The master saieth, My time is at hande: I will keepe the Passeouer at thine house with my disciples. 
\v 19 And the disciples did as Iesus had giuen them charge, and made readie the Passeouer. 
\v 20 So when the Euen was come, hee sate downe with the twelue. 
\v 21 And as they did eate, he sayde, Verely I say vnto you, that one of you shall betraie me. 
\v 22 And they were exceeding sorowfull, and began euery one of them to say vnto him, Is it I, Master? 
\v 23 And hee answered and sayde, Hee that dippeth his hande with me in the dish, hee shall betraie me. 
\v 24 Surely the Sonne of man goeth his way, as it is written of him: but woe be to that man, by whom the Sonne of man is betrayed: it had bene good for that man, if hee had neuer bene borne. 
\v 25 Then Iudas which betraied him, answered and sayde, Is it I, Master? He sayde vnto him, Thou hast sayd it. 
\v 26 And as they did eate, Iesus tooke the bread, and when he had blessed, he brake it, and gaue it to the disciples, and sayd, Take, eate: this is my bodie. 
\v 27 Also he tooke the cuppe, and when he had giuen thankes, he gaue it them, saying, Drinke ye all of it. 
\v 28 For this is my blood of the Newe Testament, that is shedde for many, for the remission of sinnes. 
\v 29 I say vnto you, that I will not drinke henceforth of this fruit of the vine vntil that day, when I shall drinke it new with you in my Fathers kingdome. 
\v 30 And when they had sung a Psalme, they went out into the mount of Oliues. 
\v 31 Then saide Iesus vnto them, All yee shall be offended by me this night: for it is written, I wil smite the shepheard, and the sheepe of the flocke shalbe scattered. 
\v 32 But after I am risen againe, I will go before you into Galile. 
\v 33 But Peter aunswered, and sayde vnto him, Though that al men should be offended by thee, yet will I neuer be offended. 
\v 34 Iesus sayde vnto him, Verely I say vnto thee, that this night, before the cocke crow, thou shalt denie me thrise. 
\v 35 Peter saide vnto him, Though I should die with thee, I will in no case denie thee. Likewise also sayd all the disciples. 
\v 36 Then went Iesus with them into a place which is called Gethsemane, and said vnto his disciples, Sit ye here, while I goe, and pray yonder. 
\v 37 And hee tooke vnto him Peter, and the two sonnes of Zebedeus, and began to waxe sorowfull, and grieuously troubled. 
\v 38 Then sayde Iesus vnto them, My soule is very heauie, euen vnto the death: tarie yee here, and watch with me. 
\v 39 So hee went a litle further, and fell on his face, and praied, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup passe from me: neuerthelesse, not as I will, but as thou wilt. 
\v 40 After, hee came vnto the disciples, and founde them a sleepe, and sayde to Peter, What? coulde yee not watch with me one houre? 
\v 41 Watch, and praie, that yee enter not into tentation: the spirit in deede is readie, but the flesh is weake. 
\v 42 Againe he went away the second time, and praied, saying, O my Father, if this cuppe can not passe away from mee, but that I must drinke it, thy will be done. 
\v 43 And he came, and founde them a sleepe againe, for their eyes were heauie. 
\v 44 So he left them and went away againe, and praied the third time, saying the same woordes. 
\v 45 Then came he to his disciples, and said vnto them, Sleepe henceforth, and take your rest: behold, the houre is at hand, and the Sonne of man is giuen into the hands of sinners. 
\v 46 Rise, let vs goe: beholde, hee is at hande that betraieth me. 
\v 47 And while hee yet spake, loe Iudas, one of the twelue, came, and with him a great multitude with swordes and staues, from the high Priests and Elders of the people. 
\v 48 Now he that betraied him, had giuen them a token, saying, Whomesoeuer I shall kisse, that is he, laie holde on him. 
\v 49 And forthwith he came to Iesus, and sayd, God saue thee, Master, and kissed him. 
\v 50 Then Iesus sayde vnto him, Friende, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laide hands on Iesus, and tooke him. 
\v 51 And behold, one of them which were with Iesus, stretched out his hand, and drewe his sworde, and strooke a seruaunt of the high Priest, and smote off his eare. 
\v 52 Then sayde Iesus vnto him, Put vp thy sworde into his place: for all that take the sworde, shall perish with the sworde. 
\v 53 Either thinkest thou, that I can not now pray to my Father, and he will giue me moe then twelue legions of Angels? 
\v 54 Howe then shoulde the Scriptures bee fulfilled, which say, that it must be so? 
\v 55 The same houre sayde Iesus to the multitude, Ye be come out as it were against a thiefe, with swordes and staues to take mee: I sate daily teaching in the Temple among you, and yee tooke me not. 
\v 56 But all this was done, that the Scriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsooke him, and fled. 
\v 57 And they tooke Iesus, and led him to Caiaphas the hie Priest, where the Scribes and the Elders were assembled. 
\v 58 And Peter followed him a farre off vnto the hie Priestes hall, and went in, and sate with the seruants to see the ende. 
\v 59 Nowe the chiefe Priestes and the Elders, and all the whole councill sought false witnesse against Iesus, to put him to death. 
\v 60 But they founde none, and though many false witnesses came, yet founde they none: but at the last came two false witnesses, 
\v 61 And saide, This man saide, I can destroie the Temple of God, and build it in three daies. 
\v 62 Then the chiefe Priest arose, and sayde to him, Answerest thou nothing? What is the matter that these men witnesse against thee? 
\v 63 But Iesus helde his peace. Then the chiefe Priest answered, and saide to him, I charge thee sweare vnto vs by the liuing God, to tell vs, If thou be that Christ the Sonne of God, or no. 
\v 64 Iesus saide to him, Thou hast saide it: neuerthelesse I say vnto you, hereafter shall ye see the Sonne of man, sitting at the right hande of the power of God, and come in the cloudes of the heauen. 
\v 65 Then the hie Priest rent his clothes, saying, Hee hath blasphemed, what haue wee any more neede of witnesses? beholde: nowe yee haue heard his blasphemie. 
\v 66 What thinke yee? They answered, and said, He is guiltie of death. 
\v 67 Then spet they in his face, and buffeted him, and other smote him with roddes, 
\v 68 Saying, Prophecie to vs, O Christ, Who is he that smote thee? 
\v 69 Peter sate without in the hall, and a maide came to him, saying, Thou also wast with Iesus of Galile: 
\v 70 But hee denied before them all, saying, I wote not what thou saiest. 
\v 71 And when hee went out into the porche, another maide sawe him, and sayde vnto them that were there, This man was also with Iesus of Nazareth. 
\v 72 And againe he denied with an othe, saying, I knowe not the man. 
\v 73 So after a while, came vnto him they that stoode by, and sayde vnto Peter, Surely thou art also one of them: for euen thy speache bewraieth thee. 
\v 74 Then began hee to curse himselfe, and to sweare, saying, I knowe not the man. And immediately the cocke crewe. 
\v 75 Then Peter remembred the wordes of Iesus, which had sayde vnto him, Before the cocke crowe thou shalt denie me thrise. So he went out, and wept bitterly. 
\c 27  
\p
\v 1 When the morning was come, all the chiefe Priests, and the elders of the people tooke counsell against Iesus, to put him to death, 
\v 2 And led him away bounde, and deliuered him vnto Pontius Pilate the gouernour. 
\v 3 Then when Iudas which betraied him, sawe that hee was condemned, hee repented himselfe, and brought againe the thirtie pieces of siluer to the chiefe Priestes, and Elders, 
\v 4 Saying, I haue sinned, betraying the innocent bloud. But they sayde, What is that to vs? see thou to it. 
\v 5 And when hee had cast downe the siluer pieces in the Temple, hee departed, and went, and hanged himselfe. 
\v 6 And the chiefe Priestes tooke the siluer pieces, and sayde, It is not lawfull for vs to put them into the treasure, because it is the price of bloud. 
\v 7 And they tooke counsell, and bought with them a potters fielde, for the buriall of strangers. 
\v 8 Wherefore that field is called, The field of bloud, vntill this day. 
\v 9 (Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Ieremias the Prophet, saying, And they tooke thirtie siluer pieces, ye price of him that was valued, whom they of ye children of Israel valued. 
\v 10 And they gaue them for the potters fielde, as the Lord appointed me.) 
\v 11 And Iesus stood before ye gouernour, and the gouernour asked him, saying, Art thou that King of the Iewes? Iesus said vnto him, Thou sayest it. 
\v 12 And when he was accused of the chiefe Priestes, and Elders, he answered nothing. 
\v 13 Then saide Pilate vnto him, Hearest thou not howe many things they lay against thee? 
\v 14 But he answered him not to one worde, in so much that the gouernour marueiled greatly. 
\v 15 Nowe at the feast, the gouernour was wont to deliuer vnto the people a prisoner whom they would. 
\v 16 And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas. 
\v 17 When they were then gathered together, Pilate said vnto the, Whether will ye that I let loose vnto you Barabbas, or Iesus which is called Christ? 
\v 18 (For he knewe well, that for enuie they had deliuered him. 
\v 19 Also when he was set downe vpon the iudgement seate, his wife sent to him, saying, Haue thou nothing to do with that iust man: for I haue suffered many things this day in a dreame by reason of him.) 
\v 20 But the chiefe Priestes and the Elders had persuaded the people that they shoulde aske Barabbas, and should destroy Iesus. 
\v 21 Then the gouernour answered, and said vnto them, Whether of the twaine will ye that I let loose vnto you? And they said, Barabbas. 
\v 22 Pilate said vnto them, What shall I do then with Iesus, which is called Christ? They all said to him, Let him be crucified. 
\v 23 Then saide the gouernour, But what euill hath he done? Then they cryed the more, saying, Let him be crucified. 
\v 24 When Pilate saw that he auailed nothing, but that more tumult was made, he tooke water and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this iust man: looke you to it. 
\v 25 Then answered all the people, and saide, His bloud be on vs, and on our children. 
\v 26 Thus let he Barabbas loose vnto them, and scourged Iesus, and deliuered him to be crucified. 
\v 27 Then the souldiers of the gouernour tooke Iesus into the common hall, and gathered about him the whole band, 
\v 28 And they stripped him, and put about him a skarlet robe, 
\v 29 And platted a crowne of thornes, and put it vpon his head, and a reede in his right hand, and bowed their knees before him, and mocked him, saying, God saue thee King of the Iewes, 
\v 30 And spitted vpon him, and tooke a reede, and smote him on the head. 
\v 31 Thus when they had mocked him, they tooke the robe from him, and put his owne rayment on him, and led him away to crucifie him. 
\v 32 And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, named Simon: him they compelled to beare his crosse. 
\v 33 And when they came vnto the place called Golgotha, (that is to say, the place of dead mens skulles) 
\v 34 They gaue him vineger to drinke, mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drinke. 
\v 35 And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, and did cast lottes, that it might be fulfilled, which was spoken by the Prophet, They deuided my garments among them, and vpon my vesture did cast lottes. 
\v 36 And they sate, and watched him there. 
\v 37 They set vp also ouer his head his cause written, THIS IS IESVS THE KING OF THE IEVVES. 
\v 38 And there were two theeues crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left. 
\v 39 And they that passed by, reuiled him, wagging their heades, 
\v 40 And saying, Thou that destroyest ye Temple, and buildest it in three dayes, saue thy selfe: if thou be ye Sonne of God, come downe from ye crosse. 
\v 41 Likewise also the hie Priests mocking him, with the Scribes, and Elders, and Pharises, said, 
\v 42 He saued others, but he cannot saue him selfe: if he be ye King of Israel, let him now come downe from ye crosse, and we will beleeue in him. 
\v 43 He trusted in God, let him deliuer him nowe, if he will haue him: for he saide, I am the Sonne of God. 
\v 44 The selfe same thing also ye theeues which were crucified with him, cast in his teeth. 
\v 45 Now from ye sixt houre was there darkenesse ouer all the land, vnto the ninth houre. 
\v 46 And about ye ninth houre Iesus cryed with a loud voyce, saying, Eli, Eli, lamasabachthani? that is, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? 
\v 47 And some of them that stoode there, when they heard it, said, This man calleth Elias. 
\v 48 And straightway one of them ran, and tooke a spondge, and filled it with vineger, and put it on a reede, and gaue him to drinke. 
\v 49 Other said, Let be: let vs see, if Elias wil come and saue him. 
\v 50 Then Iesus cryed againe with a loude voyce, and yeelded vp the ghost. 
\v 51 And behold, the vayle of the Temple was rent in twaine, from the top to the bottome, and the earth did quake, and the stones were cloue. 
\v 52 And the graues did open themselues, and many bodies of the Saintes, which slept, arose, 
\v 53 And came out of the graues after his resurrection, and went into the holy citie, and appeared vnto many. 
\v 54 When the Centurion, and they that were with him watching Iesus, saw the earthquake, and the thinges that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truely this was the Sonne of God. 
\v 55 And many women were there, beholding him a farre off, which had folowed Iesus from Galile, ministring vnto him. 
\v 56 Among whom was Marie Magdalene, and Marie the mother of Iames, and Ioses, and the mother of Zebedeus sonnes. 
\v 57 And when the euen was come, there came a riche man of Arimathea, named Ioseph, who had also himselfe bene Iesus disciple. 
\v 58 He went to Pilate, and asked ye body of Iesus. Then Pilate commanded ye body to be deliuered. 
\v 59 So Ioseph tooke the body, and wrapped it in a cleane linnen cloth, 
\v 60 And put it in his new tombe, which he had hewen out in a rocke, and rolled a great stone to the doore of the sepulchre, and departed. 
\v 61 And there was Marie Magdalene, and the other Marie sitting ouer against the sepulchre. 
\v 62 Nowe the next day that followed the Preparation of the Sabbath, the hie Priestes and Pharises assembled to Pilate, 
\v 63 And said, Syr, we remember that that deceiuer saide, while he was yet aliue, Within three dayes I will rise. 
\v 64 Command therefore, that the sepulchre be made sure vntill the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steale him away, and say vnto the people, He is risen from the dead: so shall the last errour be worse then the first. 
\v 65 Then Pilate saide vnto them, Ye haue a watch: goe, and make it sure as ye knowe. 
\v 66 And they went, and made the sepulchre sure with the watch, and sealed the stone. 
\c 28  
\p
\v 1 Now in the end of the Sabbath, when the first day of ye weeke began to dawne, Marie Magdalene, and the other Marie came to see the sepulchre, 
\v 2 And behold, there was a great earthquake: for the Angel of the Lord descended from heauen, and came and rolled backe the stone from the doore, and sate vpon it. 
\v 3 And his countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snowe. 
\v 4 And for feare of him, the keepers were astonied, and became as dead men. 
\v 5 But the Angel answered, and said to the women, Feare ye not: for I know that ye seeke Iesus which was crucified: 
\v 6 He is not here, for he is risen; as he saide: come, see the place where the Lord was laid, 
\v 7 And go quickly, and tel his disciples that he is risen from ye dead: and behold, he goeth before you into Galile: there ye shall see him: loe, I haue told you. 
\v 8 So they departed quickly from the sepulchre, with feare and great ioye, and did runne to bring his disciples worde. 
\v 9 And as they wet to tel his disciples, behold, Iesus also met the, saying, God saue you. And they came, and tooke him by the feete, and worshipped him. 
\v 10 Then said Iesus vnto them, Be not afraide. Goe, and tell my brethren, that they goe into Galile, and there shall they see me. 
\v 11 Nowe when they were gone, beholde, some of the watch came into the citie, and shewed vnto the hie Priestes all ye things that were done. 
\v 12 And they gathered them together with the Elders, and tooke counsell, and gaue large money vnto the souldiers, 
\v 13 Saying, Say, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept. 
\v 14 And if this matter come before the gouernour to be heard, we will perswade him, and so vse the matter that you shall not neede to care. 
\v 15 So they tooke the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is noysed among the Iewes vnto this day. 
\v 16 Then ye eleuen disciples wet into Galile, into a mountaine, where Iesus had appointed the. 
\v 17 And when they sawe him, they worshipped him: but some douted. 
\v 18 And Iesus came, and spake vnto them, saying, All power is giuen vnto me, in heauen, and in earth. 
\v 19 Go therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and the Sonne, and the holy Ghost, 
\v 20 Teaching them to obserue all things, whatsoeuer I haue commanded you: and lo, I am with you alway, vntill the ende of the worlde, Amen.
