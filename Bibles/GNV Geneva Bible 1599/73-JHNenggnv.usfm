\mt1 THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST. JOHN 
\c 1  
\p
\v 1 In the beginning was that Word, and that Word was with God, and that Word was God. 
\v 2 This same was in the beginning with God. 
\v 3 All things were made by it, and without it was made nothing that was made. 
\v 4 In it was life, and that life was the light of men. 
\v 5 And that light shineth in the darkenesse, and the darkenesse comprehended it not. 
\v 6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was Iohn. 
\v 7 This same came for a witnesse, to beare witnesse of that light, that all men through him might beleeue. 
\v 8 He was not that light, but was sent to beare witnesse of that light. 
\v 9 This was that true light, which lighteth euery man that commeth into the world. 
\v 10 He was in the world, and the worlde was made by him: and the worlde knewe him not. 
\v 11 He came vnto his owne, and his owne receiued him not. 
\v 12 But as many as receiued him, to them he gaue prerogatiue to be the sonnes of God, euen to them that beleeue in his Name. 
\v 13 Which are borne not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of ye wil of man, but of God. 
\v 14 And that Word was made flesh, and dwelt among vs, (and we sawe the glorie thereof, as the glorie of the onely begotten Sonne of the Father) full of grace and trueth. 
\v 15 Iohn bare witnesse of him, and cryed, saying, This was he of whom I said, He that commeth after me, was before me: for he was better then I. 
\v 16 And of his fulnesse haue all we receiued, and grace for grace. 
\v 17 For the Lawe was giuen by Moses, but grace, and trueth came by Iesus Christ. 
\v 18 No man hath seene God at any time: that onely begotten Sonne, which is in the bosome of the Father, he hath declared him. 
\v 19 Then this is the record of Iohn, when the Iewes sent Priestes and Leuites from Hierusalem, to aske him, Who art thou? 
\v 20 And he confessed and denied not, and said plainely, I am not that Christ. 
\v 21 And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he said, I am not. Art thou that Prophet? And he answered, No. 
\v 22 Then said they vnto him, Who art thou, that we may giue an answere to them that sent vs? What sayest thou of thy selfe? 
\v 23 He said, I am the voyce of him that cryeth in the wildernesse, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the Prophet Esaias. 
\v 24 Nowe they which were sent, were of the Pharises. 
\v 25 And they asked him, and saide vnto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, neither Elias, nor that Prophet? 
\v 26 Iohn answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there is one among you, whom ye knowe not. 
\v 27 He it is that commeth after me, which was before me, whose shoe latchet I am not worthie to vnloose. 
\v 28 These things were done in Bethabara beyond Iordan, where Iohn did baptize. 
\v 29 The next day Iohn, seeth Iesus comming vnto him, and saith, Beholde that Lambe of God, which taketh away the sinne of the world. 
\v 30 This is he of whom I saide, After me commeth a man, which was before me: for he was better then I. 
\v 31 And I knewe him not: but because he should be declared to Israel, therefore am I come, baptizing with water. 
\v 32 So Iohn bare recorde, saying, I behelde that Spirit come downe from heauen, like a doue, and it abode vpon him, 
\v 33 And I knewe him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, he saide vnto me, Vpon whom thou shalt see that Spirit come downe, and tary still on him, that is he which baptizeth with the holy Ghost. 
\v 34 And I sawe, and bare record that this is that Sonne of God. 
\v 35 The next day, Iohn stoode againe, and two of his disciples. 
\v 36 And he behelde Iesus walking by, and said, Beholde that Lambe of God. 
\v 37 And the two disciples heard him speake, and followed Iesus. 
\v 38 Then Iesus turned about, and saw them follow, and saide vnto them, What seeke ye? And they saide vnto him, Rabbi (which is to say by interpretation, Master) where dwellest thou? 
\v 39 He saide vnto them, Come, and see. They came and sawe where hee dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth houre. 
\v 40 Andrew, Simon Peters brother, was one of the two which had heard it of Iohn, and that followed him. 
\v 41 The same founde his brother Simon first, and said vnto him, We haue founde that Messias, which is by interpretation, that Christ. 
\v 42 And he brought him to Iesus. And Iesus behelde him, and saide, Thou art Simon the sonne of Iona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, a stone. 
\v 43 The day following, Iesus woulde goe into Galile, and founde Philip, and said vnto him, Followe me. 
\v 44 Nowe Philip was of Bethsaida, the citie of Andrew and Peter. 
\v 45 Philippe founde Nathanael, and saide vnto him, Wee haue founde him of whom Moses did write in the Lawe, and the Prophetes, Iesus that sonne of Ioseph, that was of Nazareth. 
\v 46 Then Nathanael sayde vnto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saide to him, Come, and see. 
\v 47 Iesus sawe Nathanael comming to him, and saide of him, Beholde in deede an Israelite, in whom is no guile. 
\v 48 Nathanael sayde vnto him, Whence knewest thou mee? Iesus answered, and sayd vnto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast vnder the figge tree, I sawe thee. 
\v 49 Nathanael answered, and saide vnto him, Rabbi, thou art that Sonne of God: thou art that King of Israel. 
\v 50 Iesus answered, and sayde vnto him, Because I sayde vnto thee, I sawe thee vnder the figtree, beleeuest thou? thou shalt see greater things then these. 
\v 51 And he saide vnto him, Verely, verely I say vnto you, hereafter shall yee see heauen open, and the Angels of God ascending, and descending vpon that Sonne of man.

\p
\v 1 And the thirde day, was there a mariage in Cana a towne of Galile, and the mother of Iesus was there. 
\v 2 And Iesus was called also, and his disciples vnto the mariage. 
\v 3 Nowe when the wine failed, the mother of Iesus saide vnto him, They haue no wine. 
\v 4 Iesus saide vnto her, Woman, what haue I to doe with thee? mine houre is not yet come. 
\v 5 His mother saide vnto the seruants, Whatsoeuer he sayeth vnto you, doe it. 
\v 6 And there were set there, sixe waterpots of stone, after the maner of the purifying of the Iewes, conteining two or three firkins a piece. 
\v 7 And Iesus sayde vnto them, Fill the waterpots with water. Then they filled them vp to the brim. 
\v 8 Then he sayde vnto them, Draw out nowe and beare vnto the gouernour of the feast. So they bare it. 
\v 9 Nowe when the gouernour of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, (for he knewe not whence it was: but the seruants, which drewe the water, knewe) the gouernour of ye feast called the bridegrome, 
\v 10 And saide vnto him, All men at the beginning set foorth good wine, and when men haue well drunke, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept backe the good wine vntill nowe. 
\v 11 This beginning of miracles did Iesus in Cana a towne of Galile, and shewed forth his glorie: and his disciples beleeued on him. 
\v 12 After that, he went downe into Capernaum, he and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: but they continued not many daies there. 
\v 13 For the Iewes Passeouer was at hande. Therefore Iesus went vp to Hierusalem. 
\v 14 And he found in the Temple those that sold oxen, and sheepe, and doues, and changers of money, sitting there. 
\v 15 Then hee made a scourge of small cordes, and draue them all out of the Temple with the sheepe and oxen, and powred out the changers money, and ouerthrewe the tables, 
\v 16 And said vnto them that solde doues, Take these things hence: make not my fathers house, an house of marchandise. 
\v 17 And his disciples remembred, that it was written, The zeale of thine house hath eaten me vp. 
\v 18 Then answered the Iewes, and saide vnto him, What signe shewest thou vnto vs, that thou doest these things? 
\v 19 Iesus answered, and said vnto them, Destroy this Temple, and in three daies I will raise it vp againe. 
\v 20 Then said the Iewes, Fourtie and sixe yeeres was this Temple a building, and wilt thou reare it vp in three daies? 
\v 21 But he spake of the temple of his bodie. 
\v 22 Assoone therefore as he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembred that hee thus sayde vnto them: and they beleeued the Scripture, and the worde which Iesus had saide. 
\v 23 Nowe when hee was at Hierusalem at the Passeouer in the feast, many beleeued in his Name, when they sawe his miracles which he did. 
\v 24 But Iesus did not commit him selfe vnto them, because he knewe them all, 
\v 25 And had no neede that any should testifie of man: for he knewe what was in man. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 There was nowe a man of the Pharises, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Iewes. 
\v 2 This man came to Iesus by night, and sayd vnto him, Rabbi, we knowe ye thou art a teacher come from God: for no man could do these miracles that thou doest, except God were with him. 
\v 3 Iesus answered, and said vnto him, Verely, verely I say vnto thee, except a man be borne againe, he can not see the kingdome of God. 
\v 4 Nicodemus sayde vnto him, Howe can a man be borne which is olde? can he enter into his mothers wombe againe, and be borne? 
\v 5 Iesus answered, Verely, verely I say vnto thee, except that a man be borne of water and of the Spirite, hee can not enter into the kingdome of God. 
\v 6 That which is borne of the flesh, is flesh: and that that is borne of the Spirit, is spirit. 
\v 7 Marueile not that I said to thee, Yee must be borne againe. 
\v 8 The winde bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it commeth, and whither it goeth: so is euery man that is borne of the Spirit. 
\v 9 Nicodemus answered, and said vnto him, Howe can these things be? 
\v 10 Iesus answered, and saide vnto him, Art thou a teacher of Israel, and knowest not these things? 
\v 11 Verely, verely I say vnto thee, wee speake that we know, and testifie that we haue seene: but yee receiue not our witnesse. 
\v 12 If when I tel you earthly things, ye beleeue not, howe should yee beleeue, if I shall tel you of heauenly things? 
\v 13 For no man ascendeth vp to heauen, but he that hath descended from heauen, that Sonne of man which is in heauen. 
\v 14 And as Moses lift vp the serpent in the wildernesse, so must that Sonne of man be lift vp, 
\v 15 That whosoeuer beleeueth in him, shoulde not perish, but haue eternall life. 
\v 16 For God so loued the worlde, that hee hath giuen his onely begotten Sonne, that whosoeuer beleeueth in him, should not perish, but haue euerlasting life. 
\v 17 For God sent not his Sonne into the world, that he should condemne the world, but that the world through him might be saued. 
\v 18 Hee that beleeueth in him, is not condemned: but hee that beleeueth not, is condemned already, because he hath not beleeued in the Name of that onely begotten Sonne of God. 
\v 19 And this is the condemnation, that that light came into the worlde, and men loued darknesse rather then that light, because their deedes were euill. 
\v 20 For euery man that euill doeth, hateth the light, neither commeth to light, least his deedes should be reprooued. 
\v 21 But he that doeth trueth, commeth to the light, that his deedes might bee made manifest, that they are wrought according to God. 
\v 22 After these things, came Iesus and his disciples into the lande of Iudea, and there taried with them, and baptized. 
\v 23 And Iohn also baptized in Enon besides Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized. 
\v 24 For Iohn was not yet cast into prison. 
\v 25 Then there arose a question betweene Iohns disciples and the Iewes, about purifying. 
\v 26 And they came vnto Iohn, and saide vnto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Iorden, to whom thou barest witnesse, behold, he baptizeth, and all men come to him. 
\v 27 Iohn answered, and saide, A man can receiue nothing, except it be giuen him from heauen. 
\v 28 Yee your selues are my witnesses, that I sayde, I am not that Christ, but that I am sent before him. 
\v 29 He that hath the bride, is the bridegrome: but the friend of the bridegrome which standeth and heareth him, reioyceth greatly, because of the bridegromes voyce. This my ioy therefore is fulfilled. 
\v 30 He must increase, but I must decrease. 
\v 31 Hee that is come from an hie, is aboue all: he that is of the earth, is of the earth, and speaketh of the earth: hee that is come from heauen, is aboue all. 
\v 32 And what hee hath seene and heard, that he testifieth: but no man receiueth his testimonie. 
\v 33 He that hath receiued his testimonie, hath sealed that God is true. 
\v 34 For hee whome God hath sent, speaketh the woordes of God: for God giueth him not the Spirit by measure. 
\v 35 The Father loueth the Sonne, and hath giuen all things into his hande. 
\v 36 Hee that beleeueth in the Sonne, hath euerlasting life, and hee that obeyeth not the Sonne, shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 Nowe when the Lord knew, how the Pharises had heard, that Iesus made and baptized moe disciples then Iohn, 
\v 2 (Though Iesus himselfe baptized not: but his disciples) 
\v 3 Hee left Iudea, and departed againe into Galile. 
\v 4 And he must needes goe through Samaria. 
\v 5 Then came hee to a citie of Samaria called Sychar, neere vnto the possession that Iacob gaue to his sonne Ioseph. 
\v 6 And there was Iacobs well. Iesus then wearied in the iourney, sate thus on the well: it was about the sixt houre. 
\v 7 There came a woman of Samaria to drawe water. Iesus sayd vnto her, Giue me drinke. 
\v 8 For his disciples were gone away into the citie, to buy meate. 
\v 9 Then sayde the woman of Samaria vnto him, Howe is it, that thou being a Iewe, askest drinke of me, which am a woman of Samaria? For the Iewes meddle not with the Samaritans. 
\v 10 Iesus answered and saide vnto her, If thou knewest that gift of God, and who it is that saieth to thee, Giue mee drinke, thou wouldest haue asked of him, and hee woulde haue giuen thee, water of life. 
\v 11 The woman saide vnto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to drawe with, and the well is deepe: from whence then hast thou that water of life? 
\v 12 Art thou greater then our father Iacob, which gaue vs the well, and hee himselfe dranke thereof, and his sonnes, and his cattell? 
\v 13 Iesus answered, and said vnto her, Whosoeuer drinketh of this water, shall thirst againe: 
\v 14 But whosoeuer drinketh of the water that I shall giue him, shall neuer be more a thirst: but the water that I shall giue him, shalbe in him a well of water, springing vp into euerlasting life. 
\v 15 The woman said vnto him, Syr, giue me of that water, that I may not thirst, neither come hither to drawe. 
\v 16 Iesus said vnto her, Go, call thine husband, and come hither. 
\v 17 The woman answered, and saide, I haue no husband. Iesus said vnto her, Thou hast well said, I haue no husband. 
\v 18 For thou hast had fiue husbands, and he whom thou nowe hast, is not thine husband: that saidest thou truely. 
\v 19 The woman saide vnto him, Sir, I see that thou art a Prophet. 
\v 20 Our fathers worshipped in this mountaine, and ye say, that in Ierusalem is the place where men ought to worship. 
\v 21 Iesus saide vnto her, Woman, beleeue me, the houre commeth, when ye shall neither in this mountaine, nor at Hierusalem worship ye Father. 
\v 22 Ye worship that which ye knowe not: we worship that which we knowe: for saluation is of the Iewes. 
\v 23 But the houre commeth, and nowe is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit, and trueth: for the Father requireth euen such to worship him. 
\v 24 God is a Spirite, and they that worship him, must worship him in spirit and trueth. 
\v 25 The woman said vnto him, I knowe well that Messias shall come which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell vs all things. 
\v 26 Iesus said vnto her, I am he, that speake vnto thee. 
\v 27 And vpon that, came his disciples, and marueiled that he talked with a woman: yet no man said vnto him, What askest thou? or why talkest thou with her? 
\v 28 The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the citie, and said to the men, 
\v 29 Come, see a man which hath tolde me all things that euer I did: is not he that Christ? 
\v 30 Then they went out of the citie, and came vnto him. 
\v 31 In the meane while, the disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eate. 
\v 32 But he said vnto them, I haue meate to eate that ye know not of. 
\v 33 Then said ye disciples betweene themselues, Hath any man brought him meate? 
\v 34 Iesus saide vnto them, My meate is that I may doe the will of him that sent me, and finish his worke. 
\v 35 Say not ye, There are yet foure moneths, and then commeth haruest? Beholde, I say vnto you, Lift vp your eyes, and looke on the regions: for they are white alreadie vnto haruest. 
\v 36 And he that reapeth, receiueth rewarde, and gathereth fruite vnto life eternall, that both he that soweth, and he that reapeth, might reioyce together. 
\v 37 For herein is the saying true, that one soweth, and an other reapeth. 
\v 38 I sent you to reape that, whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entred into their labours. 
\v 39 Nowe many of the Samaritans of that citie beleeued in him, for the saying of the woman which testified, He hath tolde me all things that euer I did. 
\v 40 Then when the Samaritans were come vnto him, they besought him, that he woulde tarie with them: and he abode there two dayes. 
\v 41 And many moe beleeued because of his owne word. 
\v 42 And they said vnto the woman, Nowe we beleeue, not because of thy saying: for we haue heard him our selues, and knowe that this is in deede that Christ the Sauiour of the world. 
\v 43 So two dayes after he departed thence, and went into Galile. 
\v 44 For Iesus himselfe had testified, that a Prophet hath none honour in his owne countrey. 
\v 45 Then when he was come into Galile, the Galileans receiued him, which had seene all the things that he did at Hierusalem at the feast: for they went also vnto the feast. 
\v 46 And Iesus came againe into Cana a towne of Galile, where he had made of water, wine. And there was a certaine ruler, whose sonne was sicke at Capernaum. 
\v 47 When he heard that Iesus was come out of Iudea into Galile, he went vnto him, and besought him that he would goe downe, and heale his sonne: for he was euen ready to die. 
\v 48 Then saide Iesus vnto him, Except ye see signes and wonders, ye will not beleeue. 
\v 49 The ruler said vnto him, Syr, goe downe before my sonne dye. 
\v 50 Iesus said vnto him, Go thy way, thy sonne liueth: and the man beleeued the worde that Iesus had spoken vnto him, and went his way. 
\v 51 And as he was nowe going downe, his seruants met him, saying, Thy sonne liueth. 
\v 52 Then enquired he of them the houre when he began to amend. And they said vnto him, Yesterday the seuenth houre the feuer left him. 
\v 53 Then the father knew, that it was the same houre in the which Iesus had said vnto him, Thy sonne liueth. And he beleeued, and all his houshold. 
\v 54 This second miracle did Iesus againe, after he was come out of Iudea into Galile. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 After that, there was a feast of the Iewes, and Iesus went vp to Hierusalem. 
\v 2 And there is at Hierusalem by the place of the sheepe, a poole called in Ebrew Bethesda, hauing fiue porches: 
\v 3 In the which lay a great multitude of sicke folke, of blinde, halte, and withered, wayting for the mouing of the water. 
\v 4 For an Angel went downe at a certaine season into the poole, and troubled the water: whosoeuer then first, after the stirring of the water, stepped in, was made whole of whatsoeuer disease he had. 
\v 5 And a certaine man was there, which had bene diseased eight and thirtie yeeres. 
\v 6 When Iesus sawe him lie, and knew that he nowe long time had bene diseased, he saide vnto him, Wilt thou be made whole? 
\v 7 The sicke man answered him, Sir, I haue no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the poole: but while I am comming, another steppeth downe before me. 
\v 8 Iesus said vnto him, Rise: take vp thy bed, and walke. 
\v 9 And immediatly the man was made whole, and tooke vp his bed, and walked: and the same day was the Sabbath. 
\v 10 The Iewes therefore said to him that was made whole, It is the Sabbath day: it is not lawfull for thee to cary thy bed. 
\v 11 He answered them, He that made me whole, he said vnto me, Take vp thy bed, and walke. 
\v 12 Then asked they him, What man is that which said vnto thee, Take vp thy bed and walke? 
\v 13 And he that was healed, knewe not who it was: for Iesus had conueied himselfe away from the multitude that was in that place. 
\v 14 And after that, Iesus founde him in the Temple, and said vnto him, Beholde, thou art made whole: sinne no more, lest a worse thing come vnto thee. 
\v 15 The man departed and tolde the Iewes that it was Iesus, which had made him whole. 
\v 16 And therefore the Iewes did persecute Iesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the Sabbath day. 
\v 17 But Iesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I worke. 
\v 18 Therefore the Iewes sought the more to kill him: not onely because he had broken the Sabbath: but said also that God was his Father, and made himselfe equall with God. 
\v 19 Then answered Iesus, and said vnto them, Verely, verely I say vnto you, The Sonne can doe nothing of himselfe, saue that he seeth the Father doe: for whatsoeuer things he doth, the same things doeth the Sonne in like maner. 
\v 20 For the Father loueth the Sonne, and sheweth him all things, whatsoeuer he himselfe doeth, and he will shewe him greater workes then these, that ye should marueile. 
\v 21 For likewise as the Father rayseth vp the dead, and quickeneth them, so the Sonne quickeneth whom he will. 
\v 22 For the Father iudgeth no man, but hath committed all iudgement vnto the Sonne, 
\v 23 Because that all men shoulde honour the Sonne, as they honour the Father: he that honoureth not the Sonne, the same honoureth not the Father, which hath sent him. 
\v 24 Verely, verely I say vnto you, he that heareth my worde, and beleeueth him that sent me, hath euerlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation, but hath passed from death vnto life. 
\v 25 Verely, verely I say vnto you, the houre shall come, and now is, when the dead shall heare the voyce of the Sonne of God: and they that heare it, shall liue. 
\v 26 For as the Father hath life in himselfe, so likewise hath he giuen to the Sonne to haue life in himselfe, 
\v 27 And hath giuen him power also to execute iudgement, in that he is the Sonne of man. 
\v 28 Marueile not at this: for the houre shall come, in the which all that are in the graues, shall heare his voyce. 
\v 29 And they shall come foorth, that haue done good, vnto ye resurrection of life: but they that haue done euil, vnto the resurrection of condemnation. 
\v 30 I can doe nothing of mine owne selfe: as I heare, I iudge: and my iudgement is iust, because I seeke not mine owne will, but the will of the Father who hath sent me. 
\v 31 If I should beare witnesse of my selfe, my witnesse were not true. 
\v 32 There is another that beareth witnesse of me, and I know that the witnesse, which he beareth of me, is true. 
\v 33 Ye sent vnto Iohn, and he bare witnesse vnto the trueth. 
\v 34 But I receiue not the record of man: neuerthelesse these things I say, that ye might be saued. 
\v 35 He was a burning, and a shining candle: and ye would for a season haue reioyced in his light. 
\v 36 But I haue greater witnesse then the witnesse of Iohn: for the workes which the Father hath giuen me to finish, the same workes that I doe, beare witnesse of me, that the Father sent me. 
\v 37 And the Father himselfe, which hath sent me, beareth witnesse of me. Ye haue not heard his voyce at any time, neither haue ye seene his shape. 
\v 38 And his worde haue you not abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye beleeued not. 
\v 39 Searche the Scriptures: for in them ye thinke to haue eternall life, and they are they which testifie of me. 
\v 40 But ye will not come to me, that ye might haue life. 
\v 41 I receiue not the prayse of men. 
\v 42 But I know you, that ye haue not the loue of God in you. 
\v 43 I am come in my Fathers Name, and ye receiue me not: if another shall come in his owne name, him will ye receiue. 
\v 44 How can ye beleeue, which receiue honour one of another, and seeke not the honour that commeth of God alone? 
\v 45 Doe not thinke that I will accuse you to my Father: there is one that accuseth you, euen Moses, in whom ye trust. 
\v 46 For had ye beleeued Moses, ye would haue beleeued me: for he wrote of me. 
\v 47 But if ye beleeue not his writings, how shall ye beleeue my wordes? 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1 After these thinges, Iesus went his way ouer the sea of Galile, which is Tiberias. 
\v 2 And a great multitude followed him, because they sawe his miracles, which hee did on them that were diseased. 
\v 3 Then Iesus went vp into a mountaine, and there he sate with his disciples. 
\v 4 Now the Passeouer, a feast of the Iewes, was neere. 
\v 5 Then Iesus lift vp his eyes, and seeing that a great multitude came vnto him, hee sayde vnto Philippe, Whence shall we buy breade, that these might eate? 
\v 6 (And this he sayde to prooue him: for hee himselfe knewe what he would doe.) 
\v 7 Philippe answered him, Two hundreth penie worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that euery one of them may take a litle. 
\v 8 Then saide vnto him one of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peters brother, 
\v 9 There is a little boy heere, which hath fiue barlie loaues, and two fishes: but what are they among so many? 
\v 10 And Iesus saide, Make ye people sit downe. (Nowe there was much grasse in that place.) Then the men sate downe in nomber, about fiue thousande. 
\v 11 And Iesus tooke the bread, and gaue thanks, and gaue to the disciples, and the disciples, to them that were set downe: and likewise of the fishes as much as they would. 
\v 12 And when they were satisfied, he said vnto his disciples, Gather vp the broken meat which remaineth, that nothing be lost. 
\v 13 Then they gathered it together, and filled twelue baskets with the broken meat of the fiue barly loaues, which remained vnto them that had eaten. 
\v 14 Then the men, when they had seene the miracle that Iesus did, saide, This is of a trueth that Prophet that should come into the world. 
\v 15 When Iesus therfore perceiued that they would come, and take him to make him a King, hee departed againe into a mountaine himselfe alone. 
\v 16 When euen was nowe come, his disciples went downe vnto the sea, 
\v 17 And entred into a shippe, and went ouer the sea, towardes Capernaum: and nowe it was darke, and Iesus was not come to them. 
\v 18 And the Sea arose with a great winde that blewe. 
\v 19 And when they had rowed about fiue and twentie, or thirtie furlongs, they sawe Iesus walking on the sea, and drawing neere vnto the ship: so they were afraide. 
\v 20 But he said vnto them, It is I: be not afraid. 
\v 21 Then willingly they receiued him into the ship, and the ship was by and by at the lande, whither they went. 
\v 22 The day following, the people which stoode on the other side of the sea, saw that there was none other ship there, saue that one, whereinto his disciples were entred, and that Iesus went not with his disciples in the ship, but that his disciples were gone alone, 
\v 23 And that there came other ships from Tiberias neere vnto the place where they ate the bread, after the Lord had giuen thankes. 
\v 24 Nowe when the people sawe that Iesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also tooke shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Iesus. 
\v 25 And when they had founde him on the other side of the sea, they sayde vnto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither? 
\v 26 Iesus answered them; and sayde, Verely, verely I say vnto you, ye seeke me not because ye sawe the miracles, but because yee ate of ye loaues, and were filled. 
\v 27 Labour not for ye meate which perisheth, but for the meate that endureth vnto euerlasting life, which the Sonne of man shall giue vnto you: for him hath God the Father sealed. 
\v 28 Then sayde they vnto him, What shall we doe, that we might worke the workes of God? 
\v 29 Iesus answered, and sayde vnto them, This is the woorke of God, that yee beleeue in him, whome he hath sent. 
\v 30 They sayde therefore vnto him, What signe shewest thou then, that we may see it, and beleeue thee? what doest thou woorke? 
\v 31 Our fathers did eate Manna in the desart, as it is written, Hee gaue them bread from heauen to eate. 
\v 32 Then Iesus said vnto them, Verely, verely I say vnto you, Moses gaue you not that bread from heauen, but my Father giueth you that true bread from heauen. 
\v 33 For the breade of God is hee which commeth downe from heauen, and giueth life vnto the world. 
\v 34 Then they said vnto him, Lord, euermore giue vs this bread. 
\v 35 And Iesus saide vnto them, I am that bread of life: he that commeth to me, shall not hunger, and he that beleeueth in me, shall neuer thirst. 
\v 36 But I said vnto you, that ye also haue seene me, and beleeue not. 
\v 37 All that the Father giueth me, shall come to mee: and him that commeth to me, I cast not away. 
\v 38 For I came downe from heauen, not to do mine owne wil, but his wil which hath sent me. 
\v 39 And this is the Fathers will which hath sent mee, that of all which hee hath giuen mee, I should lose nothing, but shoulde raise it vp againe at the last day. 
\v 40 And this is the will of him that sent mee, that euery man which seeth the Sonne, and beleeueth in him, should haue euerlasting life: and I will raise him vp at the last day. 
\v 41 The Iewes then murmured at him because hee sayde, I am that bread, which is come downe from heauen. 
\v 42 And they said, Is not this Iesus that sonne of Ioseph, whose father and mother wee knowe? howe then sayth he, I came downe from heauen? 
\v 43 Iesus then answered, and saide vnto them, Murmure not among your selues. 
\v 44 No man can come to mee, except the Father, which hath sent mee, drawe him: and I will raise him vp at the last day. 
\v 45 It is written in the Prophetes, And they shalbe al taught of God. Euery man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, commeth vnto me: 
\v 46 Not that any man hath seene the Father, saue hee which is of God, hee hath seene the Father. 
\v 47 Verely, verely I say vnto you, hee that beleeueth in me, hath euerlasting life. 
\v 48 I am that bread of life. 
\v 49 Your fathers did eate Manna in the wildernesse, and are dead. 
\v 50 This is that breade, which commeth downe from heauen, that hee which eateth of it, shoulde not die. 
\v 51 I am that liuing breade, which came downe from heauen: if any man eate of this breade, hee shall liue for euer: and the bread that I will giue, is my flesh, which I will giue for the life of the world. 
\v 52 Then the Iewes stroue among themselues, saying, Howe can this man giue vs his flesh to eate? 
\v 53 Then Iesus saide vnto them, Verely, verely I say vnto you, Except yee eate the flesh of the Sonne of man, and drinke his blood, yee haue no life in you. 
\v 54 Whosoeuer eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternall life, and I will raise him vp at the last day. 
\v 55 For my flesh is meat in deede, and my blood is drinke in deede. 
\v 56 Hee that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him. 
\v 57 As that liuing Father hath sent me, so liue I by the Father, and he that eateth me, euen he shall liue by me. 
\v 58 This is that bread which came downe from heauen: not as your fathers haue eaten Manna, and are deade. Hee that eateth of this bread, shall liue for euer. 
\v 59 These things spake he in the Synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum. 
\v 60 Many therefore of his disciples (when they heard this) sayde, This is an hard saying: who can heare it? 
\v 61 But Iesus knowing in himselfe, that his disciples murmured at this, saide vnto them, Doeth this offend you? 
\v 62 What then if yee should see that Sonne of man ascend vp where he was before? 
\v 63 It is the spirite that quickeneth: the flesh profiteth nothing: the woordes that I speake vnto you, are spirite and life. 
\v 64 But there are some of you that beleeue not: for Iesus knewe from the beginning, which they were that beleeued not, and who shoulde betray him. 
\v 65 And hee saide, Therefore saide I vnto you, that no man can come vnto mee, except it be giuen vnto him of my Father. 
\v 66 From that time, many of his disciples went backe, and walked no more with him. 
\v 67 Then sayde Iesus to the twelue, Will yee also goe away? 
\v 68 Then Simon Peter answered him, Master, to whome shall we goe? thou hast the wordes of eternall life: 
\v 69 And we beleeue and knowe that thou art that Christ that Sonne of the liuing God. 
\v 70 Iesus answered them, Haue not I chosen you twelue, and one of you is a deuill? 
\v 71 Now he spake it of Iudas Iscariot the sonne of Simon: for hee it was that shoulde betraie him, though he was one of the twelue. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1 After these things, Iesus walked in Galile, and woulde not walke in Iudea: for the Iewes sought to kill him. 
\v 2 Nowe the Iewes feast of the Tabernacles was at hande. 
\v 3 His brethren therefore sayde vnto him, Depart hence, and goe into Iudea, that thy disciples may see thy woorkes that thou doest. 
\v 4 For there is no man that doeth any thing secretely, and hee himselfe seeketh to be famous. If thou doest these things, shewe thy selfe to the worlde. 
\v 5 For as yet his brethren beleeued not in him. 
\v 6 Then Iesus saide vnto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway readie. 
\v 7 The world can not hate you: but me it hateth, because I testifie of it, that the workes thereof are euill. 
\v 8 Go ye vp vnto this feast: I wil not go vp yet vnto this feast: for my time is not yet fulfilled. 
\v 9 These things he sayde vnto them, and abode still in Galile. 
\v 10 But assoone as his brethren were gone vp, then went hee also vp vnto the feast, not openly, but as it were priuilie. 
\v 11 Then the Iewes sought him at the feast, and saide, Where is hee? 
\v 12 And much murmuring was there of him among the people. Some said, He is a good man: other sayd, Nay: but he deceiueth the people. 
\v 13 Howbeit no man spake openly of him for feare of the Iewes. 
\v 14 Nowe when halfe the feast was done, Iesus went vp into the Temple and taught. 
\v 15 And the Iewes marueiled, saving, Howe knoweth this man the Scriptures, seeing that hee neuer learned! 
\v 16 Iesus answered them, and saide, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. 
\v 17 If any man will doe his will, he shall knowe of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speake of my selfe. 
\v 18 Hee that speaketh of himselfe, seeketh his owne glorie: but hee that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no vnrighteousnes is in him. 
\v 19 Did not Moses giue you a Law, and yet none of you keepeth the lawe? Why goe ye about to kill me? 
\v 20 The people answered, and said, Thou hast a deuil: who goeth about to kill thee? 
\v 21 Iesus answered, and saide to them, I haue done one worke, and ye all maruaile. 
\v 22 Moses therefore gaue vnto you circumcision, (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers) and ye on the Sabbath day circumcise a man. 
\v 23 If a man on the Sabbath receiue circumcision, that the Lawe of Moses should not be broken, be ye angrie with me, because I haue made a man euery whit whole on the Sabbath day? 
\v 24 Iudge not according to the appearance, but iudge righteous iudgement. 
\v 25 Then saide some of them of Hierusalem, Is not this he, whom they goe about to kill? 
\v 26 And beholde, he speaketh openly, and they say nothing to him: doe the rulers know in deede that this is in deede that Christ? 
\v 27 Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when that Christ commeth, no man shall knowe whence he is. 
\v 28 Then cried Iesus in the Temple as hee taught, saying, Ye both knowe mee, and knowe whence I am: yet am I not come of my selfe, but he that sent me, is true, whome ye knowe not. 
\v 29 But I knowe him: for I am of him, and he hath sent me. 
\v 30 Then they sought to take him, but no man layde handes on him, because his houre was not yet come. 
\v 31 Now many of the people beleeued in him, and said, When that Christ commeth, will he doe moe miracles then this man hath done? 
\v 32 The Pharises heard that the people murmured these thinges of him, and the Pharises, and high Priestes sent officers to take him. 
\v 33 Then saide Iesus vnto them, Yet am I a little while with you, and then goe I vnto him that sent mee. 
\v 34 Ye shall seeke me, and shall not finde me, and where I am, can ye not come. 
\v 35 Then saide the Iewes amongs themselues, Whither will he goe, that we shall not finde him? Will he goe vnto them that are dispersed among the Grecians, and teache the Grecians? 
\v 36 What saying is this that hee saide, Ye shall seeke mee, and shall not finde mee? and where I am, cannot ye come? 
\v 37 Nowe in the last and great day of the feast, Iesus stoode and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come vnto me, and drinke. 
\v 38 Hee that beleeueth in mee, as saith the Scripture, out of his bellie shall flowe riuers of water of life. 
\v 39 (This spake hee of the Spirite which they that beleeued in him, should receiue: for the holy Ghost was not yet giuen, because that Iesus was not yet glorified.) 
\v 40 So many of the people, when they heard this saying, said, Of a trueth this is that Prophet. 
\v 41 Other saide, This is that Christ: and some said, But shall that Christ come out of Galile? 
\v 42 Saith not the Scripture that that Christ shall come of the seede of Dauid, and out of the towne of Beth-leem, where Dauid was? 
\v 43 So was there dissension among the people for him. 
\v 44 And some of them would haue taken him, but no man layde handes on him. 
\v 45 Then came the officers to the hie Priests and Pharises, and they said vnto them, Why haue ye not brought him? 
\v 46 The officers answered, Neuer man spake like this man. 
\v 47 Then answered them the Pharises, Are yee also deceiued? 
\v 48 Doeth any of the rulers, or of the Pharises beleeue in him? 
\v 49 But this people, which know not the Law, are cursed. 
\v 50 Nicodemus said vnto them, (he that came to Iesus by night, and was one of them.) 
\v 51 Doth our Law iudge a man before it heare him, and knowe what he hath done? 
\v 52 They answered, and said vnto him, Art thou also of Galile? Searche and looke: for out of Galile ariseth no Prophet. 
\v 53 And euery man wet vnto his owne house. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1 And Iesus went vnto the mount of Oliues, 
\v 2 And early in the morning came againe into the Temple, and all the people came vnto him, and he sate downe, and taught them. 
\v 3 Then the Scribes, and the Pharises brought vnto him a woman, taken in adulterie, and set her in the middes, 
\v 4 And said vnto him, Master, we foud this woman committing adulterie, euen in the very acte. 
\v 5 Now Moses in our Law commanded, that such should be stoned: what sayest thou therefore? 
\v 6 And this they saide to tempt him, that they might haue, whereof to accuse him. But Iesus stouped downe, and with his finger wrote on the groud. 
\v 7 And while they continued asking him, hee lift himselfe vp, and sayde vnto them, Let him that is among you without sinne, cast the first stone at her. 
\v 8 And againe hee stouped downe, and wrote on the ground. 
\v 9 And when they heard it, being accused by their owne conscience, they went out one by one, beginning at ye eldest euen to the last: so Iesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the mids. 
\v 10 When Iesus had lift vp himselfe againe, and sawe no man, but the woman, hee saide vnto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee? 
\v 11 She said, No man, Lord. And Iesus said, Neither do I condemne thee: go and sinne no more. 
\v 12 Then spake Iesus againe vnto them, saying, I am that light of the worlde: hee that followeth mee, shall not walke in darkenes, but shall haue that light of life. 
\v 13 The Pharises therefore saide vnto him, Thou bearest recorde of thy selfe: thy recorde is not true. 
\v 14 Iesus answered, and sayde vnto them, Though I beare recorde of my selfe, yet my recorde is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go: but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I goe. 
\v 15 Ye iudge after the flesh: I iudge no man. 
\v 16 And if I also iudge, my iudgement is true: for I am not alone, but I, and the Father, that sent mee. 
\v 17 And it is also written in your Lawe, that the testimonie of two men is true. 
\v 18 I am one that beare witnes of my selfe, and the Father that sent me, beareth witnes of me. 
\v 19 Then saide they vnto him, Where is that Father of thine? Iesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor that Father of mine. If ye had knowen me, ye should haue knowen that Father of mine also. 
\v 20 These wordes spake Iesus in the treasurie, as hee taught in the Temple, and no man layde handes on him: for his houre was not yet come. 
\v 21 Then saide Iesus againe vnto them, I goe my way, and ye shall seeke me, and shall die in your sinnes, Whither I goe, can ye not come. 
\v 22 Then said the Iewes, Will he kill himselfe, because he saith, Whither I goe, can ye not come? 
\v 23 And hee saide vnto them, Ye are from beneath, I am from aboue: ye are of this world, I am not of this worlde. 
\v 24 I said therefore vnto you, That ye shall die in your sinnes: for except ye beleeue, that I am he, ye shall die in your sinnes. 
\v 25 Then saide they vnto him, Who art thou? And Iesus saide vnto them, Euen the same thing that I said vnto you from the beginning. 
\v 26 I haue many things to say, and to iudge of you: but he that sent me, is true, and the things that I haue heard of him, those speake I to the world. 
\v 27 They vnderstoode not that hee spake to them of the Father. 
\v 28 Then said Iesus vnto them, When ye haue lift vp the Sonne of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I doe nothing of my selfe, but as my Father hath taught me, so I speake these things. 
\v 29 For he that sent me, is with me: the Father hath not left me alone, because I do alwayes those things that please him. 
\v 30 As hee spake these thinges, many beleeued in him. 
\v 31 Then saide Iesus to the Iewes which beleeued in him, If ye continue in my worde, ye are verely my disciples, 
\v 32 And shall know the trueth, and the trueth shall make you free. 
\v 33 They answered him, Wee be Abrahams seede, and were neuer bonde to any man: why sayest thou then, Ye shalbe made free? 
\v 34 Iesus answered them, Verely, verely I say vnto you, that whosoeuer committeth sinne, is the seruant of sinne. 
\v 35 And the seruant abideth not in the house for euer: but the Sonne abideth for euer. 
\v 36 If that Sonne therefore shall make you free, ye shalbe free in deede. 
\v 37 I know that ye are Abrahams seede, but yee seeke to kill mee, because my worde hath no place in you. 
\v 38 I speake that which I haue seene with my Father: and ye doe that which ye haue seene with your father. 
\v 39 They answered, and saide vnto him, Abraham is our father. Iesus said vnto them, If ye were Abrahams children, ye woulde doe the workes of Abraham. 
\v 40 But nowe ye goe about to kill mee, a man that haue told you the trueth, which I haue heard of God: this did not Abraham. 
\v 41 Ye do the workes of your father. Then said they to him, We are not borne of fornication: we haue one Father, which is God. 
\v 42 Therefore Iesus sayde vnto them, If God were your Father, then woulde ye loue mee: for I proceeded foorth, and came from God, neither came I of my selfe, but he sent me. 
\v 43 Why doe ye not vnderstande my talke? because ye cannot heare my worde. 
\v 44 Ye are of your father the deuill, and the lustes of your father ye will doe: hee hath bene a murtherer from the beginning, and abode not in the trueth, because there is no trueth in him. When hee speaketh a lie, then speaketh hee of his owne: for he is a liar, and the father thereof. 
\v 45 And because I tell you the trueth, yee beleeue me not. 
\v 46 Which of you can rebuke me of sinne? and if I say the trueth, why do ye not beleeue me? 
\v 47 He that is of God, heareth Gods wordes: yee therefore heare them not, because ye are not of God. 
\v 48 Then answered the Iewes, and said vnto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritane, and hast a deuil? 
\v 49 Iesus answered, I haue not a deuil, but I honour my Father, and ye haue dishonoured me. 
\v 50 And I seeke not mine owne praise: but there is one that seeketh it, and iudgeth. 
\v 51 Verely, verely I say vnto you, If a man keepe my word, he shall neuer see death. 
\v 52 Then said the Iewes to him, Now know we that thou hast a deuill. Abraham is dead, and the Prophets: and thou sayest, If a man keepe my worde, he shall neuer taste of death. 
\v 53 Art thou greater then our father Abraham, which is dead? and the Prophets are dead: whome makest thou thy selfe? 
\v 54 Iesus answered, If I honour my selfe, mine honour is nothing worth: it is my Father that honoureth me, whome ye say, that hee is your God. 
\v 55 Yet ye haue not knowen him: but I knowe him, and if I should say I know him not, I should be a liar like vnto you: but I knowe him, and keepe his worde. 
\v 56 Your father Abraham reioyced to see my day, and he sawe it, and was glad. 
\v 57 Then sayd ye Iewes vnto him, Thou art not yet fiftie yeere olde, and hast thou seene Abraham? 
\v 58 Iesus sayd vnto them, Verely, verely I say vnto you, before Abraham was, I am. 
\v 59 Then tooke they vp stones, to cast at him, but Iesus hid himselfe, and went out of the Temple: And hee passed through the middes of them, and so went his way. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 And as Iesus passed by, he sawe a man which was blinde from his birth. 
\v 2 And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sinne, this man, or his parents, that he was borne blinde? 
\v 3 Iesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents, but that the workes of God should be shewed on him. 
\v 4 I must worke the workes of him that sent me, while it is day: the night commeth when no man can worke. 
\v 5 As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world. 
\v 6 Assoone as he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spettle, and anointed the eyes of the blinde with the clay, 
\v 7 And sayd vnto him, Go wash in the poole of Siloam (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came againe seeing. 
\v 8 Nowe the neighbours and they that had seene him before, when he was blinde, sayd, Is not this he that sate and begged? 
\v 9 Some said, This is he: and other sayd, He is like him: but he himselfe sayd, I am he. 
\v 10 Therefore they sayd vnto him, Howe were thine eyes opened? 
\v 11 He answered, and sayd, The man that is called Iesus, made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and sayde vnto me, Goe to the poole of Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and receiued sight. 
\v 12 Then they sayd vnto him, Where is he? He sayd, I can not tell. 
\v 13 They brought to the Pharises him that was once blinde. 
\v 14 And it was the Sabbath day, when Iesus made the clay, and opened his eyes. 
\v 15 Then againe the Pharises also asked him, how he had receiued sight. And hee sayd vnto them, He layd clay vpon mine eyes, and I washed, and doe see. 
\v 16 Then said some of the Pharises, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the Sabbath day. Others sayd, Howe can a man that is a sinner, doe such miracles? and there was a dissension among them. 
\v 17 Then spake they vnto the blinde againe, What sayest thou of him, because he hath opened thine eyes? And he sayd, He is a Prophet. 
\v 18 Then the Iewes did not beleeue him (that he had bene blinde, and receiued his sight) vntill they had called the parents of him that had receiued sight. 
\v 19 And they asked them, saying, Is this your sonne, whom ye say was borne blinde? How doeth he nowe see then? 
\v 20 His parents answered them, and sayd, We know that this is our sonne, and that he was borne blinde: 
\v 21 But by what meanes hee nowe seeth, we know not: or who hath opened his eyes, can we not tell: he is olde ynough: aske him: hee shall answere for himselfe. 
\v 22 These wordes spake his parents, because they feared the Iewes: for the Iewes had ordeined already, that if any man did confesse that he was Christ, he should be excommunicate out of the Synagogue. 
\v 23 Therefore sayde his parents, Hee is olde ynough: aske him. 
\v 24 Then againe called they the man that had bene blinde, and sayd vnto him, Giue glory vnto God: we know that this man is a sinner. 
\v 25 Then he answered, and sayd, Whether hee be a sinner or no, I can not tell: one thing I know, that I was blinde, and nowe I see. 
\v 26 Then sayd they to him againe, What did he to thee? howe opened he thine eyes? 
\v 27 Hee answered them, I haue tolde you already, and yee haue not heard it: wherefore would yee heare it againe? will yee also be his disciples? 
\v 28 Then reuiled they him, and sayd, Be thou his disciple: we be Moses disciples. 
\v 29 We know that God spake with Moses: but this man we know not from whence he is. 
\v 30 The man answered, and sayde vnto them, Doutlesse, this is a marueilous thing, that ye know not whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes. 
\v 31 Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him heareth he. 
\v 32 Since the world began, was it not heard, that any man opened the eyes of one that was borne blinde. 
\v 33 If this man were not of God, hee could haue done nothing. 
\v 34 They answered, and sayd vnto him, Thou art altogether borne in sinnes, and doest thou teach vs? so they cast him out. 
\v 35 Iesus heard that they had cast him out: and when he had found him, he sayd vnto him, Doest thou beleeue in the Sonne of God? 
\v 36 He answered, and sayd, Who is he, Lord, that I might beleeue in him? 
\v 37 And Iesus sayd vnto him, Both thou hast seene him, and he it is that talketh with thee. 
\v 38 Then he sayd, Lord, I beleeue, and worshipped him. 
\v 39 And Iesus sayd, I am come vnto iudgement into this world, that they which see not, might see: and that they which see, might be made blinde. 
\v 40 And some of the Pharises which were with him, heard these things, and sayd vnto him, Are we blinde also? 
\v 41 Iesus sayd vnto them, If ye were blinde, ye should not haue sinne: but nowe ye say, We see: therefore your sinne remaineth. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1 Verely, verely I say vnto you, Hee that entreth not in by the doore into the sheepefolde, but climeth vp another way, he is a theefe and a robber. 
\v 2 But he that goeth in by the doore, is the shepheard of the sheepe. 
\v 3 To him the porter openeth, and the sheepe heare his voyce, and he calleth his owne sheepe by name, and leadeth them out. 
\v 4 And when hee hath sent foorth his owne sheepe, he goeth before them, and the sheepe follow him: for they know his voyce. 
\v 5 And they will not follow a stranger, but they flee from him: for they know not the voyce of strangers. 
\v 6 This parable spake Iesus vnto them: but they vnderstoode not what things they were which he spake vnto them. 
\v 7 Then sayd Iesus vnto them againe, Verely, verely I say vnto you, I am that doore of the sheepe. 
\v 8 All, that euer came before me, are theeues and robbers: but the sheepe did not heare them. 
\v 9 I am that doore: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saued, and shall go in, and go out, and finde pasture. 
\v 10 The theefe commeth not, but for to steale, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might haue life, and haue it in abundance. 
\v 11 I am that good shepheard: that good shepheard giueth his life for his sheepe. 
\v 12 But an hireling, and hee which is not the shepheard, neither the sheepe are his owne, seeth the wolfe comming, and hee leaueth the sheepe, and fleeth, and the wolfe catcheth them, and scattreth the sheepe. 
\v 13 So the hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheepe. 
\v 14 I am that good shepheard, and knowe mine, and am knowen of mine. 
\v 15 As the Father knoweth me, so know I the Father: and I lay downe my life for my sheepe. 
\v 16 Other sheepe I haue also, which are not of this folde: them also must I bring, and they shall heare my voyce: and there shalbe one sheepefolde, and one shepheard. 
\v 17 Therefore doeth my Father loue me, because I lay downe my life, that I might take it againe. 
\v 18 No man taketh it from me, but I lay it downe of my selfe: I haue power to lay it downe, and haue power to take it againe: this commandement haue I receiued of my Father. 
\v 19 Then there was a dissension againe among the Iewes for these sayings, 
\v 20 And many of them sayd, He hath a deuill, and is mad: why heare ye him? 
\v 21 Other sayd, These are not the wordes of him that hath a deuill: can the deuill open the eyes of the blinde? 
\v 22 And it was at Hierusalem the feast of the Dedication, and it was winter. 
\v 23 And Iesus walked in the Temple, in Salomons porche. 
\v 24 Then came the Iewes round about him, and sayd vnto him, Howe long doest thou make vs dout? If thou be that Christ, tell vs plainely. 
\v 25 Iesus answered them, I tolde you, and ye beleeue not: the workes that I doe in my Fathers Name, they beare witnes of me. 
\v 26 But ye beleeue not: for ye are not of my sheepe, as I sayd vnto you. 
\v 27 My sheepe heare my voyce, and I knowe them, and they follow me, 
\v 28 And I giue vnto them eternall life, and they shall neuer perish, neither shall any plucke them out of mine hand. 
\v 29 My Father which gaue them me, is greater then all, and none is able to take them out of my Fathers hand. 
\v 30 I and my Father are one. 
\v 31 Then ye Iewes againe tooke vp stones, to stone him. 
\v 32 Iesus answered them, Many good workes haue I shewed you from my Father: for which of these workes doe ye stone me? 
\v 33 The Iewes answered him, saying, For the good worke we stone thee not, but for blasphemie, and that thou being a man, makest thy selfe God. 
\v 34 Iesus answered them, Is it not written in your Lawe, I sayd, Ye are gods? 
\v 35 If hee called them gods, vnto whome the worde of God was giuen, and the Scripture cannot be broken, 
\v 36 Say ye of him, whome the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the worlde, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Sonne of God? 
\v 37 If I doe not the workes of my Father, beleeue me not. 
\v 38 But if I doe, then though ye beleeue not mee, yet beleeue the workes, that ye may knowe and beleeue, that the Father is in me, and I in him. 
\v 39 Againe they went about to take him: but he escaped out of their handes, 
\v 40 And went againe beyonde Iordan, into the place where Iohn first baptized, and there abode. 
\v 41 And many resorted vnto him, and saide, Iohn did no miracle: but all thinges that Iohn spake of this man, were true. 
\v 42 And many beleeued in him there. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 And a certaine man was sicke, named Lazarus of Bethania, the towne of Marie, and her sister Martha. 
\v 2 (And it was that Mary which anointed the Lord with oyntment, and wiped his feete with her heare, whose brother Lazarus was sicke.) 
\v 3 Therefore his sisters sent vnto him, saying, Lord, beholde, he whome thou louest, is sicke. 
\v 4 When Iesus heard it, he saide, This sickenes is not vnto death, but for the glorie of God, that the Sonne of God might be glorified thereby. 
\v 5 Nowe Iesus loued Martha and her sister, and Lazarus. 
\v 6 And after he had heard that he was sicke, yet abode hee two dayes still in the same place where he was. 
\v 7 Then after that, said he to his disciples, Let vs goe into Iudea againe. 
\v 8 The disciples saide vnto him, Master, the Iewes lately sought to stone thee, and doest thou goe thither againe? 
\v 9 Iesus answered, Are there not twelue houres in the day? If a man walke in the day, hee stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world. 
\v 10 But if a man walke in the night, hee stumbleth, because there is no light in him. 
\v 11 These things spake he, and after, he said vnto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth: but I goe to wake him vp. 
\v 12 Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleepe, he shalbe safe. 
\v 13 Howbeit, Iesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of the naturall sleepe. 
\v 14 Then saide Iesus vnto them plainely, Lazarus is dead. 
\v 15 And I am glad for your sakes, that I was not there, that ye may beleeue: but let vs go vnto him. 
\v 16 Then saide Thomas (which is called Didymus) vnto his felow disciples, Let vs also goe, that we may die with him. 
\v 17 Then came Iesus, and found that he had lien in the graue foure dayes alreadie. 
\v 18 (Nowe Bethania was neere vnto Hierusalem, about fifteene furlongs off.) 
\v 19 And many of ye Iewes were come to Martha and Marie to comfort them for their brother. 
\v 20 Then Martha, when shee heard that Iesus was comming, went to meete him: but Mary sate still in the house. 
\v 21 Then said Martha vnto Iesus, Lord, if thou hadst bene here, my brother had not bene dead. 
\v 22 But now I know also, that whatsoeuer thou askest of God, God will giue it thee. 
\v 23 Iesus said vnto her, Thy brother shall rise againe. 
\v 24 Martha said vnto him, I know that he shall rise againe in the resurrection at the last day. 
\v 25 Iesus saide vnto her, I am the resurrection and the life: he that beleeueth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he liue. 
\v 26 And whosoeuer liueth, and beleeueth in me, shall neuer die: Beleeuest thou this? 
\v 27 She said vnto him, Yea, Lord, I beleeue that thou art that Christ that Sonne of God, which should come into the world. 
\v 28 And when she had so saide, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee. 
\v 29 And when she heard it, shee arose quickly, and came vnto him. 
\v 30 For Iesus was not yet come into the towne, but was in the place where Martha met him. 
\v 31 The Iewes then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they sawe Marie, that she rose vp hastily, and went out, folowed her, saying, She goeth vnto the graue, to weepe there. 
\v 32 Then when Mary was come where Iesus was, and sawe him, she fell downe at his feete, saying vnto him, Lord, if thou haddest bene here, my brother had not bene dead. 
\v 33 When Iesus therefore saw her weepe, and the Iewes also weepe which came with her, hee groned in the spirit, and was troubled in himselfe, 
\v 34 And saide, Where haue ye layde him? They said vnto him, Lord, come and see. 
\v 35 And Iesus wept. 
\v 36 Then saide the Iewes, Beholde, how he loued him. 
\v 37 And some of them saide, Coulde not he, which opened the eyes of the blinde, haue made also, that this man should not haue died? 
\v 38 Iesus therefore againe groned in himselfe, and came to the graue. And it was a caue, and a stone was layde vpon it. 
\v 39 Iesus saide, Take ye away the stone. Martha the sister of him that was dead, said vnto him, Lord, he stinketh alreadie: for he hath bene dead foure dayes. 
\v 40 Iesus saide vnto her, Saide I not vnto thee, that if thou diddest beleeue, thou shouldest see the glorie of God? 
\v 41 Then they tooke away the stone from the place where the dead was layde. And Iesus lift vp his eyes, and saide, Father, I thanke thee, because thou hast heard me. 
\v 42 I knowe that thou hearest me alwayes, but because of the people that stand by, I said it, that they may beleeue, that thou hast sent me. 
\v 43 As hee had spoken these things, hee cried with a loude voyce, Lazarus, come foorth. 
\v 44 Then he that was dead, came forth, bound hande and foote with bandes, and his face was bound with a napkin. Iesus said vnto them, Loose him, and let him goe. 
\v 45 Then many of the Iewes, which came to Mary, and had seene the thinges, which Iesus did, beleeued in him. 
\v 46 But some of them went their way to the Pharises, and told them what things Iesus had done. 
\v 47 Then gathered the hie Priests, and the Pharises a councill, and said, What shall we doe? For this man doeth many miracles. 
\v 48 If we let him thus alone, all men will beleeue in him, and the Romanes will come and take away both our place, and the nation. 
\v 49 Then one of them named Caiaphas, which was the hie Priest that same yere, said vnto them, Ye perceiue nothing at all, 
\v 50 Nor yet doe you consider that it is expedient for vs, that one man die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not. 
\v 51 This spake hee not of himselfe: but being hie Priest that same yere, he prophecied that Iesus should die for that nation: 
\v 52 And not for that nation onely, but that he shoulde gather together in one the children of God, which were scattered. 
\v 53 Then from that day foorth they consulted together, to put him to death. 
\v 54 Iesus therefore walked no more openly among the Iewes, but went thence vnto a countrey neere to the wildernes, into a citie called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples. 
\v 55 And the Iewes Passeouer was at hande, and many went out of the countrey vp to Hierusalem before the Passeouer, to purifie themselues. 
\v 56 Then sought they for Iesus, and spake among themselues, as they stoode in the Temple, What thinke ye, that he cometh not to the feast? 
\v 57 Now both the high Priestes and the Pharises had giuen a commandement, that if any man knew where he were, he should shew it, that they might take him. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 Then Iesus, sixe dayes before the Passeouer, came to Bethania, where Lazarus was, who died, whom he had raised from the dead. 
\v 2 There they made him a supper, and Martha serued: but Lazarus was one of them that sate at the table with him. 
\v 3 Then tooke Mary a pound of oyntment of Spikenarde very costly, and anoynted Iesus feete, and wiped his feete with her heare, and the house was filled with the sauour of the oyntment. 
\v 4 Then said one of his disciples, euen Iudas Iscariot Simons sonne, which should betray him: 
\v 5 Why was not this oyntment sold for three hundreth pence, and giuen to the poore? 
\v 6 Nowe he said this, not that he cared for the poore, but because hee was a theefe, and had the bagge, and bare that which was giuen. 
\v 7 Then said Iesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying she kept it. 
\v 8 For the poore alwayes yee haue with you, but me ye shall not haue alwayes. 
\v 9 Then much people of the Iewes knewe that hee was there: and they came, not for Iesus sake onely, but that they might see Lazarus also, whome he had raysed from the dead. 
\v 10 The hie Priestes therefore consulted, that they might put Lazarus to death also, 
\v 11 Because that for his sake many of the Iewes went away, and beleeued in Iesus. 
\v 12 On the morowe a great multitude that were come to the feast, when they heard that Iesus should come to Hierusalem, 
\v 13 Tooke branches of palme trees, and went foorth to meete him, and cried, Hosanna, Blessed is the King of Israel that commeth in the Name of the Lord. 
\v 14 And Iesus found a yong asse, and sate thereon, as it is written, 
\v 15 Feare not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King commeth sitting on an asses colte. 
\v 16 But his disciples vnderstoode not these thinges at the first: but when Iesus was glorified, then remembred they, that these thinges were written of him, and that they had done these things vnto him. 
\v 17 The people therefore that was with him, bare witnesse that hee called Lazarus out of the graue, and raised him from the dead. 
\v 18 Therefore mette him the people also, because they heard that he had done this miracle. 
\v 19 And the Pharises said among themselues, Perceiue ye howe ye preuaile nothing? Beholde, the worlde goeth after him. 
\v 20 Nowe there were certaine Greekes among them that came vp to worship at the feast. 
\v 21 And they came to Philippe, which was of Bethsaida in Galile, and desired him, saying, Syr, we would see that Iesus. 
\v 22 Philippe came and tolde Andrew: and againe Andrew and Philippe tolde Iesus. 
\v 23 And Iesus answered them, saying, The houre is come, that the Sonne of man must bee glorified. 
\v 24 Verely, verely I say vnto you, Except the wheate corne fall into the grounde and die, it bideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth foorth much fruite. 
\v 25 He that loueth his life, shall lose it, and he that hateth his life in this world, shall keepe it vnto life eternall. 
\v 26 If any man serue me, let him follow me: for where I am, there shall also my seruant be: and if any man serue me, him will my Father honour. 
\v 27 Now is my soule troubled: and what shall I say? Father, saue me from this houre: but therefore came I vnto this houre. 
\v 28 Father, glorifie thy Name. Then came there a voyce from heauen, saying, I haue both glorified it, and will glorifie it againe. 
\v 29 Then saide the people that stoode by, and heard, that it was a thunder: other said, An Angel spake to him. 
\v 30 Iesus answered, and said, This voyce came not because of me, but for your sakes. 
\v 31 Now is the iudgement of this world: nowe shall the prince of this world be cast out. 
\v 32 And I, if I were lift vp from the earth, will drawe all men vnto me. 
\v 33 Nowe this sayd he, signifying what death he should die. 
\v 34 The people answered him, We haue heard out of the Law, that that Christ bideth for euer: and howe sayest thou, that that Sonne of man must be lift vp? Who is that Sonne of man? 
\v 35 Then Iesus sayd vnto them, Yet a litle while is the light with you: walke while ye haue that light, lest the darkenes come vpon you: for hee that walketh in the darke, knoweth not whither he goeth. 
\v 36 While ye haue that light, beleeue in that light, that ye may be the children of the light. These things spake Iesus, and departed, and hid himselfe from them. 
\v 37 And though he had done so many miracles before them, yet beleeued they not on him, 
\v 38 That the saying of Esaias the Prophete might be fulfilled, that he sayd, Lord, who beleeued our report? and to whome is the arme of the Lord reueiled? 
\v 39 Therefore could they not beleeue, because that Esaias saith againe, 
\v 40 He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart, that they shoulde not see with their eyes, nor vnderstand with their heart, and should be conuerted, and I should heale them. 
\v 41 These things sayd Esaias when he sawe his glory, and spake of him. 
\v 42 Neuertheles, euen among the chiefe rulers, many beleeued in him: but because of the Pharises they did not confesse him, least they should be cast out of the Synagogue. 
\v 43 For they loued the prayse of men, more then the prayse of God. 
\v 44 And Iesus cryed, and sayd, He that beleeueth in me, beleeueth not in me, but in him that sent me. 
\v 45 And he that seeth me, seeth him that sent me. 
\v 46 I am come a light into the world, that whosoeuer beleeueth in me, should not abide in darkenes. 
\v 47 And if any man heare my wordes, and beleeue not, I iudge him not: for I came not to iudge the world, but to saue the world. 
\v 48 He that refuseth me, and receiueth not my wordes, hath one that iudgeth him: the worde that I haue spoken, it shall iudge him in the last day. 
\v 49 For I haue not spoken of my selfe: but the Father which sent me, hee gaue me a commandement what I should say, and what I should speake. 
\v 50 And I knowe that his commandement is life euerlasting: the thinges therefore that I speake, I speake them so as the Father sayde vnto me. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 Nowe before the feast of the Passeouer, when Iesus knewe that his houre was come, that he should depart out of this world vnto the Father, forasmuch as he loued his owne which were in the world, vnto the end he loued them. 
\v 2 And when supper was done (and that the deuill had now put in the heart of Iudas Iscariot, Simons sonne, to betray him) 
\v 3 Iesus knowing that the Father had giuen all things into his hands, and that he was come forth from God, and went to God, 
\v 4 He riseth from supper, and layeth aside his vpper garments, and tooke a towel, and girded himselfe. 
\v 5 After that, hee powred water into a basen, and began to wash the disciples feete, and to wipe them with the towell, wherewith he was girded. 
\v 6 Then came he to Simon Peter, who sayd to him, Lord, doest thou wash my feete? 
\v 7 Iesus answered and sayd vnto him, What I doe, thou knowest not nowe: but thou shalt knowe it hereafter. 
\v 8 Peter said vnto him, Thou shalt neuer wash my feete. Iesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou shalt haue no part with me. 
\v 9 Simon Peter sayd vnto him, Lord, not my feete onely, but also the hands and the head. 
\v 10 Iesus sayd to him, He that is washed, needeth not, saue to wash his feete, but is cleane euery whit: and ye are cleane, but not all. 
\v 11 For hee knewe who should betray him: therefore sayd he, Ye are not all cleane. 
\v 12 So after he had washed their feete, and had taken his garments, and was set downe againe, he sayd vnto them, Knowe ye what I haue done to you? 
\v 13 Ye call me Master, and Lord, and ye say well: for so am I. 
\v 14 If I then your Lord, and Master, haue washed your feete, ye also ought to wash one an others feete. 
\v 15 For I haue giuen you an example, that ye should doe, euen as I haue done to you. 
\v 16 Verely, verely I say vnto you, The seruant is not greater then his master, neither the ambassadour greater then he that sent him. 
\v 17 If ye know these things, blessed are ye, if ye doe them. 
\v 18 I speake not of you all: I know whom I haue chosen: but it is that the Scripture might be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me, hath lift vp his heele against me. 
\v 19 From henceforth tell I you before it come, that when it is come to passe, ye might beleeue that I am he. 
\v 20 Verely, verely I say vnto you, If I send any, he that receiueth him, receiueth me, and hee that receiueth me, receiueth him that sent me. 
\v 21 When Iesus had sayd these things, he was troubled in the Spirit, and testified, and said, Verely, verely I say vnto you, that one of you shall betray me. 
\v 22 Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake. 
\v 23 Nowe there was one of his disciples, which leaned on Iesus bosome, whom Iesus loued. 
\v 24 To him beckened therefore Simon Peter, that he should aske who it was of whom he spake. 
\v 25 He then, as he leaned on Iesus breast, saide vnto him, Lord, who is it? 
\v 26 Iesus answered, He it is, to whome I shall giue a soppe, when I haue dipt it: and hee wet a soppe, and gaue it to Iudas Iscariot, Simons sonne. 
\v 27 And after the soppe, Satan entred into him. Then sayd Iesus vnto him, That thou doest, doe quickly. 
\v 28 But none of them that were at table, knew, for what cause he spake it vnto him. 
\v 29 For some of them thought because Iudas had the bag, that Iesus had sayd vnto him, Buy those things that we haue neede of against ye feast: or that he should giue some thing to the poore. 
\v 30 Assoone then as he had receiued the soppe, he went immediately out, and it was night. 
\v 31 When hee was gone out, Iesus sayd, Nowe is the Sonne of man glorified, and God is glorified in him. 
\v 32 If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorifie him in himselfe, and shall straightway glorifie him. 
\v 33 Litle children, yet a litle while am I with you: ye shall seeke me, but as I sayde vnto the Iewes, Whither I goe, can ye not come: also to you say I nowe, 
\v 34 A newe commandement giue I vnto you, that ye loue one another: as I haue loued you, that ye also loue one another. 
\v 35 By this shall all men knowe that ye are my disciples, if ye haue loue one to another. 
\v 36 Simon Peter said vnto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Iesus answered him, Whither I goe, thou canst not follow me nowe: but thou shalt follow me afterward. 
\v 37 Peter sayd vnto him, Lord, why can I not follow thee now? I will lay downe my life for thy sake. 
\v 38 Iesus answered him, Wilt thou lay downe thy life for my sake? Verely, verely I say vnto thee, The cocke shall not crowe, till thou haue denied me thrise. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1 Let not your heart be troubled: ye beleeue in God, beleeue also in me. 
\v 2 In my Fathers house are many dwelling places: if it were not so, I would haue tolde you: I go to prepare a place for you. 
\v 3 And if I go to prepare a place for you, I wil come againe, and receiue you vnto my selfe, that where I am, there may ye be also. 
\v 4 And whither I go, ye know, and the way ye knowe. 
\v 5 Thomas sayd vnto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest: how can we then know ye way? 
\v 6 Iesus sayd vnto him, I am that Way, and that Trueth, and that Life. No man commeth vnto the Father, but by me. 
\v 7 If ye had knowen mee, ye should haue knowen my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and haue seene him. 
\v 8 Philippe sayd vnto him, Lord, shewe vs thy Father, and it sufficeth vs. 
\v 9 Iesus sayd vnto him, I haue bene so long time with you, and hast thou not knowen mee, Philippe? he that hath seene me, hath seene my Father: how then sayest thou, Shewe vs thy Father? 
\v 10 Beleeuest thou not, that I am in the Father, and the Father is in me? The wordes that I speake vnto you, I speake not of my selfe: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the workes. 
\v 11 Beleeue me, that I am in the Father, and the Father is in me: at the least, beleeue me for the very workes sake. 
\v 12 Verely, verely I say vnto you, he that beleeueth in me, the workes that I doe, hee shall doe also, and greater then these shall he doe: for I goe vnto my Father. 
\v 13 And whatsoeuer ye aske in my Name, that will I doe, that the Father may be glorified in the Sonne. 
\v 14 If ye shall aske any thing in my Name, I will doe it. 
\v 15 If ye loue me, keepe my comandements, 
\v 16 And I wil pray the Father, and he shall giue you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for euer, 
\v 17 Euen the Spirit of trueth, whome the world can not receiue, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye knowe him: for he dwelleth with you, and shalbe in you. 
\v 18 I will not leaue you fatherles: but I will come to you. 
\v 19 Yet a litle while, and the world shall see me no more, but ye shall see me: because I liue, ye shall liue also. 
\v 20 At that day shall ye knowe that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you. 
\v 21 He that hath my commandements, and keepeth them, is he that loueth me: and he that loueth me, shall be loued of my Father: and I will loue him, and wil shewe mine owne selfe to him. 
\v 22 Iudas sayd vnto him (not Iscariot) Lord, what is the cause that thou wilt shewe thy selfe vnto vs, and not vnto the world? 
\v 23 Iesus answered, and sayd vnto him, If any man loue me, he will keepe my worde, and my Father will loue him, and we wil come vnto him, and wil dwell with him. 
\v 24 He that loueth me not, keepeth not my wordes, and the worde which ye heare, is not mine, but the Fathers which sent me. 
\v 25 These things haue I spoken vnto you, being present with you. 
\v 26 But the Comforter, which is the holy Ghost, whom the Father wil send in my Name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, which I haue tolde you. 
\v 27 Peace I leaue with you: my peace I giue vnto you: not as the worlde giueth, giue I vnto you. Let not your heart be troubled, nor feare. 
\v 28 Ye haue heard howe I saide vnto you, I goe away, and will come vnto you. If ye loued me, ye would verely reioyce, because I said, I goe vnto the Father: for the Father is greater then I. 
\v 29 And nowe haue I spoken vnto you, before it come, that when it is come to passe, ye might beleeue. 
\v 30 Hereafter will I not speake many things vnto you: for the prince of this world commeth, and hath nought in me. 
\v 31 But it is that the world may knowe that I loue my Father: and as the Father hath commanded me, so I doe. Arise, let vs goe hence.

\v 1 I Am that true vine, and my Father is that husband man. 
\v 2 Euery branch that beareth not fruite in me, he taketh away: and euery one that beareth fruite, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruite. 
\v 3 Nowe are ye cleane through the worde, which I haue spoken vnto you. 
\v 4 Abide in me, and I in you: as the branche cannot beare fruite of it selfe, except it abide in the vine, no more can ye, except ye abide in me. 
\v 5 I am that vine: ye are the branches: he that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruite: for without me can ye doe nothing. 
\v 6 If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branche, and withereth: and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they burne. 
\v 7 If ye abide in me, and my wordes abide in you, aske what ye wil, and it shalbe done to you. 
\v 8 Herein is my Father glorified, that ye beare much fruite, and be made my disciples. 
\v 9 As the father hath loued me, so haue I loued you: continue in that my loue. 
\v 10 If ye shall keepe my commandements, ye shall abide in my loue, as I haue kept my Fathers commandements, and abide in his loue. 
\v 11 These things haue I spoken vnto you, that my ioy might remaine in you, and that your ioy might be full. 
\v 12 This is my commandement, that ye loue one another, as I haue loued you. 
\v 13 Greater loue then this hath no man, when any man bestoweth his life for his friendes. 
\v 14 Ye are my friendes, if ye doe whatsoeuer I commaund you. 
\v 15 Henceforth call I you not seruants: for the seruant knoweth not what his master doeth: but I haue called you friends: for all things that I haue heard of my Father, haue I made knowen to you. 
\v 16 Ye haue not chosen me, but I haue chosen you, and ordeined you, that ye goe and bring foorth fruite, and that your fruite remaine, that whatsoeuer ye shall aske of the Father in my Name, he may giue it you. 
\v 17 These things commaund I you, that ye loue one another. 
\v 18 If the worlde hate you, ye knowe that it hated me before you. 
\v 19 If ye were of the worlde, the world woulde loue his owne: but because ye are not of ye world, but I haue chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. 
\v 20 Remember the word that I said vnto you, The seruant is not greater then his master. If they haue persecuted me, they will persecute you also: if they haue kept my worde, they will also keepe yours. 
\v 21 But all these things will they doe vnto you for my Names sake, because they haue not knowen him that sent me. 
\v 22 If I had not come and spoken vnto them, they shoulde not haue had sinne: but nowe haue they no cloke for their sinne. 
\v 23 He that hateth me, hateth my Father also. 
\v 24 If I had not done workes among them which none other man did, they had not had sinne: but nowe haue they both seene, and haue hated both me, and my Father. 
\v 25 But it is that the worde might be fulfilled, that is written in their Lawe, They hated me without a cause. 
\v 26 But when that Comforter shall come, whom I will send vnto you from the Father, euen the Spirit of trueth, which proceedeth of the Father, he shall testifie of me. 
\v 27 And ye shall witnesse also, because ye haue bene with me from the beginning. 
\c 16  
\p
\v 1 These thinges haue I saide vnto you, that ye should not be offended. 
\v 2 They shall excommunicate you: yea, the time shall come, that whosoeuer killeth you, will thinke that he doeth God seruice. 
\v 3 And these things will they doe vnto you, because they haue not knowen ye Father, nor me. 
\v 4 But these things haue I tolde you, that when the houre shall come, ye might remember, that I tolde you them. And these things said I not vnto you from ye beginning, because I was with you. 
\v 5 But now I go my way to him that sent me, and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou? 
\v 6 But because I haue saide these thinges vnto you, your hearts are full of sorowe. 
\v 7 Yet I tell you the trueth, It is expedient for you that I goe away: for if I goe not away, that Comforter will not come vnto you: but if I depart, I will send him vnto you. 
\v 8 And when he is come, he will reproue the worlde of sinne, and of righteousnesse, and of iudgement. 
\v 9 Of sinne, because they beleeued not in me: 
\v 10 Of righteousnesse, because I goe to my Father, and ye shall see me no more: 
\v 11 Of iudgement, because the prince of this world is iudged. 
\v 12 I haue yet many things to say vnto you, but ye cannot beare them nowe. 
\v 13 Howbeit, when he is come which is the Spirit of trueth, he will leade you into all trueth: for he shall not speake of himselfe, but whatsoeuer he shall heare, shall he speake, and he will shew you the things to come. 
\v 14 He shall glorifie me: for he shall receiue of mine, and shall shewe it vnto you. 
\v 15 All thinges that the Father hath, are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shewe it vnto you. 
\v 16 A litle while, and ye shall not see me: and againe a litle while, and ye shall see me: for I goe to the Father. 
\v 17 Then said some of his disciples among them selues, What is this that he saieth vnto vs, A litle while, and ye shall not see me, and againe, a litle while, and ye shall see me, and, For I goe to the Father. 
\v 18 They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A litle while? we know not what he sayeth. 
\v 19 Now Iesus knew that they would aske him, and said vnto them, Doe ye enquire among your selues, of that I said, A litle while, and ye shall not see me: and againe, a litle while, and yee shall see me? 
\v 20 Verely, verely I say vnto you, that ye shall weepe and lament, and the worlde shall reioyce: and ye shall sorowe, but your sorowe shalbe turned to ioye. 
\v 21 A woman when she traueileth, hath sorowe, because her houre is come: but assoone as she is deliuered of the childe, she remembreth no more the anguish, for ioy that a man is borne into the world. 
\v 22 And ye nowe therefore are in sorowe: but I will see you againe, and your hearts shall reioyce, and your ioy shall no man take from you. 
\v 23 And in that day shall ye aske me nothing. Verely, verely I say vnto you, whatsoeuer ye shall aske the Father in my Name, he will giue it you. 
\v 24 Hitherto haue ye asked nothing in my Name: aske, and ye shall receiue, that your ioye may be full. 
\v 25 These things haue I spoken vnto you in parables: but the time will come, when I shall no more speake to you in parables: but I shall shew you plainely of the Father. 
\v 26 At that day shall ye aske in my Name, and I say not vnto you, that I will pray vnto the Father for you: 
\v 27 For the Father himselfe loueth you, because ye haue loued me, and haue beleeued that I came out from God. 
\v 28 I am come out from the Father, and came into the worlde: againe I leaue the worlde, and goe to the Father. 
\v 29 His disciples saide vnto him, Loe, nowe speakest thou plainely, and thou speakest no parable. 
\v 30 Nowe knowe wee that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should aske thee. By this we beleeue, that thou art come out from God. 
\v 31 Iesus answered them, Doe you beleeue nowe? 
\v 32 Beholde, the houre commeth, and is already come, that ye shalbe scattered euery man into his owne, and shall leaue me alone: but I am not alone: for the Father is with me. 
\v 33 These thinges haue I spoken vnto you, that in me ye might haue peace: in the world ye shall haue affliction, but be of good comfort: I haue ouercome the world. 
\c 17  
\p
\v 1 These things spake Iesus, and lift vp his eyes to heauen, and saide, Father, that houre is come: glorifie thy Sonne, that thy Sonne also may glorifie thee, 
\v 2 As thou hast giuen him power ouer all flesh, that he shoulde giue eternall life to all them that thou hast giuen him. 
\v 3 And this is life eternall, that they knowe thee to be the onely very God, and whom thou hast sent, Iesus Christ. 
\v 4 I haue glorified thee on the earth: I haue finished the worke which thou gauest me to doe. 
\v 5 And nowe glorifie me, thou Father, with thine owne selfe, with the glorie which I had with thee before the world was. 
\v 6 I haue declared thy Name vnto the men which thou gauest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gauest them me, and they haue kept thy worde. 
\v 7 Nowe they knowe that all things whatsoeuer thou hast giuen me, are of thee. 
\v 8 For I haue giuen vnto them the wordes which thou gauest me, and they haue receiued them, and haue knowen surely that I came out from thee, and haue beleeued that thou hast sent me. 
\v 9 I pray for them: I pray not for the worlde, but for them which thou hast giuen me: for they are thine. 
\v 10 And al mine are thine, and thine are mine, and I am glorified in them. 
\v 11 And nowe am I no more in the world, but these are in the worlde, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keepe them in thy Name, euen them whome thou hast giuen mee, that they may bee one, as we are. 
\v 12 While I was with them in the worlde, I kept them in thy Name: those that thou gauest me, haue I kept, and none of them is lost, but the childe of perdition, that the Scripture might be fulfilled. 
\v 13 And now come I to thee, and these things speake I in the worlde, that they might haue my ioy fulfilled in themselues. 
\v 14 I haue giuen them thy word, and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, as I am not of the world. 
\v 15 I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou keepe them from euill. 
\v 16 They are not of the worlde, as I am not of the world. 
\v 17 Sanctifie them with thy trueth: thy word is trueth. 
\v 18 As thou diddest send me into the world, so haue I sent them into the world. 
\v 19 And for their sakes sanctifie I my selfe, that they also may bee sanctified through the trueth. 
\v 20 I praie not for these alone, but for them also which shall beleeue in mee, through their woorde, 
\v 21 That they all may bee one, as thou, O Father, art in me, and I in thee: euen that they may be also one in vs, that the worlde may beleeue that thou hast sent me. 
\v 22 And the glory that thou gauest me, I haue giuen them, that they may be one, as we are one, 
\v 23 I in them, and thou in mee, that they may be made perfect in one, and that the worlde may knowe that thou hast sent mee, and hast loued them, as thou hast loued me. 
\v 24 Father, I will that they which thou hast giuen me, be with me euen where I am, that they may beholde that my glorie, which thou hast giuen mee: for thou louedst me before the foundation of the world. 
\v 25 O righteous Father, the worlde also hath not knowen thee, but I haue knowen thee, and these haue knowen, that thou hast sent me. 
\v 26 And I haue declared vnto the thy Name, and will declare it, that the loue wherewith thou hast loued me, may be in them, and I in them.

\p
\v 1 When Iesus had spoken these things, hee went foorth with his disciples ouer the brooke Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entred, and his disciples. 
\v 2 And Iudas which betraied him, knewe also the place: for Iesus oft times resorted thither with his disciples. 
\v 3 Iudas then, after hee had receiued a band of men and officers of the high Priests, and of the Pharises, came thither with lanternes and torches, and weapons. 
\v 4 Then Iesus, knowing all things that shoulde come vnto him, went foorth and said vnto them, Whom seeke yee? 
\v 5 They answered him, Iesus of Nazareth. Iesus sayde vnto them, I am hee. Nowe Iudas also which betraied him, stoode with them. 
\v 6 Assoone then as hee had saide vnto them, I am hee, they went away backewardes, and fell to the grounde. 
\v 7 Then he asked them againe, Whome seeke yee? And they sayd, Iesus of Nazareth. 
\v 8 Iesus answered, I said vnto you, that I am he: therefore if ye seeke me, let these go their way. 
\v 9 This was that the worde might be fulfilled which hee spake, Of them which thou gauest me, haue I lost none. 
\v 10 Then Simon Peter hauing a sword, drewe it, and smote the hie Priests seruant, and cut off his right eare. Nowe the seruants name was Malchus. 
\v 11 Then sayde Iesus vnto Peter, Put vp thy sworde into the sheath: shall I not drinke of the cuppe which my Father hath giuen me? 
\v 12 Then the bande and the captaine, and the officers of the Iewes tooke Iesus, and bound him, 
\v 13 And led him away to Annas first (for he was father in lawe to Caiaphas, which was the hie Priest that same yeere) 
\v 14 And Caiaphas was he, that gaue counsel to the Iewes, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people. 
\v 15 Nowe Simon Peter folowed Iesus, and another disciple, and that disciple was knowen of the hie Priest: therefore he went in with Iesus into the hall of the hie Priest: 
\v 16 But Peter stood at the doore without. Then went out the other disciple which was knowen vnto the hie Priest, and spake to her that kept the doore, and brought in Peter. 
\v 17 Then saide the maide that kept the doore, vnto Peter, Art not thou also one of this mans disciples? He sayd, I am not. 
\v 18 And the seruants and officers stoode there, which had made a fire of coles: for it was colde, and they warmed themselues. And Peter also stood among them, and warmed himselfe. 
\v 19 (The hie Priest then asked Iesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine. 
\v 20 Iesus answered him, I spake openly to the world: I euer taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whither the Iewes resort continually, and in secret haue I sayde nothing. 
\v 21 Why askest thou mee? aske them which heard mee what I sayde vnto them: beholde, they knowe what I sayd. 
\v 22 When he had spoken these thinges, one of the officers which stoode by, smote Iesus with his rod, saying, Answerest thou the hie Priest so? 
\v 23 Iesus answered him, If I haue euill spoken, beare witnes of the euil: but if I haue well spoken, why smitest thou me? 
\v 24 Nowe Annas had sent him bound vnto Caiaphas the hie Priest) 
\v 25 And Simon Peter stoode and warmed himselfe, and they said vnto him, Art not thou also of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not. 
\v 26 One of the seruaunts of the hie Priest, his cousin whose eare Peter smote off, saide, Did not I see thee in the garden with him? 
\v 27 Peter then denied againe, and immediatly the cocke crewe. 
\v 28 Then led they Iesus from Caiaphas into the common hall. Nowe it was morning, and they themselues went not into the common hall, least they should be defiled, but that they might eate the Passeouer. 
\v 29 Pilate then went out vnto them, and said, What accusation bring yee against this man? 
\v 30 They answered, and saide vnto him, If hee were not an euill doer, we woulde not haue deliuered him vnto thee. 
\v 31 Then sayde Pilate vnto them, Take yee him, and iudge him after your owne Lawe. Then the Iewes sayde vnto him, It is not lawfull for vs to put any man to death. 
\v 32 It was that the worde of Iesus might be fulfilled which he spake, signifying what death he should die. 
\v 33 So Pilate entred into the common hall againe, and called Iesus, and sayde vnto him, Art thou the king of the Iewes? 
\v 34 Iesus answered him, Saiest thou that of thy selfe, or did other tell it thee of me? 
\v 35 Pilate answered, Am I a Iewe? Thine owne nation, and the hie Priestes haue deliuered thee vnto me. What hast thou done? 
\v 36 Iesus answered, My kingdome is not of this worlde: if my kingdome were of this worlde, my seruants would surely fight, that I should not be deliuered to the Iewes: but nowe is my kingdome not from hence. 
\v 37 Pilate then said vnto him, Art thou a King then? Iesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a King: for this cause am I borne, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should beare witnes vnto the trueth: euery one that is of the trueth, heareth my voyce. 
\v 38 Pilate said vnto him, What is trueth? And when he had saide that, hee went out againe vnto the Iewes, and said vnto them, I finde in him no cause at all. 
\v 39 But you haue a custome, that I shoulde deliuer you one loose at the Passeouer: will yee then that I loose vnto you the King of ye Iewes? 
\v 40 Then cried they all againe, saying, Not him, but Barabbas: nowe this Barabbas was a murtherer. 
\c 19  
\p
\v 1 Then Pilate tooke Iesus and scourged him. 
\v 2 And the souldiers platted a crowne of thornes, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple garment, 
\v 3 And saide, Haile, King of the Iewes. And they smote him with their roddes. 
\v 4 Then Pilate went foorth againe, and said vnto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may knowe, that I finde no fault in him at all. 
\v 5 Then came Iesus foorth wearing a crowne of thornes, and a purple garment. And Pilate said vnto them, Beholde the man. 
\v 6 Then when the hie Priests and officers sawe him, they cried, saying, Crucifie, crucifie him. Pilate said vnto them, Take yee him and crucifie him: for I finde no fault in him. 
\v 7 The Iewes answered him, We haue a lawe, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himselfe the Sonne of God. 
\v 8 When Pilate then heard that woorde, he was the more afraide, 
\v 9 And went againe into the common hall, and saide vnto Iesus, Whence art thou? But Iesus gaue him none answere. 
\v 10 Then saide Pilate vnto him, Speakest thou not vnto me? Knowest thou not that I haue power to crucifie thee, and haue power to loose thee? 
\v 11 Iesus answered, Thou couldest haue no power at all against me, except it were giuen thee from aboue: therefore he that deliuered me vnto thee, hath the greater sinne. 
\v 12 From thence foorth Pilate sought to loose him, but the Iewes cried, saying, If thou deliuer him, thou art not Cesars friende: for whosoeuer maketh himselfe a King, speaketh against Cesar. 
\v 13 When Pilate heard this woorde, hee brought Iesus foorth, and sate downe in the iudgement seate in a place called the Pauement, and in Hebrewe, Gabbatha. 
\v 14 And it was the Preparation of the Passeouer, and about the sixt houre: and hee sayde vnto the Iewes, Beholde your King. 
\v 15 But they cried, Away with him, away with him, crucifie him. Pilate sayde vnto them, Shall I crucifie your King? The high Priestes answered, We haue no King but Cesar. 
\v 16 Then deliuered he him vnto them, to be crucified. And they tooke Iesus, and led him away. 
\v 17 And he bare his owne crosse, and came into a place named of dead mens Skulles, which is called in Hebrewe, Golgotha: 
\v 18 Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Iesus in the middes. 
\v 19 And Pilate wrote also a title, and put it on the crosse, and it was written, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWES. 
\v 20 This title then read many of the Iewes: for the place where Iesus was crucified, was neere to the citie: and it was written in Hebrewe, Greeke and Latine. 
\v 21 Then saide the hie Priests of the Iewes to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Iewes, but that he sayd, I am King of the Iewes. 
\v 22 Pilate answered, What I haue written, I haue written. 
\v 23 Then the souldiers, when they had crucified Iesus, tooke his garments (and made foure partes, to euery souldier a part) and his coat: and the coat was without seame wouen from the toppe throughout. 
\v 24 Therefore they sayde one to another, Let vs not deuide it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be. This was that the Scripture might be fulfilled, which sayth, They parted my garments among them, and on my coate did cast lots. So the souldiers did these things in deede. 
\v 25 Then stoode by the crosse of Iesus his mother, and his mothers sister, Marie the wife of Cleopas, and Marie Magdalene. 
\v 26 And when Iesus sawe his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loued, he said vnto his mother, Woman, beholde thy sonne. 
\v 27 Then saide he to the disciple, Beholde thy mother: and from that houre, the disciple tooke her home vnto him. 
\v 28 After, when Iesus knew that all things were performed, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, he said, I thirst. 
\v 29 And there was set a vessell full of vineger: and they filled a spondge with vineger: and put it about an Hyssope stalke, and put it to his mouth. 
\v 30 Nowe when Iesus had receiued of the vineger, he saide, It is finished, and bowed his head, and gaue vp the ghost. 
\v 31 The Iewes then (because it was the Preparation, that the bodies should not remaine vpon the crosse on the Sabbath day: for that Sabbath was an hie day) besought Pilate that their legges might be broken, and that they might be taken downe. 
\v 32 Then came the souldiers and brake the legges of the first, and of the other, which was crucified with Iesus. 
\v 33 But when they came to Iesus, and saw that he was dead alreadie, they brake not his legges. 
\v 34 But one of the souldiers with a speare pearced his side, and foorthwith came there out blood and water. 
\v 35 And he that sawe it, bare recorde, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might beleeue it. 
\v 36 For these things were done, that the Scripture shoulde be fulfilled, Not a bone of him shalbe broken. 
\v 37 And againe an other Scripture saith, They shall see him whom they haue thrust through. 
\v 38 And after these things, Ioseph of Arimathea (who was a disciple of Iesus, but secretly for feare of the Iewes) besought Pilate that he might take downe the bodie of Iesus. And Pilate gaue him licence. He came then and tooke Iesus body. 
\v 39 And there came also Nicodemus (which first came to Iesus by night) and brought of myrrhe and aloes mingled together about an hundreth pound. 
\v 40 Then tooke they the body of Iesus, and wrapped it in linnen clothes with the odours, as the maner of the Iewes is to burie. 
\v 41 And in that place where Iesus was crucified, was a garden, and in the garden a newe sepulchre, wherein was neuer man yet laid. 
\v 42 There then laide they Iesus, because of the Iewes Preparation day, for the sepulchre was neere. 
\c 20  
\p
\v 1 Nowe the first day of the weeke came Marie Magdalene, early when it was yet darke, vnto the sepulchre, and sawe the stone taken away from the tombe. 
\v 2 Then she ranne, and came to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Iesus loued, and saide vnto them, They haue taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we knowe not where they haue laid him. 
\v 3 Peter therefore went forth, and the other disciple, and they came vnto the sepulchre. 
\v 4 So they ranne both together, but the other disciple did outrunne Peter, and came first to the sepulchre. 
\v 5 And he stouped downe, and sawe the linnen clothes lying: yet went he not in. 
\v 6 Then came Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and sawe the linnen clothes lye, 
\v 7 And the kerchiefe that was vpon his head, not lying with the linnen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by it selfe. 
\v 8 Then went in also the other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he sawe it, and beleeued. 
\v 9 For as yet they knewe not the Scripture, That he must rise againe from the dead. 
\v 10 And the disciples went away againe vnto their owne home. 
\v 11 But Marie stoode without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she bowed her selfe into the sepulchre, 
\v 12 And sawe two Angels in white, sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feete, where the body of Iesus had laien. 
\v 13 And they said vnto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She said vnto them, They haue taken away my Lord, and I know not where they haue laide him. 
\v 14 When she had thus said, she turned her selfe backe, and sawe Iesus standing, and knewe not that it was Iesus. 
\v 15 Iesus saith vnto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She supposing that he had bene the gardener, said vnto him, Sir, if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away. 
\v 16 Iesus saith vnto her, Marie. She turned her selfe, and said vnto him, Rabboni, which is to say, Master. 
\v 17 Iesus saith vnto her, Touch me not: for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but goe to my brethren, and say vnto them, I ascend vnto my Father, and to your Father, and to my God, and your God. 
\v 18 Marie Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seene the Lord, and that he had spoken these things vnto her. 
\v 19 The same day then at night, which was the first day of the weeke, and when the doores were shut where the disciples were assembled for feare of the Iewes, came Iesus and stoode in the middes, and saide to them, Peace be vnto you. 
\v 20 And when he had so saide, he shewed vnto them his handes, and his side. Then were the disciples glad when they had seene the Lord. 
\v 21 Then saide Iesus to them againe, Peace be vnto you: as my Father sent me, so sende I you. 
\v 22 And when he had saide that, he breathed on them, and saide vnto them, Receiue the holy Ghost. 
\v 23 Whosoeuers sinnes ye remit, they are remitted vnto them: and whosoeuers sinnes ye reteine, they are reteined. 
\v 24 But Thomas one of the twelue, called Didymus, was not with them when Iesus came. 
\v 25 The other disciples therefore saide vnto him, We haue seene the Lord: but he said vnto them, Except I see in his handes the print of the nailes, and put my finger into the print of the nailes, and put mine hand into his side, I will not beleeue it. 
\v 26 And eight dayes after, againe his disciples were within, and Thomas with them. Then came Iesus, when the doores were shut, and stood in the middes, and said, Peace be vnto you. 
\v 27 After saide he to Thomas, Put thy finger here, and see mine hands, and put forth thine hand, and put it into my side, and be not faithlesse, but faithfull. 
\v 28 Then Thomas answered, and said vnto him, Thou art my Lord, and my God. 
\v 29 Iesus said vnto him, Thomas, because thou hast seene me, thou beleeuest: blessed are they that haue not seene, and haue beleeued. 
\v 30 And many other signes also did Iesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this booke. 
\v 31 But these things are written, that ye might beleeue, that Iesus is that Christ that Sonne of God, and that in beleeuing ye might haue life through his Name. 
\c 21  
\p
\v 1 After these things, Iesus shewed himselfe againe to his disciples at the sea of Tiberias: and thus shewed he himselfe: 
\v 2 There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas, which is called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galile, and the sonnes of Zebedeus, and two other of his disciples. 
\v 3 Simon Peter said vnto them, I go a fishing. They said vnto him, We also will goe with thee. They went their way and entred into a ship straightway, and that night caught they nothing. 
\v 4 But when the morning was nowe come, Iesus stoode on the shore: neuerthelesse the disciples knewe not that it was Iesus. 
\v 5 Iesus then said vnto them, Syrs, haue ye any meate? They answered him, No. 
\v 6 Then he said vnto them, Cast out the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall finde. So they cast out, and they were not able at all to draw it, for the multitude of fishes. 
\v 7 Therefore said the disciple whom Iesus loued, vnto Peter, It is the Lord. When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girded his coate to him (for he was naked) and cast himselfe into the sea. 
\v 8 But the other disciples came by shippe (for they were not farre from land, but about two hundreth cubites) and they drewe the net with fishes. 
\v 9 Assoone then as they were come to land, they sawe hoate coales, and fish laide thereon, and bread. 
\v 10 Iesus saide vnto them, Bring of the fishes, which ye haue nowe caught. 
\v 11 Simon Peter stepped foorth and drewe the net to land, full of great fishes, an hundreth, fiftie and three: and albeit there were so many, yet was not the net broken. 
\v 12 Iesus saide vnto them, Come, and dine. And none of the disciples durst aske him, Who art thou? seeing they knewe that he was the Lord. 
\v 13 Iesus then came and tooke bread, and gaue them, and fish likewise. 
\v 14 This is now the third time that Iesus shewed himselfe to his disciples, after that he was risen againe from the dead. 
\v 15 So when they had dined, Iesus said to Simon Peter, Simon the sonne of Iona, louest thou me more then these? He said vnto him, Yea Lord, thou knowest that I loue thee. He said vnto him, Feede my lambes. 
\v 16 He said to him againe the second time, Simon the sonne of Iona, louest thou me? He said vnto him, Yea Lord, thou knowest that I loue thee. He said vnto him, Feede my sheepe. 
\v 17 He said vnto him the third time, Simon the sonne of Iona, louest thou me? Peter was sorie because he said to him the third time, Louest thou me? and said vnto him, Lord, thou knowest all things: thou knowest that I loue thee. Iesus saide vnto him, Feede my sheepe. 
\v 18 Verely, verely I say vnto thee, When thou wast yong, thou girdedst thy selfe, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be olde, thou shalt stretch foorth thine hands, and another shall gird thee, and lead thee whither thou wouldest not. 
\v 19 And this spake he signifying by what death he shoulde glorifie God. And when he had said this, he said to him, Folowe me. 
\v 20 Then Peter turned about, and sawe the disciple whom JESUS loued, folowing, which had also leaned on his breast at supper, and had saide, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee? 
\v 21 When Peter therefore sawe him, he saide to Iesus, Lord, what shall this man doe? 
\v 22 Iesus said vnto him, If I will that he tarie till I come, what is it to thee? follow thou me. 
\v 23 Then went this worde abroade among the brethren, that this disciple shoulde not die. Yet Iesus saide not to him, He shall not die: but if I will that he tarie till I come, what is it to thee? 
\v 24 This is that disciple, which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things, and we know that his testimonie is true. 
\v 25 Nowe there are also many other things which Iesus did, the which if they should be written euery one, I suppose the world coulde not conteine the bookes that shoulde be written, Amen.
