\v 1 Blessed is the man that doeth not walke in the counsell of the wicked, nor stand in the way of sinners, nor sit in ye seate of the scornefull: 
\v 2 But his delite is in the Lawe of the Lord, and in his Lawe doeth he meditate day and night. 
\v 3 For he shall be like a tree planted by the riuers of waters, that will bring foorth her fruite in due season: whose leafe shall not fade: so whatsoeuer he shall doe, shall prosper. 
\v 4 The wicked are not so, but as the chaffe, which the winde driueth away. 
\v 5 Therefore the wicked shall not stande in the iudgement, nor sinners in the assemblie of the righteous. 
\v 6 For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous, and the way of the wicked shall perish. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 Why doe the heathen rage, and the people murmure in vaine? 
\v 2 The Kings of the earth band themselues, and the princes are assembled together against the Lord, and against his Christ. 
\v 3 Let vs breake their bands, and cast their cordes from vs. 
\v 4 But he that dwelleth in the heauen, shall laugh: the Lord shall haue them in derision. 
\v 5 Then shall hee speake vnto them in his wrath, and vexe them in his sore displeasure, saying, 
\v 6 Euen I haue set my King vpon Zion mine holy mountaine. 
\v 7 I will declare the decree: that is, the Lord hath said vnto me, Thou art my Sonne: this day haue I begotten thee. 
\v 8 Aske of me, and I shall giue thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the endes of the earth for thy possession. 
\v 9 Thou shalt krush them with a scepter of yron, and breake them in pieces like a potters vessell. 
\v 10 Be wise nowe therefore, ye Kings: be learned ye Iudges of the earth. 
\v 11 Serue the Lord in feare, and reioyce in trembling. 
\v 12 Kisse the sonne, least he be angry, and ye perish in the way, when his wrath shall suddenly burne. blessed are all that trust in him.

\v 1 A Psalme of Dauid, when he fled from his sonne Absalom. Lord, howe are mine aduersaries increased? howe many rise against me? 
\v 2 Many say to my soule, There is no helpe for him in God. Selah. 
\v 3 But thou Lord art a buckler for me: my glory, and the lifter vp of mine head. 
\v 4 I did call vnto the Lord with my voyce, and he heard me out of his holy mountaine. Selah. 
\v 5 I layed me downe and slept, and rose vp againe: for the Lord susteined me. 
\v 6 I will not be afrayde for ten thousand of the people, that should beset me round about. 
\v 7 O Lord, arise: helpe me, my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies vpon the cheeke bone: thou hast broken the teeth of the wicked. 
\v 8 Saluation belongeth vnto the Lord, and thy blessing is vpon thy people. Selah. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 To him that excelleth on Neginoth. A Psalme of Dauid. Heare me when I call, O God of my righteousnes: thou hast set me at libertie, when I was in distresse: haue mercie vpon me and hearken vnto my prayer. 
\v 2 O ye sonnes of men, howe long will yee turne my glory into shame, louing vanitie, and seeking lyes? Selah. 
\v 3 For be ye sure that the Lord hath chosen to himselfe a godly man: the Lord will heare when I call vnto him. 
\v 4 Tremble, and sinne not: examine your owne heart vpon your bed, and be still. Selah. 
\v 5 Offer the sacrifices of righteousnes, and trust in the Lord. 
\v 6 Many say, Who will shewe vs any good? but Lord, lift vp the light of thy countenance vpon vs. 
\v 7 Thou hast giuen mee more ioye of heart, then they haue had, when their wheate and their wine did abound. 
\v 8 I will lay mee downe, and also sleepe in peace: for thou, Lord, onely makest me dwell in safetie. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 To him that excelleth upon Nehiloth. A Psalme of Dauid. Heare my wordes, O Lord: vnderstande my meditation. 
\v 2 Hearken vnto the voyce of my crie, my King and my God: for vnto thee doe I pray. 
\v 3 Heare my voyce in the morning, O Lord: for in the morning will I direct me vnto thee, and I will waite. 
\v 4 For thou art not a God that loueth wickednes: neither shall euill dwell with thee. 
\v 5 The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: for thou hatest all them that worke iniquitie. 
\v 6 Thou shalt destroy them that speake lyes: the Lord will abhorre the bloodie man and deceitfull. 
\v 7 But I wil come into thine house in the multitude of thy mercie: and in thy feare will I worship toward thine holy Temple. 
\v 8 Leade me, O Lord, in thy righteousnes, because of mine enemies: make thy way plaine before my face. 
\v 9 For no constancie is in their mouth: within, they are very corruption: their throte is an open sepulchre, and they flatter with their tongue. 
\v 10 Destroy them, O God: let them fall from their counsels: cast them out for the multitude of their iniquities, because they haue rebelled against thee. 
\v 11 And let all them that trust in thee, reioyce and triumph for euer, and couer thou them: and let them, that loue thy Name, reioyce in thee. 
\v 12 For thou Lord wilt blesse the righteous, and with fauour wilt compasse him, as with a shielde. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1 To him that excelleth on Neginoth upon the eith tune. A Psalme of Dauid. O lord, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chastise me in thy wrath. 
\v 2 Haue mercie vpon me, O Lord, for I am weake: O Lord heale me, for my bones are vexed. 
\v 3 My soule is also sore troubled: but Lord how long wilt thou delay? 
\v 4 Returne, O Lord: deliuer my soule: saue me for thy mercies sake. 
\v 5 For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the graue who shall prayse thee? 
\v 6 I fainted in my mourning: I cause my bed euery night to swimme, and water my couch with my teares. 
\v 7 Mine eye is dimmed for despight, and sunke in because of all mine enemies. 
\v 8 Away from mee all ye workers of iniquitie: for the Lord hath heard the voyce of my weeping. 
\v 9 The Lord hath heard my petition: the Lord will receiue my prayer. 
\v 10 All mine enemies shall be confounded and sore vexed: they shall be turned backe, and put to shame suddenly. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1 Shigaion of Dauid, which he sang unto the Lord, concerning the wordes of Chush the sonne of Iemini. O Lord my God, in thee I put my trust: saue me from all that persecute me, and deliuer me, 
\v 2 Least he deuoure my soule like a lion, and teare it in pieces, while there is none to helpe. 
\v 3 O Lord my God, if I haue done this thing, if there be any wickednes in mine handes, 
\v 4 If I haue rewarded euill vnto him that had peace with mee, (yea I haue deliuered him that vexed me without cause) 
\v 5 Then let the enemie persecute my soule and take it: yea, let him treade my life downe vpon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah. 
\v 6 Arise, O Lord, in thy wrath, and lift vp thy selfe against the rage of mine enemies, and awake for mee according to the iudgement that thou hast appointed. 
\v 7 So shall the Congregation of the people compasse thee about: for their sakes therefore returne on hie. 
\v 8 The Lord shall iudge the people: Iudge thou me, O Lord, according to my righteousnesse, and according to mine innocencie, that is in mee. 
\v 9 Oh let the malice of the wicked come to an ende: but guide thou the iust: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reines. 
\v 10 My defence is in God, who preserueth the vpright in heart. 
\v 11 God iudgeth the righteous, and him that contemneth God euery day. 
\v 12 Except he turne, he hath whet his sword: he hath bent his bowe and made it readie. 
\v 13 Hee hath also prepared him deadly weapons: hee will ordeine his arrowes for them that persecute me. 
\v 14 Beholde, hee shall trauaile with wickednes: for he hath conceiued mischiefe, but he shall bring foorth a lye. 
\v 15 Hee hath made a pitte and digged it, and is fallen into the pit that he made. 
\v 16 His mischiefe shall returne vpon his owne head, and his crueltie shall fall vpon his owne pate. 
\v 17 I wil praise the Lord according to his righteousnes, and will sing praise to the Name of the Lord most high. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1 To him that excelleth on Gittith. A Psalme of Dauid. O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy Name in all the worlde! which hast set thy glory aboue the heauens. 
\v 2 Out of the mouth of babes and suckelings hast thou ordeined strength, because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemie and the auenger. 
\v 3 When I beholde thine heauens, euen the workes of thy fingers, the moone and the starres which thou hast ordeined, 
\v 4 What is man, say I, that thou art mindefull of him? and the sonne of man, that thou visitest him? 
\v 5 For thou hast made him a little lower then God, and crowned him with glory and worship. 
\v 6 Thou hast made him to haue dominion in the workes of thine hands: thou hast put all things vnder his feete: 
\v 7 All sheepe and oxen: yea, and the beastes of the fielde: 
\v 8 The foules of the ayre, and the fish of the sea, and that which passeth through the paths of the seas. 
\v 9 O Lord our Lord, howe excellent is thy Name in all the world! 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 To him that excelleth vpon Muth Laben. A Psalme of Dauid. I will praise the Lord with my whole heart: I will speake of all thy marueilous workes. 
\v 2 I will bee glad, and reioyce in thee: I will sing praise to thy Name, O most High, 
\v 3 For that mine enemies are turned backe: they shall fall, and perish at thy presence. 
\v 4 For thou hast maintained my right and my cause: thou art set in the throne, and iudgest right. 
\v 5 Thou hast rebuked the heathen: thou hast destroyed the wicked: thou hast put out their name for euer and euer. 
\v 6 O enemie, destructions are come to a perpetual end, and thou hast destroyed the cities: their memoriall is perished with them. 
\v 7 But the Lord shall sit for euer: hee hath prepared his throne for iudgement. 
\v 8 For he shall iudge the worlde in righteousnes, and shall iudge the people with equitie. 
\v 9 The Lord also wil be a refuge for the poore, a refuge in due time, euen in affliction. 
\v 10 And they that know thy Name, will trust in thee: for thou, Lord, hast not failed them that seeke thee. 
\v 11 Sing praises to the Lord, which dwelleth in Zion: shewe the people his workes. 
\v 12 For whe he maketh inquisition for blood, hee remembreth it, and forgetteth not the complaint of the poore. 
\v 13 Haue mercie vpon mee, O Lord: consider my trouble which I suffer of them that hate mee, thou that liftest me vp from the gates of death, 
\v 14 That I may shewe all thy praises within the gates of the daughter of Zion, and reioyce in thy saluation. 
\v 15 The heathen are sunken downe in the pit that they made: in the nette that they hid, is their foote taken. 
\v 16 The Lord is knowen by executing iudgement: the wicked is snared in the worke of his owne handes. Higgaion. Selah. 
\v 17 The wicked shall turne into hell, and all nations that forget God. 
\v 18 For the poore shall not bee alway forgotten: the hope of the afflicted shall not perish for euer. 
\v 19 Vp Lord: let not man preuaile: let the heathen be iudged in thy sight. 
\v 20 Put them in feare, O Lord, that the heathen may knowe that they are but men. Selah. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1 Why standest thou farre off, O Lord, and hidest thee in due time, euen in affliction? 
\v 2 The wicked with pride doeth persecute the poore: let them be taken in the craftes that they haue imagined. 
\v 3 For the wicked hath made boast of his owne heartes desire, and the couetous blesseth himselfe: he contemneth the Lord. 
\v 4 The wicked is so proude that hee seeketh not for God: hee thinketh alwayes, There is no God. 
\v 5 His wayes alway prosper: thy iudgements are hie aboue his sight: therefore defieth he all his enemies. 
\v 6 He saith in his heart, I shall neuer be moued, nor be in danger. 
\v 7 His mouth is full of cursing and deceite and fraude: vnder his tongue is mischiefe and iniquitie. 
\v 8 He lieth in waite in the villages: in the secret places doeth hee murder the innocent: his eyes are bent against the poore. 
\v 9 He lyeth in waite secretly, euen as a lyon in his denne: he lyeth in waite to spoyle the poore: he doeth spoyle the poore, when he draweth him into his net. 
\v 10 He croucheth and boweth: therefore heaps of the poore doe fall by his might. 
\v 11 He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten, he hideth away his face, and will neuer see. 
\v 12 Arise, O Lord God: lift vp thine hande: forget not the poore. 
\v 13 Wherefore doeth the wicked contemne God? he saith in his heart, Thou wilt not regard. 
\v 14 Yet thou hast seene it: for thou beholdest mischiefe and wrong, that thou mayest take it into thine handes: the poore committeth himselfe vnto thee: for thou art the helper of the fatherlesse. 
\v 15 Breake thou the arme of the wicked and malicious: searche his wickednes, and thou shalt finde none. 
\v 16 The Lord is King for euer and euer: the heathen are destroyed foorth of his land. 
\v 17 Lord, thou hast heard the desire of the poore: thou preparest their heart: thou bendest thine eare to them, 
\v 18 To iudge the fatherlesse and poore, that earthly man cause to feare no more. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 To him that excelleth. A Psalme of Dauid. In the Lord put I my trust: howe say yee then to my soule, Flee to your mountaine as a birde? 
\v 2 For loe, the wicked bende their bowe, and make readie their arrowes vpon the string, that they may secretly shoote at them, which are vpright in heart. 
\v 3 For the foundations are cast downe: what hath the righteous done? 
\v 4 The Lord is in his holy palace: the Lordes throne is in the heauen: his eyes wil consider: his eye lids will try the children of men. 
\v 5 The Lord will try the righteous: but the wicked and him that loueth iniquitie, doeth his soule hate. 
\v 6 Vpon the wicked he shall raine snares, fire, and brimstone, and stormie tempest: this is the porcion of their cup. 
\v 7 For the righteous Lord loueth righteousnes: his countenance doeth beholde the iust. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 To him that excelleth upon the eight tune. A Psalme of Dauid. Helpe Lord, for there is not a godly man left: for the faithfull are fayled from among the children of men. 
\v 2 They speake deceitfully euery one with his neighbour, flattering with their lips, and speake with a double heart. 
\v 3 The Lord cut off all flattering lippes, and the tongue that speaketh proude things: 
\v 4 Which haue saide, With our tongue will we preuaile: our lippes are our owne: who is Lord ouer vs? 
\v 5 Now for the oppression of the needy, and for the sighes of the poore, I will vp, sayeth the Lord, and will set at libertie him, whom the wicked hath snared. 
\v 6 The wordes of the Lord are pure wordes, as the siluer, tried in a fornace of earth, fined seuen folde. 
\v 7 Thou wilt keepe them, O Lord: thou wilt preserue him from this generation for euer. 
\v 8 The wicked walke on euery side: when they are exalted, it is a shame for the sonnes of men. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 To him that excelleth. A Psalme of Dauid. Howe long wilt thou forget me, O Lord, for euer? howe long wilt thou hide thy face from me? 
\v 2 How long shall I take counsell within my selfe, hauing wearinesse dayly in mine heart? how long shall mine enemie be exalted aboue me? 
\v 3 Beholde, and heare mee, O Lord my God: lighten mine eyes, that I sleepe not in death: 
\v 4 Lest mine enemie say, I haue preuailed against him: and they that afflict me, reioyce when I slide. 
\v 5 But I trust in thy mercie: mine heart shall reioyce in thy saluation: I will sing to the Lord, because he hath delt louingly with me. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1 To him that excelleth. A Psalme of Dauid. The foole hath said in his heart, There is no God: they haue corrupted, and done an abominable worke: there is none that doeth good. 
\v 2 The Lord looked downe from heauen vpon the children of men, to see if there were any that would vnderstand, and seeke God. 
\v 3 All are gone out of the way: they are all corrupt: there is none that doeth good, no not one. 
\v 4 Doe not all the workers of iniquitie know that they eate vp my people, as they eate bread? they call not vpon the Lord. 
\v 5 There they shall be taken with feare, because God is in the generation of the iust. 
\v 6 You haue made a mocke at the counsell of the poore, because the Lord is his trust. 
\v 7 Oh giue saluation vnto Israel out of Zion: when the Lord turneth the captiuitie of his people, then Iaakob shall reioyce, and Israel shall be glad. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1 A Psalme of Dauid. Lord, who shall dwell in thy Tabernacle? who shall rest in thine holy Mountaine? 
\v 2 He that walketh vprightly and worketh righteousnes, and speaketh the trueth in his heart. 
\v 3 He that slandereth not with his tongue, nor doeth euill to his neighbour, nor receiueth a false report against his neighbour. 
\v 4 In whose eyes a vile person is contemned, but he honoureth them that feare the Lord: he that sweareth to his owne hinderance and changeth not. 
\v 5 He that giueth not his money vnto vsurie, nor taketh reward against the innocent: hee that doeth these things, shall neuer be moued. 
\c 16  
\p
\v 1 Michtam of Dauid. Preserue mee, O God: for in thee doe I trust. 
\v 2 O my soule, thou hast sayd vnto the Lord, Thou art my Lord: my weldoing extendeth not to thee, 
\v 3 But to the Saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent: all my delite is in them. 
\v 4 The sorowes of them, that offer to an other god, shall be multiplied: their offerings of blood will I not offer, neither make mention of their names with my lips. 
\v 5 The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou shalt mainteine my lot. 
\v 6 The lines are fallen vnto me in pleasant places: yea, I haue a faire heritage. 
\v 7 I wil prayse the Lord, who hath giuen me counsell: my reines also teach me in the nightes. 
\v 8 I haue set the Lord alwayes before me: for hee is at my right hand: therefore I shall not slide. 
\v 9 Wherefore mine heart is glad and my tongue reioyceth: my flesh also doeth rest in hope. 
\v 10 For thou wilt not leaue my soule in the graue: neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption. 
\v 11 Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is the fulnesse of ioy: and at thy right hand there are pleasures for euermore. 
\c 17  
\p
\v 1 The prayer of Dauid. Heare the right, O Lord, consider my crye: hearken vnto my prayer of lips vnfained. 
\v 2 Let my sentence come forth from thy presence, and let thine eyes beholde equitie. 
\v 3 Thou hast prooued and visited mine heart in the night: thou hast tryed me, and foundest nothing: for I was purposed that my mouth should not offend. 
\v 4 Concerning the workes of men, by the wordes of thy lips I kept mee from the paths of the cruell man. 
\v 5 Stay my steps in thy paths, that my feete doe not slide. 
\v 6 I haue called vpon thee: surely thou wilt heare me, O God: incline thine eare to me, and hearken vnto my wordes. 
\v 7 Shewe thy marueilous mercies, thou that art the Sauiour of them that trust in thee, from such as resist thy right hand. 
\v 8 Keepe me as the apple of the eye: hide me vnder the shadowe of thy wings, 
\v 9 From the wicked that oppresse mee, from mine enemies, which compasse me round about for my soule. 
\v 10 They are inclosed in their owne fat, and they haue spoken proudely with their mouth. 
\v 11 They haue compassed vs now in our steps: they haue set their eyes to bring downe to the ground: 
\v 12 Like as a lyon that is greedy of pray, and as it were a lyons whelp lurking in secret places. 
\v 13 Vp Lord, disappoint him: cast him downe: deliuer my soule from the wicked with thy sworde, 
\v 14 From men by thine hand, O Lord, from men of the world, who haue their portion in this life, whose bellies thou fillest with thine hid treasure: their children haue ynough, and leaue the rest of their substance for their children. 
\v 15 But I will beholde thy face in righteousnes, and when I awake, I shalbe satisfied with thine image. 
\c 18  
\p
\v 1 To him that excelleth. A Psalme of Dauid the seruant of the Lord, which spake unto the Lord the wordes of this song (in the day that the Lord delivered him for the hande of all this enemies, and form the and of saul) and sayd, I will loue thee dearely, O Lord my strength. 
\v 2 The Lord is my rocke, and my fortresse, and he that deliuereth me, my God and my strength: in him will I trust, my shield, the horne also of my saluation, and my refuge. 
\v 3 I will call vpon the Lord, which is worthie to be praysed: so shall I be safe from mine enemies. 
\v 4 The sorowes of death compassed me, and the floods of wickednes made me afraide. 
\v 5 The sorowes of the graue haue compassed me about: the snares of death ouertooke me. 
\v 6 But in my trouble did I call vpon the Lord, and cryed vnto my God: he heard my voyce out of his Temple, and my crye did come before him, euen into his eares. 
\v 7 Then the earth trembled, and quaked: the foundations also of the mountaines mooued and shooke, because he was angrie. 
\v 8 Smoke went out at his nostrels, and a consuming fire out of his mouth: coales were kindled thereat. 
\v 9 He bowed the heauens also and came downe, and darkenes was vnder his feete. 
\v 10 And he rode vpon Cherub and did flie, and he came flying vpon the wings of the winde. 
\v 11 He made darkenes his secrete place, and his pauilion round about him, euen darkenesse of waters, and cloudes of the ayre. 
\v 12 At the brightnes of his presence his clouds passed, haylestones and coles of fire. 
\v 13 The Lord also thundred in the heauen, and the Highest gaue his voyce, haylestones and coales of fire. 
\v 14 Then hee sent out his arrowes and scattred them, and he increased lightnings and destroyed them. 
\v 15 And the chanels of waters were seene, and the foundations of the worlde were discouered at thy rebuking, O Lord, at the blasting of the breath of thy nostrels. 
\v 16 He hath sent downe from aboue and taken mee: hee hath drawen mee out of many waters. 
\v 17 He hath deliuered mee from my strong enemie, and from them which hate me: for they were too strong for me. 
\v 18 They preuented me in the day of my calamitie: but the Lord was my stay. 
\v 19 Hee brought mee foorth also into a large place: hee deliuered mee because hee fauoured me. 
\v 20 The Lord rewarded me according to my righteousnes: according to the purenes of mine hands he recompensed me: 
\v 21 Because I kept the wayes of the Lord, and did not wickedly against my God. 
\v 22 For all his Lawes were before mee, and I did not cast away his commandements from mee. 
\v 23 I was vpright also with him, and haue kept me from my wickednes. 
\v 24 Therefore the Lord rewarded me according to my righteousnesse, and according to the purenes of mine hands in his sight. 
\v 25 With the godly thou wilt shewe thy selfe godly: with the vpright man thou wilt shew thy selfe vpright. 
\v 26 With the pure thou wilt shewe thy selfe pure, and with the froward thou wilt shewe thy selfe froward. 
\v 27 Thus thou wilt saue the poore people, and wilt cast downe the proude lookes. 
\v 28 Surely thou wilt light my candle: the Lord my God wil lighten my darkenes. 
\v 29 For by thee I haue broken through an hoste, and by my God I haue leaped ouer a wall. 
\v 30 The way of God is vncorrupt: the worde of the Lord is tried in the fire: he is a shield to all that trust in him. 
\v 31 For who is God besides the Lord? and who is mightie saue our God? 
\v 32 God girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way vpright. 
\v 33 He maketh my feete like hindes feete, and setteth me vpon mine high places. 
\v 34 He teacheth mine hands to fight: so that a bowe of brasse is broken with mine armes. 
\v 35 Thou hast also giuen me the shield of thy saluation, and thy right hand hath stayed me, and thy louing kindenes hath caused me to increase. 
\v 36 Thou hast enlarged my steps vnder mee, and mine heeles haue not slid. 
\v 37 I haue pursued mine enemies, and taken them, and haue not turned againe till I had consumed them. 
\v 38 I haue wounded them, that they were not able to rise: they are fallen vnder my feete. 
\v 39 For thou hast girded me with strength to battell: them, that rose against me, thou hast subdued vnder me. 
\v 40 And thou hast giuen me the neckes of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me. 
\v 41 They cryed but there was none to saue them, euen vnto the Lord, but hee answered them not. 
\v 42 Then I did beate them small as the dust before the winde: I did treade them flat as the clay in the streetes. 
\v 43 Thou hast deliuered me from the contentions of the people: thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people, whom I haue not knowen, shall serue me. 
\v 44 As soone as they heare, they shall obey me: the strangers shall be in subiection to me. 
\v 45 Strangers shall shrinke away, and feare in their priuie chambers. 
\v 46 Let the Lord liue, and blessed be my strength, and the God of my saluation be exalted. 
\v 47 It is God that giueth me power to auenge me, and subdueth the people vnder me. 
\v 48 O my deliuerer from mine enemies, euen thou hast set mee vp from them, that rose against me: thou hast deliuered mee from the cruell man. 
\v 49 Therefore I will prayse thee, O Lord, among the nations, and wil sing vnto thy Name. 
\v 50 Great deliuerances giueth hee vnto his King, and sheweth mercie to his anoynted, euen to Dauid, and to his seede for euer. 
\c 19  
\p
\v 1 To him that excelleth. A Psalme of Dauid. The heauens declare the glory of God, and the firmament sheweth ye worke of his hands. 
\v 2 Day vnto day vttereth the same, and night vnto night teacheth knowledge. 
\v 3 There is no speach nor language, where their voyce is not heard. 
\v 4 Their line is gone forth through all the earth, and their words into the endes of the world: in them hath he set a tabernacle for the sunne. 
\v 5 Which commeth forth as a bridegrome out of his chamber, and reioyceth like a mightie man to runne his race. 
\v 6 His going out is from the ende of the heauen, and his compasse is vnto the endes of ye same, and none is hid from the heate thereof. 
\v 7 The Lawe of the Lord is perfite, conuerting the soule: the testimonie of the Lord is sure, and giueth wisedome vnto the simple. 
\v 8 The statutes of the Lord are right and reioyce the heart: the commandement of the Lord is pure, and giueth light vnto the eyes. 
\v 9 The feare of the Lord is cleane, and indureth for euer: the iudgements of the Lord are trueth: they are righteous altogether, 
\v 10 And more to be desired then golde, yea, then much fine golde: sweeter also then honie and the honie combe. 
\v 11 Moreouer by them is thy seruant made circumspect, and in keeping of them there is great reward. 
\v 12 Who can vnderstand his faultes? clense me from secret fautes. 
\v 13 Keepe thy seruant also from presumptuous sinnes: let them not reigne ouer me: so shall I be vpright, and made cleane from much wickednes. 
\v 14 Let the wordes of my mouth, and the meditation of mine heart be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord, my strength, and my redeemer.

\v 1 To him that excelleth. A Psalme of Dauid. The Lord heare thee in the day of trouble: the name of ye God of Iaakob defend thee: 
\v 2 Send thee helpe from the Sanctuarie, and strengthen thee out of Zion. 
\v 3 Let him remember all thine offerings, and turne thy burnt offerings into asshes. Selah: 
\v 4 And graunt thee according to thine heart, and fulfill all thy purpose: 
\v 5 That we may reioyce in thy saluation, and set vp the banner in the Name of our God, when the Lord shall performe all thy petitions. 
\v 6 Now know I that the Lord will helpe his anointed, and will heare him from his Sanctuarie, by the mightie helpe of his right hand. 
\v 7 Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the Name of ye Lord our God. 
\v 8 They are brought downe and fallen, but we are risen, and stand vpright. 
\v 9 Saue Lord: let the King heare vs in the day that we call.

\v 1 To him that excelleth. A Psalme of Dauid. The King shall reioyce in thy strength, O Lord: yea how greatly shall he reioyce in thy saluation! 
\v 2 Thou hast giuen him his hearts desire, and hast not denyed him the request of his lips. Selah. 
\v 3 For thou diddest preuent him with liberall blessings, and didest set a crowne of pure gold vpon his head. 
\v 4 He asked life of thee, and thou gauest him a long life for euer and euer. 
\v 5 His glory is great in thy saluation: dignitie and honour hast thou laid vpon him. 
\v 6 For thou hast set him as blessings for euer: thou hast made him glad with the ioy of thy countenance. 
\v 7 Because the King trusteth in the Lord, and in the mercie of the most High, he shall not slide. 
\v 8 Thine hand shall finde out all thine enemies, and thy right hand shall finde out them that hate thee. 
\v 9 Thou shalt make them like a fierie ouen in time of thine anger: the Lord shall destroy them in his wrath, and the fire shall deuoure them. 
\v 10 Their fruite shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seede from the children of men. 
\v 11 For they intended euill against thee, and imagined mischiefe, but they shall not preuaile. 
\v 12 Therefore shalt thou put them aparte, and the strings of thy bowe shalt thou make readie against their faces. 
\v 13 Be thou exalted, O Lord, in thy strength: so will we sing and prayse thy power.

\v 1 To him that excelleth upon Aiieleth Hasshahar. A Psalme of Dauid. My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me, and art so farre from mine health, and from the wordes of my roaring? 
\v 2 O my God, I crie by day, but thou hearest not, and by night, but haue no audience. 
\v 3 But thou art holy, and doest inhabite the prayses of Israel. 
\v 4 Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didest deliuer them. 
\v 5 They called vpon thee, and were deliuered: they trusted in thee, and were not confounded. 
\v 6 But I am a worme, and not a man: a shame of men, and the contempt of the people. 
\v 7 All they that see me, haue me in derision: they make a mowe and nod the head, saying, 
\v 8 He trusted in the Lord, let him deliuer him: let him saue him, seeing he loueth him. 
\v 9 But thou didest draw me out of ye wombe: thou gauest me hope, euen at my mothers breasts. 
\v 10 I was cast vpon thee, euen from ye wombe: thou art my God from my mothers belly. 
\v 11 Be not farre from me, because trouble is neere: for there is none to helpe me. 
\v 12 Many yong bulles haue compassed me: mightie bulles of Bashan haue closed me about. 
\v 13 They gape vpon me with their mouthes, as a ramping and roaring lyon. 
\v 14 I am like water powred out, and all my bones are out of ioynt: mine heart is like waxe: it is molten in the middes of my bowels. 
\v 15 My strength is dryed vp like a potsheard, and my tongue cleaueth to my iawes, and thou hast brought me into the dust of death. 
\v 16 For dogges haue compassed me, and the assemblie of the wicked haue inclosed me: they perced mine hands and my feete. 
\v 17 I may tell all my bones: yet they beholde, and looke vpon me. 
\v 18 They part my garments among them, and cast lottes vpon my vesture. 
\v 19 But be thou not farre off, O Lord, my strength: hasten to helpe me. 
\v 20 Deliuer my soule from the sword: my desolate soule from the power of the dogge. 
\v 21 Saue me from the lyons mouth, and answere me in sauing me from the hornes of the vnicornes. 
\v 22 I wil declare thy Name vnto my brethren: in the middes of the Congregation will I praise thee, saying, 
\v 23 Prayse the Lord, ye that feare him: magnifie ye him, all the seede of Iaakob, and feare ye him, all the seede of Israel. 
\v 24 For he hath not despised nor abhorred ye affliction of the poore: neither hath he hid his face from him, but when he called vnto him, he heard. 
\v 25 My prayse shalbe of thee in the great Congregation: my vowes will I perfourme before them that feare him. 
\v 26 The poore shall eate and be satisfied: they that seeke after the Lord, shall prayse him: your heart shall liue for euer. 
\v 27 All the endes of the worlde shall remember themselues, and turne to the Lord: and all the kinreds of the nations shall worship before thee. 
\v 28 For the kingdome is the Lords, and he ruleth among the nations. 
\v 29 All they that be fat in the earth, shall eate and worship: all they that go downe into the dust, shall bowe before him, euen he that cannot quicken his owne soule. 
\v 30 Their seede shall serue him: it shalbe counted vnto the Lord for a generation. 
\v 31 They shall come, and shall declare his righteousnesse vnto a people that shall be borne, because he hath done it.

\v 1 A Psalme of David. The Lord is my shepheard, I shall not want. 
\v 2 He maketh me to rest in greene pasture, and leadeth me by the still waters. 
\v 3 He restoreth my soule, and leadeth me in the paths of righteousnesse for his Names sake. 
\v 4 Yea, though I should walke through the valley of the shadowe of death, I will feare no euill: for thou art with me: thy rod and thy staffe, they comfort me. 
\v 5 Thou doest prepare a table before me in the sight of mine aduersaries: thou doest anoynt mine head with oyle, and my cuppe runneth ouer. 
\v 6 Doubtlesse kindnesse and mercie shall follow me all the dayes of my life, and I shall remaine a long season in the house of the Lord.

\v 1 A Psalme of David. The earth is the Lordes, and all that therein is: the worlde and they that dwell therein. 
\v 2 For he hath founded it vpon the seas: and established it vpon the floods. 
\v 3 Who shall ascende into the mountaine of the Lord? and who shall stand in his holy place? 
\v 4 Euen he that hath innocent handes, and a pure heart: which hath not lift vp his minde vnto vanitie, nor sworne deceitfully. 
\v 5 He shall receiue a blessing from the Lord, and righteousnesse from the God of his saluation. 
\v 6 This is the generation of them that seeke him, of them that seeke thy face, this is Iaakob. Selah. 
\v 7 Lift vp your heads ye gates, and be ye lift vp ye euerlasting doores, and the King of glory shall come in. 
\v 8 Who is this King of glorie? the Lord, strong and mightie, euen the Lord mightie in battell. 
\v 9 Lift vp your heads, ye gates, and lift vp your selues, ye euerlasting doores, and the King of glorie shall come in. 
\v 10 Who is this King of glory? the Lord of hostes, he is the King of glorie. Selah.

\v 1 A Psalme of David. Unto thee, O Lord, lift I vp my soule. 
\v 2 My God, I trust in thee: let me not be confounded: let not mine enemies reioyce ouer mee. 
\v 3 So all that hope in thee, shall not be ashamed: but let them be confounded, that transgresse without cause. 
\v 4 Shew me thy waies, O Lord, and teache me thy paths. 
\v 5 Leade me foorth in thy trueth, and teache me: for thou art the God of my saluation: in thee doe I trust all the day. 
\v 6 Remember, O Lord, thy tender mercies, and thy louing kindnesse: for they haue beene for euer. 
\v 7 Remember not the sinnes of my youth, nor my rebellions, but according to thy kindenesse remember thou me, euen for thy goodnesse sake, O Lord. 
\v 8 Gracious and righteous is the Lord: therefore will he teache sinners in the way. 
\v 9 Them that be meeke, will hee guide in iudgement, and teach the humble his way. 
\v 10 All the pathes of the Lord are mercie and trueth vnto such as keepe his couenant and his testimonies. 
\v 11 For thy Names sake, O Lord, be merciful vnto mine iniquitie, for it is great. 
\v 12 What man is he that feareth the Lord? him wil he teache the way that hee shall chuse. 
\v 13 His soule shall dwell at ease, and his seede shall inherite the land. 
\v 14 The secrete of the Lord is reueiled to them, that feare him: and his couenant to giue them vnderstanding. 
\v 15 Mine eyes are euer towarde the Lord: for he will bring my feete out of the net. 
\v 16 Turne thy face vnto mee, and haue mercie vpon me: for I am desolate and poore. 
\v 17 The sorowes of mine heart are enlarged: drawe me out of my troubles. 
\v 18 Looke vpon mine affliction and my trauel, and forgiue all my sinnes. 
\v 19 Beholde mine enemies, for they are manie, and they hate me with cruell hatred. 
\v 20 Keepe my soule, and deliuer me: let me not be confounded, for I trust in thee. 
\v 21 Let mine vprightnes and equitie preserue me: for mine hope is in thee. 
\v 22 Deliuer Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.

\v 1 A Psalme of David. Judge me, O Lord, for I haue walked in mine innocency: my trust hath bene also in the Lord: therefore shall I not slide. 
\v 2 Proue me, O Lord, and trie mee: examine my reines, and mine heart. 
\v 3 For thy louing kindnesse is before mine eyes: therefore haue I walked in thy trueth. 
\v 4 I haue not hanted with vaine persons, neither kept companie with the dissemblers. 
\v 5 I haue hated the assemblie of the euill, and haue not companied with the wicked. 
\v 6 I will wash mine handes in innocencie, O Lord, and compasse thine altar, 
\v 7 That I may declare with the voyce of thankesgiuing, and set foorth all thy wonderous woorkes. 
\v 8 O Lord, I haue loued the habitation of thine house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth. 
\v 9 Gather not my soule with the sinners, nor my life with the bloodie men: 
\v 10 In whose handes is wickednes, and their right hand is full of bribes. 
\v 11 But I will walke in mine innocencie: redeeme me therefore, and be mercifull vnto me. 
\v 12 My foote standeth in vprightnesse: I will praise thee, O Lord, in the Congregations.

\p
\v 1 A Psalme of David. The Lord is my light and my saluation, whom shall I feare? the Lord is the strength of my life, of whome shall I be afraide? 
\v 2 When the wicked, euen mine enemies and my foes came vpon mee to eate vp my flesh; they stumbled and fell. 
\v 3 Though an hoste pitched against me, mine heart should not be afraide: though warre be raised against me, I will trust in this. 
\v 4 One thing haue I desired of the Lord, that I will require, euen that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the dayes of my life, to beholde the beautie of the Lord, and to visite his Temple. 
\v 5 For in the time of trouble hee shall hide mee in his Tabernacle: in the secrete place of his pauillion shall he hide me, and set me vp vpon a rocke. 
\v 6 And nowe shall hee lift vp mine head aboue mine enemies rounde about mee: therefore wil I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of ioy: I wil sing and praise the Lord. 
\v 7 Hearken vnto my voyce, O Lord, when I crie: haue mercie also vpon mee and heare mee. 
\v 8 When thou saidest, Seeke ye my face, mine heart answered vnto thee, O Lord, I will seeke thy face. 
\v 9 Hide not therefore thy face from mee, nor cast thy seruat away in displeasure: thou hast bene my succour: leaue me not, neither forsake mee, O God of my saluation. 
\v 10 Though my father and my mother shoulde forsake me, yet the Lord will gather me vp. 
\v 11 Teache mee thy way, O Lord, and leade me in a right path, because of mine enemies. 
\v 12 Giue me not vnto the lust of mine aduersaries: for there are false witnesses risen vp against me, and such as speake cruelly. 
\v 13 I should haue fainted, except I had beleeued to see the goodnes of the Lord in the land of the liuing. 
\v 14 Hope in the Lord: be strong, and he shall comfort thine heart, and trust in the Lord.

\v 1 A Psalme of David. Unto thee, O Lord, doe I crie: O my strength, be not deafe toward mee, lest, if thou answere me not, I be like them that goe downe into the pit. 
\v 2 Heare the voyce of my petitions, when I crie vnto thee, when I holde vp mine handes towarde thine holy Oracle. 
\v 3 Drawe mee not away with the wicked, and with the woorkers of iniquitie: which speake friendly to their neighbours, when malice is in their hearts. 
\v 4 Reward them according to their deedes, and according to the wickednes of their inuentions: recompense them after the woorke of their handes: render them their reward. 
\v 5 For they regarde not the woorkes of the Lord, nor the operation of his handes: therefore breake them downe, and builde them not vp. 
\v 6 Praised be the Lord, for he hath heard the voyce of my petitions. 
\v 7 The Lord is my strength and my shielde: mine heart trusted in him, and I was helped: therfore mine heart shall reioyce, and with my song will I praise him. 
\v 8 The Lord is their strength, and he is the strength of the deliuerances of his anointed.

\v 1 A Psalme of David. Give vnto the Lord, ye sonnes of the mightie: giue vnto the Lord glorie and strength. 
\v 2 Giue vnto the Lord glorie due vnto his Name: worship the Lord in the glorious Sanctuarie. 
\v 3 The voyce of the Lord is vpon the waters: the God of glorie maketh it to thunder: the Lord is vpon the great waters. 
\v 4 The voyce of the Lord is mightie: the voyce of the Lord is glorious. 
\v 5 The voyce of the Lord breaketh the cedars: yea, the Lord breaketh the cedars of Lebanon. 
\v 6 He maketh them also to leape like a calfe: Lebanon also and Shirion like a yong vnicorne. 
\v 7 The voice of the Lord deuideth the flames of sire. 
\v 8 The voice of the Lord maketh the wildernes to tremble: the Lord maketh the wildernes of Kadesh to tremble. 
\v 9 The voice of the Lord maketh the hindes to calue, and discouereth the forests: therefore in his Temple doth euery man speake of his glory. 
\v 10 The Lord sitteth vpon the flood, and the Lord doeth remaine King for euer. 
\v 11 The Lord shall giue strength vnto his people: the Lord shall blesse his people with peace.

\v 1 A Psalme or song of the dedication of the house of David. I will magnifie thee, O Lord: for thou hast exalted mee, and hast not made my foe to reioyce ouer me. 
\v 2 O Lord my God, I cried vnto thee, and thou hast restored me. 
\v 3 O Lord, thou hast brought vp my soule out of the graue: thou hast reuiued me from them that goe downe into the pit. 
\v 4 Sing praises vnto the Lord, ye his Saintes, and giue thankes before the remembrance of his Holinesse. 
\v 5 For he endureth but a while in his anger: but in his fauour is life: weeping may abide at euening, but ioy commeth in the morning. 
\v 6 And in my prosperitie I sayde, I shall neuer be moued. 
\v 7 For thou Lord of thy goodnes hadest made my mountaine to stande strong: but thou didest hide thy face, and I was troubled. 
\v 8 Then cried I vnto thee, O Lord, and praied to my Lord. 
\v 9 What profite is there in my blood, when I go downe to the pit? shall the dust giue thankes vnto thee? or shall it declare thy trueth? 
\v 10 Heare, O Lord, and haue mercy vpon me: Lord, be thou mine helper. 
\v 11 Thou hast turned my mourning into ioy: thou hast loosed my sacke and girded mee with gladnesse. 
\v 12 Therefore shall my tongue praise thee and not cease: O Lord my God, I will giue thankes vnto thee for euer. 
\c 31

\v 1 To him that excelleth. A Psalme of David. In thee, O Lord, haue I put my trust: let mee neuer be confounded: deliuer me in thy righteousnesse. 
\v 2 Bowe downe thine eare to me: make haste to deliuer mee: be vnto me a stronge rocke, and an house of defence to saue me. 
\v 3 For thou art my rocke and my fortresse: therefore for thy Names sake direct mee and guide me. 
\v 4 Drawe mee out of the nette, that they haue layde priuilie for mee: for thou art my strength. 
\v 5 Into thine hand I commend my spirit: for thou hast redeemed me, O Lord God of trueth. 
\v 6 I haue hated them that giue them selues to deceitfull vanities: for I trust in the Lord. 
\v 7 I wil be glad and reioyce in thy mercie: for thou hast seene my trouble: thou hast knowen my soule in aduersities, 
\v 8 And thou hast not shut me vp in the hand of the enemie, but hast set my feete at large. 
\v 9 Haue mercie vpon mee, O Lord: for I am in trouble: mine eye, my soule and my bellie are consumed with griefe. 
\v 10 For my life is wasted with heauinesse, and my yeeres with mourning: my strength faileth for my paine, and my bones are consumed. 
\v 11 I was a reproch among all mine enemies, but specially among my neighbours: and a feare to mine acquaintance, who seeing me in the streete, fled from me. 
\v 12 I am forgotten, as a dead man out of minde: I am like a broken vessell. 
\v 13 For I haue heard the rayling of great men: feare was on euery side, while they conspired together against mee, and consulted to take my life. 
\v 14 But I trusted in thee, O Lord: I said, Thou art my God. 
\v 15 My times are in thine hande: deliuer mee from the hande of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me. 
\v 16 Make thy face to shine vpon thy seruant, and saue me through thy mercie. 
\v 17 Let me not be confounded, O Lord: for I haue called vpon thee: let the wicked bee put to confusion, and to silence in the graue. 
\v 18 Let the lying lips be made dumme, which cruelly, proudly and spitefully speake against the righteous. 
\v 19 Howe great is thy goodnesse, which thou hast layde vp for them, that feare thee! and done to them, that trust in thee, euen before the sonnes of men! 
\v 20 Thou doest hide them priuily in thy presence from the pride of men: thou keepest them secretly in thy Tabernacle from the strife of tongues. 
\v 21 Blessed be the Lord: for hee hath shewed his marueilous kindenesse toward me in a strong citie. 
\v 22 Though I said in mine haste, I am cast out of thy sight, yet thou heardest the voyce of my prayer, when I cryed vnto thee. 
\v 23 Loue ye the Lord all his Saintes: for the Lord preserueth the faithfull, and rewardeth abundantly the proud doer. 
\v 24 All ye that trust in the Lord, be strong, and he shall establish your heart. 
\c 32  
\p
\v 1 A Psalme of David to give instruction. Blessed is he whose wickednes is forgiuen, and whose sinne is couered. 
\v 2 Blessed is the man, vnto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquitie, and in whose spirite there is no guile. 
\v 3 When I helde my tongue, my bones consumed, or when I roared all the day, 
\v 4 (For thine hand is heauie vpon me, day and night: and my moysture is turned into ye drought of summer. Selah) 
\v 5 Then I acknowledged my sinne vnto thee, neither hid I mine iniquitie: for I thought, I will confesse against my selfe my wickednesse vnto the Lord, and thou forgauest the punishment of my sinne. Selah. 
\v 6 Therefore shall euery one, that is godly, make his prayer vnto thee in a time, when thou mayest be founde: surely in the flood of great waters they shall not come neere him. 
\v 7 Thou art my secret place: thou preseruest me from trouble: thou compassest me about with ioyfull deliuerance. Selah. 
\v 8 I will instruct thee, and teache thee in the way that thou shalt goe, and I will guide thee with mine eye. 
\v 9 Be ye not like an horse, or like a mule, which vnderstand not: whose mouthes thou doest binde with bit and bridle, least they come neere thee. 
\v 10 Many sorowes shall come to the wicked: but he, that trusteth in the Lord, mercie shall compasse him. 
\v 11 Be glad ye righteous, and reioyce in the Lord, and be ioyfull all ye, that are vpright in heart. 
\c 33  
\p
\v 1 Rejoice in the Lord, O ye righteous: for it becommeth vpright men to be thankefull. 
\v 2 Prayse the Lord with harpe: sing vnto him with viole and instrument of ten strings. 
\v 3 Sing vnto him a newe song: sing cheerefully with a loude voyce. 
\v 4 For the word of the Lord is righteous, and all his workes are faithfull. 
\v 5 He loueth righteousnesse and iudgement: the earth is full of the goodnesse of the Lord. 
\v 6 By the worde of the Lord were the heauens made, and all the hoste of them by the breath of his mouth. 
\v 7 He gathereth the waters of the sea together as vpon an heape, and layeth vp the depths in his treasures. 
\v 8 Let all the earth feare the Lord: let al them that dwell in the world, feare him. 
\v 9 For he spake, and it was done: he commanded, and it stood. 
\v 10 The Lord breaketh the counsell of the heathen, and bringeth to nought the deuices of the people. 
\v 11 The counsell of the Lord shall stand for euer, and the thoughts of his heart throughout all ages. 
\v 12 Blessed is that nation, whose God is the Lord: euen the people that he hath chosen for his inheritance. 
\v 13 The Lord looketh downe from heauen, and beholdeth all the children of men. 
\v 14 From the habitation of his dwelling he beholdeth all them that dwell in the earth. 
\v 15 He facioneth their hearts euery one, and vnderstandeth all their workes. 
\v 16 The King is not saued by the multitude of an hoste, neither is the mightie man deliuered by great strength. 
\v 17 A horse is a vaine helpe, and shall not deliuer any by his great strength. 
\v 18 Beholde, the eye of the Lord is vpon them that feare him, and vpon them, that trust in his mercie, 
\v 19 To deliuer their soules from death, and to preserue them in famine. 
\v 20 Our soule waiteth for the Lord: for he is our helpe and our shielde. 
\v 21 Surely our heart shall reioyce in him, because we trusted in his holy Name. 
\v 22 Let thy mercie, O Lord, be vpon vs, as we trust in thee. 
\c 34  
\p
\v 1 A Psalme of Dauid, when he changed his behauiour before Abimelech, who droue him away, and he departed. I will alway giue thankes vnto the Lord: his praise shalbe in my mouth continually. 
\v 2 My soule shall glory in the Lord: the humble shall heare it, and be glad. 
\v 3 Praise ye the Lord with me, and let vs magnifie his Name together. 
\v 4 I sought the Lord, and he heard me: yea, he deliuered me out of all my feare. 
\v 5 They shall looke vnto him, and runne to him: and their faces shall not be ashamed, saying, 
\v 6 This poore man cryed, and the Lord heard him, and saued him out of all his troubles. 
\v 7 The Angel of the Lord pitcheth round about them, that feare him, and deliuereth them. 
\v 8 Taste ye and see, howe gratious the Lord is: blessed is the man that trusteth in him. 
\v 9 Feare the Lord, ye his Saintes: for nothing wanteth to them that feare him. 
\v 10 The lyons doe lacke and suffer hunger, but they, which seeke the Lord, shall want nothing that is good. 
\v 11 Come children, hearken vnto me: I will teache you the feare of the Lord. 
\v 12 What man is he, that desireth life, and loueth long dayes for to see good? 
\v 13 Keepe thy tongue from euill, and thy lips, that they speake no guile. 
\v 14 Eschewe euill and doe good: seeke peace and follow after it. 
\v 15 The eyes of the Lord are vpon the righteous, and his eares are open vnto their crie. 
\v 16 But the face of the Lord is against them that doe euill, to cut off their remembrance from the earth. 
\v 17 The righteous crie, and the Lord heareth them, and deliuereth them out of all their troubles. 
\v 18 The Lord is neere vnto them that are of a contrite heart, and will saue such as be afflicted in Spirite. 
\v 19 Great are the troubles of the righteous: but the Lord deliuereth him out of them all. 
\v 20 He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken. 
\v 21 But malice shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous, shall perish. 
\v 22 The Lord redeemeth the soules of his seruants: and none, that trust in him, shall perish. 
\c 35

\v 1 A Psalme of Dauid. Pleade thou my cause, O Lord, with them that striue with me: fight thou against them, that fight against me. 
\v 2 Lay hand vpon the shielde and buckler, and stand vp for mine helpe. 
\v 3 Bring out also the speare and stop the way against them, that persecute me: say vnto my soule, I am thy saluation. 
\v 4 Let them be confounded and put to shame, that seeke after my soule: let them be turned backe, and brought to confusion, that imagine mine hurt. 
\v 5 Let them be as chaffe before the winde, and let the Angel of the Lord scatter them. 
\v 6 Let their way be darke and slipperie: and let the Angel of the Lord persecute them. 
\v 7 For without cause they haue hid the pit and their net for me: without cause haue they digged a pit for my soule. 
\v 8 Let destruction come vpon him at vnwares, and let his net, that he hath laid priuilie, take him: let him fall into the same destruction. 
\v 9 Then my soule shalbe ioyfull in the Lord: it shall reioyce in his saluation. 
\v 10 All my bones shall say, Lord, who is like vnto thee, which deliuerest the poore from him, that is too strong for him! yea, the poore and him that is in miserie, from him that spoyleth him! 
\v 11 Cruell witnesses did rise vp: they asked of me things that I knewe not. 
\v 12 They rewarded me euill for good, to haue spoyled my soule. 
\v 13 Yet I, when they were sicke, I was clothed with a sacke: I humbled my soule with fasting: and my praier was turned vpon my bosome. 
\v 14 I behaued my selfe as to my friend, or as to my brother: I humbled my selfe, mourning as one that bewaileth his mother. 
\v 15 But in mine aduersitie they reioyced, and gathered them selues together: the abiects assembled themselues against me, and knewe not: they tare me and ceased not, 
\v 16 With the false skoffers at bankets, gnashing their teeth against me. 
\v 17 Lord, how long wilt thou beholde this? deliuer my soule from their tumult, euen my desolate soule from the lions. 
\v 18 So will I giue thee thankes in a great Congregation: I will praise thee among much people. 
\v 19 Let not them that are mine enemies, vniustly reioyce ouer mee, neyther let them winke with the eye, that hate mee without a cause. 
\v 20 For they speake not as friendes: but they imagine deceitfull woordes against the quiet of the lande. 
\v 21 And they gaped on mee with their mouthes, saying, Aha, aha, our eye hath seene. 
\v 22 Thou hast seene it, O Lord: keepe not silence: be not farre from me, O Lord. 
\v 23 Arise and wake to my iudgement, euen to my cause, my God, and my Lord. 
\v 24 Iudge me, O Lord my God, according to thy righteousnesse, and let them not reioyce ouer mee. 
\v 25 Let them not say in their hearts, O our soule reioyce: neither let them say, We haue deuoured him. 
\v 26 Let them bee confounded, and put to shame together, that reioyce at mine hurt: let them bee clothed with confusion and shame, that lift vp themselues against me. 
\v 27 But let them be ioyful and glad, that loue my righteousnesse: yea, let them say alway, Let the Lord be magnified, which loueth the prosperitie of his seruant. 
\v 28 And my tongue shall vtter thy righteousnesse, and thy praise euery day.

\v 1 To him that excelleth. A Psalme of Dauid, the servant of the Lord. Wickedness sayeth to the wicked man, euen in mine heart, that there is no feare of God before his eyes. 
\v 2 For hee flattereth himselfe in his owne eyes, while his iniquitie is foud worthy to be hated. 
\v 3 The wordes of his mouth are iniquitie and deceit: hee hath left off to vnderstand and to doe good. 
\v 4 Hee imagineth mischiefe vpon his bed: he setteth himselfe vpon a way, that is not good, and doeth not abhorre euill. 
\v 5 Thy mercy, O Lord, reacheth vnto the heauens, and thy faithfulnesse vnto the cloudes. 
\v 6 Thy righteousnesse is like the mightie moutaines: thy iudgements are like a great deepe: thou, Lord, doest saue man and beast. 
\v 7 How excellent is thy mercy, O God! therefore the children of men trust vnder the shadowe of thy wings. 
\v 8 They shall be satisfied with the fatnesse of thine house, and thou shalt giue them drinke out of the riuer of thy pleasures. 
\v 9 For with thee is the well of life, and in thy light shall we see light. 
\v 10 Extend thy louing kindnes vnto them that knowe thee, and thy righteousnesse vnto them that are vpright in heart. 
\v 11 Let not ye foote of pride come against me, and let not the hand of ye wicked men moue me. 
\v 12 There they are fallen that worke iniquity: they are cast downe, and shall not be able to rise. 
\c 37  
\p
\v 1 A Psalme of David. Fret not thy selfe because of the wicked men, neither be enuious for the euill doers. 
\v 2 For they shall soone bee cut downe like grasse, and shall wither as the greene herbe. 
\v 3 Trust thou in the Lord and do good: dwell in the land, and thou shalt be fed assuredly. 
\v 4 And delite thy selfe in the Lord, and hee shall giue thee thine hearts desire. 
\v 5 Commit thy way vnto the Lord, and trust in him, and he shall bring it to passe. 
\v 6 And he shall bring foorth thy righteousnes as the light, and thy iudgement as the noone day. 
\v 7 Waite patiently vpon the Lord and hope in him: fret not thy selfe for him which prospereth in his way: nor for the man that bringeth his enterprises to passe. 
\v 8 Cease from anger, and leaue off wrath: fret not thy selfe also to doe euill. 
\v 9 For euill doers shalbe cut off, and they that wait vpon the Lord, they shall inherite the land. 
\v 10 Therefore yet a litle while, and the wicked shall not appeare, and thou shalt looke after his place, and he shall not be found. 
\v 11 But meeke men shall possesse the earth, and shall haue their delite in the multitude of peace. 
\v 12 The wicked practiseth against the iust, and gnasheth his teeth against him. 
\v 13 But the Lord shall laugh him to scorne: for he seeth, that his day is comming. 
\v 14 The wicked haue drawen their sworde, and haue bent their bowe, to cast downe the poore and needie, and to slay such as be of vpright conuersation. 
\v 15 But their sword shall enter into their owne heart, and their bowes shalbe broken. 
\v 16 A small thing vnto the iust man is better, then great riches to the wicked and mightie. 
\v 17 For the armes of the wicked shall be broken: but the Lord vpholdeth the iust men. 
\v 18 The Lord knoweth the dayes of vpright men, and their inheritance shall bee perpetuall. 
\v 19 They shall not be confounded in the perilous time, and in the daies of famine they shall haue ynough. 
\v 20 But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the Lord shall be consumed as the fatte of lambes: euen with the smoke shall they consume away. 
\v 21 The wicked boroweth and payeth not againe. but the righteous is mercifull, and giueth. 
\v 22 For such as be blessed of God, shall inherite the lande, and they that be cursed of him, shalbe cut off. 
\v 23 The pathes of man are directed by the Lord: for he loueth his way. 
\v 24 Though he fall, hee shall not be cast off: for the Lord putteth vnder his hand. 
\v 25 I haue beene yong, and am olde: yet I sawe neuer the righteous forsaken, nor his seede begging bread. 
\v 26 But hee is euer mercifull and lendeth, and his seede enioyeth the blessing. 
\v 27 Flee from euill and doe good, and dwell for euer. 
\v 28 For the Lord loueth iudgement, and forsaketh not his Saintes: they shall be preserued for euermore: but the seede of the wicked shall be cut off. 
\v 29 The righteous men shall inherit the lande, and dwell therein for euer. 
\v 30 The mouth of the righteous will speake of wisedome, and his tongue will talke of iudgement. 
\v 31 For the Lawe of his God is in his heart, and his steppes shall not slide. 
\v 32 The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him. 
\v 33 But the Lord wil not leaue him in his hand, nor condemne him, when he is iudged. 
\v 34 Waite thou on the Lord, and keepe his way, and he shall exalt thee, that thou shalt inherite the lande: when the wicked men shall perish, thou shalt see. 
\v 35 I haue seene the wicked strong, and spreading himselfe like a greene bay tree. 
\v 36 Yet he passed away, and loe, he was gone, and I sought him, but he could not be founde. 
\v 37 Marke the vpright man, and beholde the iust: for the end of that man is peace. 
\v 38 But the transgressours shall be destroyed together, and the ende of the wicked shall bee cut off. 
\v 39 But the saluation of the righteous men shalbe of the Lord: he shalbe their strength in the time of trouble. 
\v 40 For the Lord shall helpe them, and deliuer them: he shall deliuer them from the wicked, and shall saue them, because they trust in him.

\v 1 A Psalme of Dauid for remembrance. O Lord, rebuke mee not in thine anger, neither chastise me in thy wrath. 
\v 2 For thine arrowes haue light vpon me, and thine hand lyeth vpon me. 
\v 3 There is nothing sound in my flesh, because of thine anger: neither is there rest in my bones because of my sinne. 
\v 4 For mine iniquities are gone ouer mine head, and as a weightie burden they are too heauie for me. 
\v 5 My woundes are putrified, and corrupt because of my foolishnes. 
\v 6 I am bowed, and crooked very sore: I goe mourning all the day. 
\v 7 For my reines are full of burning, and there is nothing sound in my flesh. 
\v 8 I am weakened and sore broken: I roare for the very griefe of mine heart. 
\v 9 Lord, I powre my whole desire before thee, and my sighing is not hid from thee. 
\v 10 Mine heart panteth: my strength faileth me, and the light of mine eyes, euen they are not mine owne. 
\v 11 My louers and my friends stand aside from my plague, and my kinsmen stand a farre off. 
\v 12 They also, that seeke after my life, laye snares, and they that go about to do me euil, talke wicked things and imagine deceite continually. 
\v 13 But I as a deafe man heard not, and am as a dumme man, which openeth not his mouth. 
\v 14 Thus am I as a man, that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofes. 
\v 15 For on thee, O Lord, do I waite: thou wilt heare me, my Lord, my God. 
\v 16 For I said, Heare me, least they reioyce ouer me: for when my foote slippeth, they extol themselues against me. 
\v 17 Surely I am ready to halte, and my sorow is euer before me. 
\v 18 When I declare my paine, and am sory for my sinne, 
\v 19 Then mine enemies are aliue and are mightie, and they that hate me wrongfully are many. 
\v 20 They also, that rewarde euill for good, are mine aduersaries, because I follow goodnesse. 
\v 21 Forsake me not, O Lord: be not thou farre from me, my God. 
\v 22 Haste thee to helpe mee, O my Lord, my saluation.

\v 1 To the excellent musician Ieduthun. I thought, I will take heede to my wayes, that I sinne not with my tongue: I will keepe my mouth brideled, while the wicked is in my sight. 
\v 2 I was dumme and spake nothing: I kept silece euen from good, and my sorow was more stirred. 
\v 3 Mine heart was hote within me, and while I was musing, the fire kindeled, and I spake with my tongue, saying, 
\v 4 Lord, let me know mine ende, and the measure of my dayes, what it is: let mee knowe howe long I haue to liue. 
\v 5 Beholde, thou hast made my dayes as an hand breadth, and mine age as nothing in respect of thee: surely euery man in his best state is altogether vanitie. Selah. 
\v 6 Doubtlesse man walketh in a shadowe, and disquieteth himselfe in vaine: he heapeth vp riches, and cannot tell who shall gather them. 
\v 7 And now Lord, what wait I for? mine hope is euen in thee. 
\v 8 Deliuer me from all my transgressions, and make me not a rebuke vnto the foolish. 
\v 9 I should haue bene dumme, and not haue opened my mouth, because thou didest it. 
\v 10 Take thy plague away from mee: for I am consumed by the stroke of thine hand. 
\v 11 When thou with rebukes doest chastise man for iniquitie, thou as a mothe makest his beautie to consume: surely euery man is vanitie. Selah. 
\v 12 Heare my prayer, O Lord, and hearken vnto my cry: keepe not silence at my teares, for I am a strager with thee, and a soiourner as all my fathers. 
\v 13 Stay thine anger from me, that I may recouer my strength, before I go hence and be not. 
\c 40  
\p
\v 1 To him that excelleth. A Psalme of David. I Waited paciently for the Lord, and he inclined vnto me, and heard my cry. 
\v 2 Hee brought mee also out of the horrible pit, out of the myrie clay, and set my feete vpon the rocke, and ordered my goings. 
\v 3 And he hath put in my mouth a new song of praise vnto our God: many shall see it and feare, and shall trust in the Lord. 
\v 4 Blessed is the man that maketh the Lord his trust, and regardeth not the proude, nor such as turne aside to lyes. 
\v 5 O Lord my God, thou hast made thy wonderfull workes so many, that none can count in order to thee thy thoughts toward vs: I would declare, and speake of them, but they are moe then I am able to expresse. 
\v 6 Sacrifice and offering thou didest not desire: (for mine eares hast thou prepared) burnt offring and sinne offering hast thou not required. 
\v 7 Then said I, Lo, I come: for in the rolle of the booke it is written of me, 
\v 8 I desired to doe thy good will, O my God: yea, thy Lawe is within mine heart. 
\v 9 I haue declared thy righteousnesse in the great Congregation: loe, I will not refraine my lippes: O Lord, thou knowest. 
\v 10 I haue not hidde thy righteousnesse within mine heart, but I haue declared thy trueth and thy saluation: I haue not conceiled thy mercy and thy trueth from the great Congregation. 
\v 11 Withdrawe not thou thy tender mercie from mee, O Lord: let thy mercie and thy trueth alway preserue me. 
\v 12 For innumerable troubles haue compassed mee: my sinnes haue taken such holde vpon me, that I am not able to looke vp: yea, they are moe in nomber then the heares of mine head: therefore mine heart hath failed me. 
\v 13 Let it please thee, O Lord, to deliuer mee: make haste, O Lord, to helpe me. 
\v 14 Let them be confounded and put to shame together, that seeke my soule to destroye it: let them be driuen backward and put to rebuke, that desire mine hurt. 
\v 15 Let them be destroyed for a rewarde of their shame, which say vnto me, Aha, aha. 
\v 16 Let all them, that seeke thee, reioyce and be glad in thee: and let them, that loue thy saluation, say alway, The Lord be praysed. 
\v 17 Though I be poore and needie, the Lord thinketh on mee: thou art mine helper and my deliuerer: my God, make no tarying.

\v 1 To him that excelleth. A Psalme of Dauid. Blessed is he that iudgeth wisely of the poore: the Lord shall deliuer him in ye time of trouble. 
\v 2 The Lord will keepe him, and preserue him aliue: he shalbe blessed vpon the earth, and thou wilt not deliuer him vnto the will of his enemies. 
\v 3 The Lord wil strengthen him vpon ye bed of sorow: thou hast turned al his bed in his sicknes. 
\v 4 Therefore I saide, Lord haue mercie vpon me: heale my soule, for I haue sinned against thee. 
\v 5 Mine enemies speake euill of me, saying, When shall he die, and his name perish? 
\v 6 And if hee come to see mee, hee speaketh lies, but his heart heapeth iniquitie within him, and when he commeth foorth, he telleth it. 
\v 7 All they that hate me, whisper together against me: euen against me do they imagine mine hurt. 
\v 8 A mischiefe is light vpon him, and he that lyeth, shall no more rise. 
\v 9 Yea, my familiar friend, whom I trusted, which did eate of my bread, hath lifted vp the heele against me. 
\v 10 Therefore, O Lord, haue mercy vpon mee, and raise me vp: so I shall reward them. 
\v 11 By this I know that thou fauourest me, because mine enemie doth not triumph against me. 
\v 12 And as for me, thou vpholdest me in mine integritie, and doest set me before thy face for euer. 
\v 13 Blessed be the Lord God of Israel worlde without ende. So be it, euen so be it.

\v 1 To him that excelleth. A Psalme to give instruction, committed to the sonnes of Korah. As the harte brayeth for the riuers of water, so panteth my soule after thee, O God. 
\v 2 My soule thirsteth for God, euen for the liuing God: when shall I come and appeare before the presence of God? 
\v 3 My teares haue bin my meate day and night, while they dayly say vnto me, Where is thy God? 
\v 4 When I remembred these things, I powred out my very heart, because I had gone with the multitude, and ledde them into the House of God with the voyce of singing, and prayse, as a multitude that keepeth a feast. 
\v 5 Why art thou cast downe, my soule, and vnquiet within me? waite on God: for I will yet giue him thankes for the helpe of his presence. 
\v 6 My God, my soule is cast downe within me, because I remember thee, from the land of Iorden, and Hermonim, and from the mount Mizar. 
\v 7 One deepe calleth another deepe by the noyse of thy water spoutes: all thy waues and thy floods are gone ouer me. 
\v 8 The Lord will graunt his louing kindenesse in the day, and in the night shall I sing of him, euen a prayer vnto the God of my life. 
\v 9 I wil say vnto God, which is my rocke, Why hast thou forgotten mee? why goe I mourning, when the enemie oppresseth me? 
\v 10 My bones are cut asunder, while mine enemies reproch me, saying dayly vnto me, Where is thy God? 
\v 11 Why art thou cast downe, my soule? and why art thou disquieted within mee? waite on God: for I wil yet giue him thankes: he is my present helpe, and my God. 
\c 43

\v 1 Judge me, O God, and defend my cause against the vnmercifull people: deliuer mee from the deceitfull and wicked man. 
\v 2 For thou art the God of my strength: why hast thou put me away? why goe I so mourning, when the enemie oppresseth me? 
\v 3 Sende thy light and thy trueth: let them leade mee: let them bring mee vnto thine holy Mountaine and to thy Tabernacles. 
\v 4 Then wil I go vnto the altar of God, euen vnto the God of my ioy and gladnes: and vpon the harpe wil I giue thanks vnto thee, O God, my God. 
\v 5 Why art thou cast downe, my soule? and why art thou disquieted within mee? waite on God: for I will yet giue him thankes, he is my present helpe, and my God.

\v 1 To him that excelleth. A Psalme to give instruction, committed to the sonnes of Korah. We haue heard with our eares, O God: our fathers haue tolde vs the workes, that thou hast done in their dayes, in the olde time: 
\v 2 Howe thou hast driuen out the heathen with thine hand, and planted them: how thou hast destroyed the people, and caused them to grow. 
\v 3 For they inherited not the lande by their owne sworde, neither did their owne arme saue them: but thy right hand, and thine arme and the light of thy countenance, because thou didest fauour them. 
\v 4 Thou art my King, O God: send helpe vnto Iaakob. 
\v 5 Through thee haue we thrust backe our aduersaries: by thy Name haue we troden downe them that rose vp against vs. 
\v 6 For I do not trust in my bowe, neither can my sworde saue me. 
\v 7 But thou hast saued vs from our aduersaries, and hast put them to confusion that hate vs. 
\v 8 Therefore will wee praise God continually, and will confesse thy Name for euer. Selah. 
\v 9 But now thou art farre off, and puttest vs to confusion, and goest not forth with our armies. 
\v 10 Thou makest vs to turne backe from the aduersary, and they, which hate vs, spoile for theselues. 
\v 11 Thou giuest vs as sheepe to bee eaten, and doest scatter vs among the nations. 
\v 12 Thou sellest thy people without gaine, and doest not increase their price. 
\v 13 Thou makest vs a reproche to our neighbours, a iest and a laughing stocke to them that are round about vs. 
\v 14 Thou makest vs a prouerbe among the nations, and a nodding of the head among the people. 
\v 15 My confusion is dayly before me, and the shame of my face hath couered me, 
\v 16 For the voyce of the slaunderer and rebuker, for the enemie and auenger. 
\v 17 All this is come vpon vs, yet doe wee not forget thee, neither deale wee falsly concerning thy couenant. 
\v 18 Our heart is not turned backe: neither our steps gone out of thy paths, 
\v 19 Albeit thou hast smitten vs downe into the place of dragons, and couered vs with the shadow of death. 
\v 20 If wee haue forgotten the Name of our God, and holden vp our hands to a strange god, 
\v 21 Shall not God searche this out? for hee knoweth the secrets of the heart. 
\v 22 Surely for thy sake are we slaine continually, and are counted as sheepe for the slaughter. 
\v 23 Vp, why sleepest thou, O Lord? awake, be not farre off for euer. 
\v 24 Wherefore hidest thou thy face? and forgettest our miserie and our affliction? 
\v 25 For our soule is beaten downe vnto the dust: our belly cleaueth vnto the ground. 
\v 26 Rise vp for our succour, and redeeme vs for thy mercies sake.

\v 2 Thou art fayrer then the children of men: grace is powred in thy lips, because God hath blessed thee for euer. 
\v 3 Gird thy sword vpon thy thigh, O most mightie, to wit, thy worship and thy glory, 
\v 4 And prosper with thy glory: ride vpon the worde of trueth and of meekenes and of righteousnes: so thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things. 
\v 5 Thine arrowes are sharpe to pearce the heart of the Kings enemies: therefore the people shall fall vnder thee. 
\v 6 Thy throne, O God, is for euer and euer: the scepter of thy kingdome is a scepter of righteousnesse. 
\v 7 Thou louest righteousnes, and hatest wickednesse, because God, euen thy God hath anoynted thee with the oyle of gladnes aboue thy fellowes. 
\v 8 All thy garments smelll of myrrhe and aloes, and cassia, when thou commest out of the yuorie palaces, where they haue made thee glad. 
\v 9 Kings daugthers were among thine honorable wiues: vpon thy right hand did stand the Queene in a vesture of golde of Ophir. 
\v 10 Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine eare: forget also thine owne people and thy fathers house. 
\v 11 So shall the King haue pleasure in thy beautie: for he is thy Lord, and reuerence thou him. 
\v 12 And the daughter of Tyrus with the rich of the people shall doe homage before thy face with presents. 
\v 13 The Kings daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of broydred golde. 
\v 14 She shalbe brought vnto the King in raiment of needle worke: the virgins that follow after her, and her companions shall be brought vnto thee. 
\v 15 With ioy and gladnes shall they be brought, and shall enter into the Kings palace.

\v 3 Though the waters thereof rage and be troubled, and the mountaines shake at the surges of the same. Selah,

\v 5 God is in the middes of it: therefore shall it not be moued: God shall helpe it very earely. 
\v 6 When the nations raged, and the kingdomes were moued, God thundred, and the earth melted.

\v 8 Come, and behold the workes of the Lord, what desolations he hath made in the earth.

\v 10 O God, according vnto thy Name, so is thy prayse vnto the worlds end: thy right hand is full of righteousnes. 
\v 11 Let mount Zion reioyce, and the daughters of Iudah be glad, because of thy iudgements. 
\v 12 Compasse about Zion, and goe round about it, and tell the towres thereof. 
\v 13 Marke well the wall thereof: beholde her towres, that ye may tell your posteritie. 
\v 14 For this God is our God for euer and euer: he shall be our guide vnto the death.

\v 1 To him that excelleth. A Psalme committed to the sonnes of Korah. Heare this, all ye people: giue eare, all ye that dwell in the world, 
\v 2 As well lowe as hie, both rich and poore. 
\v 3 My mouth shall speake of wisdome, and the meditation of mine heart is of knowledge. 
\v 4 I will incline mine eare to a parable, and vtter my graue matter vpon the harpe. 
\v 5 Wherefore should I feare in the euil dayes, when iniquitie shall compasse me about, as at mine heeles? 
\v 6 They trust in their goods, and boast them selues in the multitude of their riches. 
\v 7 Yet a man can by no meanes redeeme his brother: he can not giue his raunsome to God, 
\v 8 (So precious is the redemption of their soules, and the continuance for euer) 
\v 9 That he may liue still for euer, and not see the graue. 
\v 10 For he seeth that wise men die, and also that the ignorant and foolish perish, and leaue their riches for others. 
\v 11 Yet they thinke, their houses, and their habitations shall continue for euer, euen from generation to generation, and call their lands by their names. 
\v 12 But man shall not continue in honour: he is like the beastes that die. 
\v 13 This their way vttereth their foolishnes: yet their posteritie delite in their talke. Selah. 
\v 14 Like sheepe they lie in graue: death deuoureth them, and the righteous shall haue domination ouer them in the morning: for their beautie shall consume, when they shall goe from their house to graue. 
\v 15 But God shall deliuer my soule from the power of the graue: for he will receiue me. Selah. 
\v 16 Be not thou afrayd when one is made rich, and when the glory of his house is increased. 
\v 17 For he shall take nothing away when he dieth, neither shall his pompe descende after him. 
\v 18 For while he liued, he reioyced himselfe: and men will prayse thee, when thou makest much of thy selfe. 
\v 19 He shall enter into the generation of his fathers, and they shall not liue for euer. 
\v 20 Man is in honour, and vnderstandeth not: he is like to beasts that perish. 
\c 50

\v 1 A Psalme of Asaph. The God of Gods, euen the Lord hath spoken and called the earth from the rising vp of the sunne vnto the going downe thereof. 
\v 2 Out of Zion, which is the perfection of beautie, hath God shined. 
\v 3 Our God shall come and shall not keepe silence: a fire shall deuoure before him, and a mightie tempest shall be mooued round about him. 
\v 4 Hee shall call the heauen aboue, and the earth to iudge his people. 
\v 5 Gather my Saints together vnto me, those that make a couenant with me with sacrifice. 
\v 6 And the heauens shall declare his righteousnes: for God is iudge himselfe. Selah. 
\v 7 Heare, O my people, and I wil speake: heare, O Israel, and I wil testifie vnto thee: for I am God, euen thy God. 
\v 8 I wil not reproue thee for thy sacrifices, or thy burnt offerings, that haue not bene continually before me. 
\v 9 I will take no bullocke out of thine house, nor goates out of thy foldes. 
\v 10 For all the beastes of the forest are mine, and the beastes on a thousand mountaines. 
\v 11 I knowe all the foules on the mountaines: and the wilde beastes of the fielde are mine. 
\v 12 If I bee hungry, I will not tell thee: for the world is mine, and all that therein is. 
\v 13 Will I eate the flesh of bulles? or drinke the blood of goates? 
\v 14 Offer vnto God praise, and pay thy vowes vnto the most High, 
\v 15 And call vpon me in the day of trouble: so will I deliuer thee, and thou shalt glorifie me. 
\v 16 But vnto the wicked said God, What hast thou to doe to declare mine ordinances, that thou shouldest take my couenant in thy mouth, 
\v 17 Seeing thou hatest to bee reformed, and hast cast my wordes behinde thee? 
\v 18 For when thou seest a thiefe, thou runnest with him, and thou art partaker with the adulterers. 
\v 19 Thou giuest thy mouth to euill, and with thy tongue thou forgest deceit. 
\v 20 Thou sittest, and speakest against thy brother, and slanderest thy mothers sonne. 
\v 21 These things hast thou done, and I held my tongue: therefore thou thoughtest that I was like thee: but I will reproue thee, and set them in order before thee. 
\v 22 Oh cosider this, ye that forget God, least I teare you in pieces, and there be none that can deliuer you. 
\v 23 He that offereth praise, shall glorifie mee: and to him, that disposeth his way aright, will I shew the saluation of God. 
\c 51  
\p
\v 1 To him that excelleth. A Psalme of David, when the Prophet Nathan came unto him, after he had gone in to Bath-sheba. Have mercie vpon me, O God, according to thy louing kindnes: according to the multitude of thy compassions put away mine iniquities. 
\v 2 Wash me throughly from mine iniquitie, and clense me from my sinne. 
\v 3 For I know mine iniquities, and my sinne is euer before me. 
\v 4 Against thee, against thee onely haue I sinned, and done euill in thy sight, that thou mayest be iust when thou speakest, and pure when thou iudgest. 
\v 5 Beholde, I was borne in iniquitie, and in sinne hath my mother conceiued me. 
\v 6 Beholde, thou louest trueth in the inwarde affections: therefore hast thou taught mee wisedome in the secret of mine heart. 
\v 7 Purge me with hyssope, and I shalbe cleane: wash me, and I shalbe whiter then snowe. 
\v 8 Make me to heare ioye and gladnes, that the bones, which thou hast broken, may reioyce. 
\v 9 Hide thy face from my sinnes, and put away all mine iniquities. 
\v 10 Create in mee a cleane heart, O God, and renue a right spirit within me. 
\v 11 Cast mee not away from thy presence, and take not thine holy Spirit from me. 
\v 12 Restore to me the ioy of thy saluation, and stablish me with thy free Spirit. 
\v 13 Then shall I teache thy wayes vnto the wicked, and sinners shalbe conuerted vnto thee. 
\v 14 Deliuer me from blood, O God, which art the God of my saluation, and my tongue shall sing ioyfully of thy righteousnes. 
\v 15 Open thou my lippes, O Lord, and my mouth shall shewe foorth thy praise. 
\v 16 For thou desirest no sacrifice, though I would giue it: thou delitest not in burnt offering. 
\v 17 The sacrifices of God are a contrite spirit: a contrite and a broken heart, O God, thou wilt not despise. 
\v 18 Bee fauourable vnto Zion for thy good pleasure: builde the walles of Ierusalem. 
\v 19 Then shalt thou accept ye sacrifices of righteousnes, euen the burnt offering and oblation: then shall they offer calues vpon thine altar. 
\c 52  
\p
\v 1 To him that excelleth. A Psalme of Dauid to giue instruction. When Doeg the Edomite came and shewed Saul, and saide to him, Dauid is come to the house of Abimelech. Why boastest thou thy selfe in thy wickednesse, O man of power? the louing kindenesse of God indureth dayly. 
\v 2 Thy tongue imagineth mischiefe, and is like a sharpe rasor, that cutteth deceitfully. 
\v 3 Thou doest loue euill more then good, and lies more then to speake the trueth. Selah. 
\v 4 Thou louest all wordes that may destroye, O deceitfull tongue! 
\v 5 So shall God destroy thee for euer: he shall take thee and plucke thee out of thy tabernacle, and roote thee out of ye land of the liuing. Selah. 
\v 6 The righteous also shall see it, and feare, and shall laugh at him, saying, 
\v 7 Beholde the man that tooke not God for his strength, but trusted vnto the multitude of his riches, and put his strength in his malice. 
\v 8 But I shall bee like a greene oliue tree in the house of God: for I trusted in the mercie of God for euer and euer. 
\v 9 I will alway praise thee, for that thou hast done this, and I will hope in thy Name, because it is good before thy Saints. 
\c 53  
\p
\v 1 To him that excelleth on Mahalath. A Psalme of David to give instruction. The foole hath saide in his heart, There is no God. they haue corrupted and done abominable wickednes: there is none that doeth good. 
\v 2 God looked downe from heauen vpon the children of men, to see if there were any that would vnderstand, and seeke God. 
\v 3 Euery one is gone backe: they are altogether corrupt: there is none that doth good, no not one. 
\v 4 Doe not the workers of iniquitie knowe that they eate vp my people as they eate bread? they call not vpon God. 
\v 5 There they were afraide for feare, where no feare was: for God hath scattered the bones of him that besieged thee: thou hast put them to confusion, because God hath cast them off. 
\v 6 Oh giue saluation vnto Israel out of Zion: when God turneth the captiuitie of his people, then Iaakob shall reioyce, and Israel shalbe glad. 
\c 54  
\p
\v 1 To him that excelleth on Neginoth. A Psalme of David, to give instruction. When the Ziphims came and said unto Saul, Is not David hid among us? Save mee, O God, by thy Name, and by thy power iudge me. 
\v 2 O God, heare my prayer: hearken vnto the wordes of my mouth. 
\v 3 For strangers are risen vp against me, and tyrants seeke my soule: they haue not set God before them. Selah. 
\v 4 Beholde, God is mine helper: the Lord is with them that vpholde my soule. 
\v 5 He shall rewarde euill vnto mine enemies: Oh cut them off in thy trueth! 
\v 6 Then I will sacrifice freely vnto thee: I wil praise thy Name, O Lord, because it is good. 
\v 7 For he hath deliuered me out of al trouble, and mine eye hath seene my desire vpon mine enemies. 
\c 55  
\p
\v 1 To him that excelleth on Neginoth. A Psalme of David to give instruction. Heare my prayer, O God, and hide not thy selfe from my supplication. 
\v 2 Hearken vnto me, and answere me: I mourne in my prayer, and make a noyse, 
\v 3 For the voyce of the enemie, and for the vexation of ye wicked, because they haue brought iniquitie vpon me, and furiously hate me. 
\v 4 Mine heart trembleth within mee, and the terrours of death are fallen vpon me. 
\v 5 Feare and trembling are come vpon mee, and an horrible feare hath couered me. 
\v 6 And I said, Oh that I had wings like a doue: then would I flie away and rest. 
\v 7 Beholde, I woulde take my flight farre off, and lodge in the wildernes. Selah. 
\v 8 Hee would make haste for my deliuerance from the stormie winde and tempest. 
\v 9 Destroy, O Lord, and deuide their tongues: for I haue seene crueltie and strife in the citie. 
\v 10 Day and night they goe about it vpon the walles thereof: both iniquitie and mischiefe are in the middes of it. 
\v 11 Wickednes is in the middes thereof: deceit and guile depart not from her streetes. 
\v 12 Surely mine enemie did not defame mee: for I could haue borne it: neither did mine aduersarie exalt himselfe against mee: for I would haue hid me from him. 
\v 13 But it was thou, O man, euen my companion, my guide and my familiar: 
\v 14 Which delited in consulting together, and went into the House of God as companions. 
\v 15 Let death sense vpon them: let them goe downe quicke into the graue: for wickednes is in their dwellings, euen in the middes of them. 
\v 16 But I will call vnto God, and the Lord will saue me. 
\v 17 Euening and morning, and at noone will I pray, and make a noyse, and he wil heare my voice. 
\v 18 He hath deliuered my soule in peace from the battel, that was against me: for many were with me. 
\v 19 God shall heare and afflict them, euen hee that reigneth of olde, Selah. because they haue no changes, therefore they feare not God. 
\v 20 Hee layed his hande vpon such, as be at peace with him, and he brake his couenant. 
\v 21 The wordes of his mouth were softer then butter, yet warre was in his heart: his words were more gentle then oyle, yet they were swordes. 
\v 22 Cast thy burden vpon the Lord, and hee shall nourish thee: he wil not suffer the righteous to fall for euer. 
\v 23 And thou, O God, shalt bring them downe into the pitte of corruption: the bloudie, and deceitfull men shall not liue halfe their dayes: but I will trust in thee.

\v 1 To him that excelleth. A Psalme of David on Michtam, concerning the dumme doue in a farre countrey, when the Philistims tooke him in Gath. Be mercifull vnto me, O God, for man would swallow me vp: he fighteth continually and vexeth me. 
\v 2 Mine enemies would dayly swallowe mee vp: for many fight against me, O thou most High. 
\v 3 When I was afrayd, I trusted in thee. 
\v 4 I will reioyce in God, because of his word, I trust in God, and will not feare what flesh can doe vnto me. 
\v 5 Mine owne wordes grieue me dayly: all their thoughtes are against me to doe me hurt. 
\v 6 They gather together, and keepe them selues close: they marke my steps, because they waite for my soule. 
\v 7 They thinke they shall escape by iniquitie: O God, cast these people downe in thine anger. 
\v 8 Thou hast counted my wandrings: put my teares into thy bottel: are they not in thy register? 
\v 9 When I cry, then mine enemies shall turne backe: this I know, for God is with me. 
\v 10 I will reioyce in God because of his worde: in the Lord wil I reioyce because of his worde. 
\v 11 In God doe I trust: I will not be afrayd what man can doe vnto me. 
\v 12 Thy vowes are vpon me, O God: I will render prayses vnto thee. 
\v 13 For thou hast deliuered my soule from death, and also my feete from falling, that I may walke before God in the light of the liuing. 
\c 57  
\p
\v 1 To him that excelleth. Destroy not. A Psalme of David on Michtam. When he fled from Saul in the cave. Have mercie vpon me, O God, haue mercie vpon me: for my soule trusteth in thee, and in the shadowe of thy wings wil I trust, till these afflictions ouerpasse. 
\v 2 I will call vnto the most high God, euen to the God, that performeth his promise toward me. 
\v 3 He will send from heauen, and saue me from the reproofe of him that would swallowe me. Selah. God wil send his mercy, and his trueth. 
\v 4 My soule is among lions: I lie among the children of men, that are set on fire: whose teeth are speares and arrowes, and their tongue a sharpe sworde. 
\v 5 Exalt thy selfe, O God, aboue the heauen, and let thy glory be vpon all the earth. 
\v 6 They haue layd a net for my steps: my soule is pressed downe: they haue digged a pit before me, and are fallen into the mids of it. Selah. 
\v 7 Mine heart is prepared, O God, mine heart is prepared: I will sing and giue prayse. 
\v 8 Awake my tongue, awake viole and harpe: I wil awake early. 
\v 9 I will prayse thee, O Lord, among the people, and I wil sing vnto thee among the nations. 
\v 10 For thy mercie is great vnto the heauens, and thy trueth vnto the cloudes. 
\v 11 Exalt thy selfe, O God, aboue the heauens, and let thy glory be vpon all the earth. 
\c 58  
\p
\v 1 To him that excelleth. Destroy not. A Psalme of David on Michtam. Is it true? O Congregation, speake ye iustly? O sonnes of men, iudge ye vprightly? 
\v 2 Yea, rather ye imagine mischiefe in your heart: your hands execute crueltie vpon the earth. 
\v 3 The wicked are strangers from ye wombe: euen from the belly haue they erred, and speake lyes. 
\v 4 Their poyson is euen like the poyson of a serpent: like ye deafe adder that stoppeth his eare. 
\v 5 Which heareth not the voyce of the inchanter, though he be most expert in charming. 
\v 6 Breake their teeth, O God, in their mouthes: breake the iawes of the yong lions, O Lord. 
\v 7 Let them melt like the waters, let them passe away: when hee shooteth his arrowes, let them be as broken. 
\v 8 Let them consume like a snayle that melteth, and like the vntimely fruite of a woman, that hath not seene the sunne. 
\v 9 As raw flesh before your pots feele the fire of thornes: so let him cary them away as with a whirlewinde in his wrath. 
\v 10 The righteous shall reioyce when he seeeth the vengeance: he shall wash his feete in the blood of the wicked. 
\v 11 And men shall say, Verily there is fruite for the righteous: doutlesse there is a God that iudgeth in the earth. 
\c 59  
\p
\v 1 To him that excelleth. Destroy not. A Psalme of David on Michtam. When Saul sent and they did watch the house to kill him. O my God, deliuer mee from mine enemies: defend me from them that rise vp against me. 
\v 2 Deliuer me from the wicked doers, and saue me from the bloody men. 
\v 3 For loe, they haue layd waite for my soule: the mightie men are gathered against me, not for mine offence, nor for my sinne, O Lord. 
\v 4 They runne and prepare themselues without a fault on my part: arise therefore to assist me, and beholde. 
\v 5 Euen thou, O Lord God of hostes, O God of Israel awake to visit all the heathen, and be not merciful vnto all that transgresse maliciously. Selah. 
\v 6 They goe to and from in the euening: they barke like dogs, and goe about the citie. 
\v 7 Behold, they brag in their talke, and swords are in their lips: for, Who, say they, doeth heare? 
\v 8 But thou, O Lord, shalt haue them in derision, and thou shalt laugh at all the heathen. 
\v 9 He is strong: but I will waite vpon thee: for God is my defence. 
\v 10 My mercifull God will preuent me: God wil let me see my desire vpon mine enemies. 
\v 11 Slay them not, least my people forget it: but scatter them abroad by thy power, and put them downe, O Lord our shield, 
\v 12 For the sinne of their mouth, and the words of their lips: and let them be taken in their pride, euen for their periurie and lies, that they speake. 
\v 13 Consume them in thy wrath: consume them that they be no more: and let them knowe that God ruleth in Iaakob, euen vnto the ends of the world. Selah. 
\v 14 And in the euening they shall go to and from, and barke like dogs, and go about the citie. 
\v 15 They shall runne here and there for meate: and surely they shall not be satisfied, though they tary all night. 
\v 16 But I wil sing of thy power, and will prayse thy mercy in the morning: for thou hast bene my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble. 
\v 17 Vnto thee, O my Strength, wil I sing: for God is my defence, and my mercifull God.

\v 1 To him that excelleth upon Shushan Eduth, or Michtam. A Psalme of David to teach. When he fought against Aram Naharaim, and against Aram Zobah, when Joab returned and slew twelve thousand Edomites in the salt valley. O God, thou hast cast vs out, thou hast scattered vs, thou hast bene angry, turne againe vnto vs. 
\v 2 Thou hast made the land to tremble, and hast made it to gape: heale the breaches thereof, for it is shaken. 
\v 3 Thou hast shewed thy people heauy things: thou hast made vs to drinke the wine of giddines. 
\v 4 But now thou hast giuen a banner to them that feare thee, that it may be displayed because of thy trueth. Selah. 
\v 5 That thy beloued may be deliuered, helpe with thy right hand and heare me. 
\v 6 God hath spoken in his holines: therefore I will reioyce: I shall deuide Shechem, and measure the valley of Succoth. 
\v 7 Gilead shalbe mine, and Manasseh shalbe mine: Ephraim also shalbe the strength of mine head: Iudah is my lawgiuer. 
\v 8 Moab shalbe my wash pot: ouer Edom will I cast out my shoe: Palestina shew thy selfe ioyfull for me. 
\v 9 Who will leade me into the strong citie? who will bring me vnto Edom? 
\v 10 Wilt not thou, O God, which hadest cast vs off, and didest not go forth, O God, with our armies? 
\v 11 Giue vs helpe against trouble: for vaine is the helpe of man. 
\v 12 Through God we shall doe valiantly: for he shall tread downe our enemies. 
\c 61

\v 1 To him that excelleth on Neginoth. A Psalme of David. Heare my cry, O God: giue eare vnto my prayer. 
\v 2 From the endes of the earth will I crye vnto thee: when mine heart is opprest, bring me vpon the rocke that is higher then I. 
\v 3 For thou hast bene mine hope, and a strong tower against the enemie. 
\v 4 I will dwell in thy Tabernacle for euer, and my trust shall be vnder the couering of thy wings. Selah. 
\v 5 For thou, O God, hast heard my desires: thou hast giuen an heritage vnto those that feare thy Name. 
\v 6 Thou shalt giue the King a long life: his yeeres shalbe as many ages. 
\v 7 Hee shall dwell before God for euer: prepare mercie and faithfulnes that they may preserue him. 
\v 8 So will I alway sing prayse vnto thy Name in performing dayly my vowes.

\v 1 To the excelletn musician Ieduthun. A Psalme of David. Yet my soule keepeth silence vnto God: of him commeth my saluation. 
\v 2 Yet he is my strength and my saluation, and my defence: therefore I shall not much be mooued. 
\v 3 How long wil ye imagine mischiefe against a man? ye shalbe all slaine: ye shalbe as a bowed wall, or as a wall shaken. 
\v 4 Yet they consult to cast him downe from his dignitie: their delight is in lies, they blesse with their mouthes, but curse with their hearts. Selah. 
\v 5 Yet my soule keepe thou silence vnto God: for mine hope is in him. 
\v 6 Yet is hee my strength, and my saluation, and my defence: therefore I shall not be mooued. 
\v 7 In God is my saluation and my glory, the rocke of my strength: in God is my trust. 
\v 8 Trust in him alway, ye people: powre out your hearts before him, for God is our hope. Selah. 
\v 9 Yet the children of men are vanitie, the chiefe men are lies: to lay them vpon a balance they are altogether lighter then vanitie. 
\v 10 Trust not in oppression nor in robberie: be not vaine: if riches increase, set not your heart thereon. 
\v 11 God spake once or twise, I haue heard it, that power belongeth vnto God, 
\v 12 And to thee, O Lord, mercie: for thou rewardest euery one according to his worke. 
\c 63  
\p
\v 1 A Psalme of David. When he was in the wildernesse of Judah. O God, thou art my God, earely will I seeke thee: my soule thirsteth for thee: my flesh longeth greatly after thee in a barren and drye land without water. 
\v 2 Thus I beholde thee as in the Sanctuarie, when I beholde thy power and thy glorie. 
\v 3 For thy louing kindnesse is better then life: therefore my lippes shall prayse thee. 
\v 4 Thus will I magnifie thee all my life, and lift vp mine hands in thy name. 
\v 5 My soule shalbe satisfied, as with marowe and fatnesse, and my mouth shall praise thee with ioyfull lippes, 
\v 6 When I remember thee on my bedde, and when I thinke vpon thee in the night watches. 
\v 7 Because thou hast bene mine helper, therefore vnder the shadow of thy wings wil I reioyce. 
\v 8 My soule cleaueth vnto thee: for thy right hand vpholdeth me. 
\v 9 Therefore they that seeke my soule to destroy it, they shall goe into the lowest partes of the earth. 
\v 10 They shall cast him downe with the edge of the sword, and they shall be a portion for foxes. 
\v 11 But the King shall reioyce in God, and all that sweare by him shall reioyce in him: for the mouth of them that speake lyes, shall be stopped.

\v 1 To him that excelleth. A Psalme of David. Heare my voyce, O God, in my prayer: preserue my life from feare of the enemie. 
\v 2 Hide me from the conspiracie of the wicked, and from the rage of the workers of iniquitie. 
\v 3 Which haue whette their tongue like a sword, and shot for their arrowes bitter wordes. 
\v 4 To shoote at the vpright in secrete: they shoote at him suddenly, and feare not. 
\v 5 They encourage themselues in a wicked purpose: they commune together to lay snares priuilie, and say, Who shall see them? 
\v 6 They haue sought out iniquities, and haue accomplished that which they sought out, euen euery one his secret thoughtes, and the depth of his heart. 
\v 7 But God will shoote an arrowe at them suddenly: their strokes shalbe at once. 
\v 8 They shall cause their owne tongue to fall vpon them: and whosoeuer shall see them, shall flee away. 
\v 9 And all men shall see it, and declare the worke of God, and they shall vnderstand, what he hath wrought. 
\v 10 But the righteous shall be glad in the Lord, and trust in him: and all that are vpright of heart, shall reioyce.

\v 1 To him that excelleth. A Psalme or song of David. O God, praise waiteth for thee in Zion, and vnto thee shall the vowe be perfourmed. 
\v 2 Because thou hearest the prayer, vnto thee shall all flesh come. 
\v 3 Wicked deedes haue preuailed against me: but thou wilt be mercifull vnto our transgressions. 
\v 4 Blessed is he, whom thou chusest and causest to come to thee: he shall dwell in thy courtes, and we shall be satisfied with the pleasures of thine House, euen of thine holy Temple. 
\v 5 O God of our saluation, thou wilt answere vs with fearefull signes in thy righteousnes, O thou the hope of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are farre off in the sea. 
\v 6 He stablisheth the mountaines by his power: and is girded about with strength. 
\v 7 He appeaseth the noyse of the seas and the noyse of the waues thereof, and the tumults of the people. 
\v 8 They also, that dwell in the vttermost parts of the earth, shalbe afraide of thy signes: thou shalt make the East and the West to reioyce. 
\v 9 Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou makest it very riche: the Riuer of God is full of water: thou preparest them corne: for so thou appointest it. 
\v 10 Thou waterest abundantly the furrowes thereof: thou causest the raine to descende into the valleies thereof: thou makest it soft with showres, and blessest the bud thereof. 
\v 11 Thou crownest ye yeere with thy goodnesse, and thy steppes droppe fatnesse. 
\v 12 They drop vpon the pastures of the wildernesse: and the hils shalbe compassed with gladnes. 
\v 13 The pastures are clad with sheepe: the valleis also shalbe couered with corne: therefore they shoute for ioye, and sing.

\v 1 To him that excelleth. A song or Psalme. Rejoice in God, all ye inhabitants of the earth. 
\v 2 Sing forth the glory of his name: make his praise glorious. 
\v 3 Say vnto God, Howe terrible art thou in thy workes! through the greatnesse of thy power shall thine enemies be in subiection vnto thee. 
\v 4 All the worlde shall worship thee, and sing vnto thee, euen sing of thy Name. Selah. 
\v 5 Come and beholde the workes of God: he is terrible in his doing towarde the sonnes of men. 
\v 6 He hath turned the Sea into drie land: they passe through the riuer on foote: there did we reioyce in him. 
\v 7 He ruleth the worlde with his power: his eyes beholde the nations: the rebellious shall not exalt them selues. Selah. 
\v 8 Prayse our God, ye people, and make the voyce of his prayse to be heard. 
\v 9 Which holdeth our soules in life, and suffereth not our feete to slippe. 
\v 10 For thou, O God, hast proued vs, thou hast tryed vs as siluer is tryed. 
\v 11 Thou hast brought vs into the snare, and layed a strait chaine vpon our loynes. 
\v 12 Thou hast caused men to ryde ouer our heads: we went into fire and into water, but thou broughtest vs out into a welthie place. 
\v 13 I will go into thine House with burnt offrings, and will pay thee my vowes, 
\v 14 Which my lippes haue promised, and my mouth hath spoken in mine affliction. 
\v 15 I will offer vnto thee the burnt offerings of fat rammes with incense: I will prepare bullocks and goates. Selah. 
\v 16 Come and hearken, all ye that feare God, and I will tell you what he hath done to my soule. 
\v 17 I called vnto him with my mouth, and he was exalted with my tongue. 
\v 18 If I regard wickednesse in mine heart, the Lord will not heare me. 
\v 19 But God hath heard me, and considered the voyce of my prayer. 
\v 20 Praysed be God, which hath not put backe my prayer, nor his mercie from me. 
\c 67  
\p
\v 1 To him that excelleth on Neginoth. A Psalme or song. God be mercifull vnto vs, and blesse vs, and cause his face to shine among vs. Selah. 
\v 2 That they may know thy way vpon earth, and thy sauing health among all nations. 
\v 3 Let the people prayse thee, O God: let all the people prayse thee. 
\v 4 Let the people be glad and reioyce: for thou shalt iudge the people righteously, and gouerne the nations vpon the earth. Selah. 
\v 5 Let the people prayse thee, O God: let all the people prayse thee. 
\v 6 Then shall the earth bring foorth her increase, and God, euen our God shall blesse vs. 
\v 7 God shall blesse vs, and all the endes of the earth shall feare him.

\v 1 To him that excelleth. A Psalme or song of David. God will arise, and his enemies shalbe scattered: they also that hate him, shall flee before him. 
\v 2 As the smoke vanisheth, so shalt thou driue them away: and as waxe melteth before the fire, so shall the wicked perish at the presence of God. 
\v 3 But the righteous shalbe glad, and reioyce before God: yea, they shall leape for ioye. 
\v 4 Sing vnto God, and sing prayses vnto his name: exalt him that rideth vpon the heauens, in his Name Iah, and reioyce before him. 
\v 5 He is a Father of the fatherlesse, and a Iudge of the widowes, euen God in his holy habitation. 
\v 6 God maketh the solitarie to dwell in families, and deliuereth them that were prisoners in stocks: but the rebellious shall dwell in a dry land. 
\v 7 O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people: when thou wentest through the wildernesse, (Selah) 
\v 8 The earth shooke, and the heauens dropped at the presence of this God: euen Sinai was moued at the presence of God, euen the God of Israel. 
\v 9 Thou, O God, sendest a gracious raine vpon thine inheritance, and thou didest refresh it when it was wearie. 
\v 10 Thy Congregation dwelled therein: for thou, O God, hast of thy goodnesse prepared it for the poore. 
\v 11 The Lord gaue matter to the women to tell of the great armie. 
\v 12 Kings of the armies did flee: they did flee, and she that remained in the house, deuided the spoyle. 
\v 13 Though ye haue lien among pots, yet shall ye be as the winges of a doue that is couered with siluer, and whose fethers are like yelowe golde. 
\v 14 When the Almightie scattered Kings in it, it was white as the snowe in Zalmon. 
\v 15 The mountaine of God is like the mountaine of Bashan: it is an high Mountaine, as mount Bashan. 
\v 16 Why leape ye, ye high mountaines? as for this Mountaine, God deliteth to dwell in it: yea, the Lord will dwell in it for euer. 
\v 17 The charets of God are twentie thousande thousand Angels, and the Lord is among them, as in the Sanctuarie of Sinai. 
\v 18 Thou art gone vp on high: thou hast led captiuitie captiue, and receiued giftes for men: yea, euen the rebellious hast thou led, that the Lord God might dwell there. 
\v 19 Praysed be the Lord, euen the God of our saluation, which ladeth vs dayly with benefites. Selah. 
\v 20 This is our God, euen the God that saueth vs: and to the Lord God belong the issues of death. 
\v 21 Surely God will wound the head of his enemies, and the hearie pate of him that walketh in his sinnes. 
\v 22 The Lord hath sayde, I will bring my people againe from Bashan: I will bring them againe from the depths of the Sea: 
\v 23 That thy foote may bee dipped in blood, and the tongue of thy dogges in the blood of the enemies, euen in it. 
\v 24 They haue seene, O God, thy goings, the goings of my God, and my King, which art in the Sanctuarie. 
\v 25 The singers went before, the players of instruments after: in the middes were the maides playing with timbrels. 
\v 26 Praise yee God in the assemblies, and the Lord, ye that are of the fountaine of Israel. 
\v 27 There was litle Beniamin with their ruler, and the princes of Iudah with their assemblie, the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of Naphtali. 
\v 28 Thy God hath appointed thy strength: stablish, O God, that, which thou hast wrought in vs, 
\v 29 Out of thy Temple vpon Ierusalem: and Kings shall bring presents vnto thee. 
\v 30 Destroy the company of the spearemen, and multitude of the mightie bulles with the calues of the people, that tread vnder feete pieces of siluer: scatter the people that delite in warre. 
\v 31 Then shall the princes come out of Egypt: Ethiopia shall hast to stretche her hands vnto God. 
\v 32 Sing vnto God, O yee kingdomes of the earth: sing praise vnto the Lord, (Selah) 
\v 33 To him that rideth vpon ye most high heauens, which were from the beginning: beholde, he will send out by his voice a mightie sound. 
\v 34 Ascribe the power to God: for his maiestie is vpon Israel, and his strength is in the cloudes.

\v 1 To him that excelleth upon Shoshannim. A Psalme of David. Save mee, O God: for the waters are entred euen to my soule. 
\v 2 I sticke fast in the deepe myre, where no staie is: I am come into deepe waters, and the streames runne ouer me. 
\v 3 I am wearie of crying: my throte is drie: mine eyes faile, whiles I waite for my God. 
\v 4 They that hate mee without a cause, are moe then the heares of mine heade: they that would destroy mee, and are mine enemies falsly, are mightie, so that I restored that which I tooke not. 
\v 5 O God, thou knowest my foolishnesse, and my fautes are not hid from thee. 
\v 6 Let not them that trust in thee, O Lord God of hostes, be ashamed for me: let not those that seeke thee, be confounded through mee, O God of Israel. 
\v 7 For thy sake haue I suffred reproofe: shame hath couered my face. 
\v 8 I am become a stranger vnto my brethren, euen an aliant vnto my mothers sonnes. 
\v 9 For the zeale of thine house hath eaten mee, and the rebukes of them that rebuked thee, are fallen vpon me. 
\v 10 I wept and my soule fasted, but that was to my reproofe. 
\v 11 I put on a sacke also: and I became a prouerbe vnto them. 
\v 12 They that sate in the gate, spake of mee, and the drunkards sang of me. 
\v 13 But Lord, I make my praier vnto thee in an acceptable time, euen in the multitude of thy mercie: O God, heare me in the trueth of thy saluation. 
\v 14 Deliuer mee out of the myre, that I sinke not: let me be deliuered from them that hate me, and out of the deepe waters. 
\v 15 Let not the water flood drowne mee, neither let the deepe swallowe me vp: and let not the pit shut her mouth vpon me. 
\v 16 Heare me, O Lord, for thy louing kindnes is good: turne vnto me according to ye multitude of thy tender mercies. 
\v 17 And hide not thy face from thy seruant, for I am in trouble: make haste and heare me. 
\v 18 Draw neere vnto my soule and redeeme it: deliuer me because of mine enemies. 
\v 19 Thou hast knowen my reproofe and my shame, and my dishonour: all mine aduersaries are before thee. 
\v 20 Rebuke hath broken mine heart, and I am full of heauinesse, and I looked for some to haue pitie on me, but there was none: and for comforters, but I found none. 
\v 21 For they gaue me gall in my meate, and in my thirst they gaue me vineger to drinke. 
\v 22 Let their table be a snare before them, and their prosperitie their ruine. 
\v 23 Let their eyes be blinded that they see not: and make their loynes alway to tremble. 
\v 24 Powre out thine anger vpon them, and let thy wrathfull displeasure take them. 
\v 25 Let their habitation be voide, and let none dwell in their tents. 
\v 26 For they persecute him, whome thou hast smitten: and they adde vnto the sorrowe of them, whome thou hast wounded. 
\v 27 Laie iniquitie vpon their iniquitie, and let them not come into thy righteousnesse. 
\v 28 Let them be put out of the booke of life, neither let them be written with the righteous. 
\v 29 When I am poore and in heauinesse, thine helpe, O God, shall exalt me. 
\v 30 I will praise the Name of God with a song, and magnifie him with thankesgiuing. 
\v 31 This also shall please the Lord better then a yong bullocke, that hath hornes and hoofes. 
\v 32 The humble shall see this, and they that seeke God, shalbe glad, and your heart shall liue. 
\v 33 For the Lord heareth the poore, and despiseth not his prisoners. 
\v 34 Let heauen and earth praise him: the seas and all that moueth in them. 
\v 35 For God will saue Zion, and builde the cities of Iudah, that men may dwell there and haue it in possession. 
\v 36 The seede also of his seruants shall inherit it: and they that loue his name, shall dwel therein.

\v 1 To him excelleth. A Psalme of David to put in remembrance. O God, haste thee to deliuer mee: make haste to helpe me, O Lord. 
\v 2 Let them be confounded and put to shame, that seeke my soule: let them bee turned backewarde and put to rebuke, that desire mine hurt. 
\v 3 Let them be turned backe for a rewarde of their shame, which said, Aha, aha. 
\v 4 But let all those that seeke thee, be ioyfull and glad in thee, and let all that loue thy saluation, say alwaies, God be praised. 
\v 5 Nowe I am poore and needie: O God, make haste to me: thou art mine helper, and my deliuerer: O Lord, make no tarying. 
\c 71  
\p
\v 1 In thee, O Lord, I trust: let me neuer be ashamed. 
\v 2 Rescue mee and deliuer me in thy righteousnes: incline thine eare vnto me and saue me. 
\v 3 Be thou my strong rocke, whereunto I may alway resort: thou hast giuen commandement to saue me: for thou art my rocke, and my fortresse. 
\v 4 Deliuer mee, O my God, out of the hande of the wicked: out of the hande of the euill and cruell man. 
\v 5 For thou art mine hope, O Lord God, euen my trust from my youth. 
\v 6 Vpon thee haue I beene stayed from the wombe: thou art he that tooke me out of my mothers bowels: my praise shalbe alwaies of thee. 
\v 7 I am become as it were a monster vnto many: but thou art my sure trust. 
\v 8 Let my mouth be filled with thy praise, and with thy glory euery day. 
\v 9 Cast mee not off in the time of age: forsake me not when my strength faileth. 
\v 10 For mine enemies speake of mee, and they that lay waite for my soule, take their counsell together, 
\v 11 Saying, God hath forsaken him: pursue and take him, for there is none to deliuer him. 
\v 12 Goe not farre from me, O God: my God, haste thee to helpe me. 
\v 13 Let them be confounded and consumed that are against my soule: let them be couered with reproofe and confusion, that seeke mine hurt. 
\v 14 But I will waite continually, and will praise thee more and more. 
\v 15 My mouth shall daily rehearse thy righteousnesse, and thy saluation: for I knowe not the nomber. 
\v 16 I will goe forwarde in the strength of the Lord God, and will make mention of thy righteousnesse, euen of thine onely. 
\v 17 O God, thou hast taught me from my youth euen vntill nowe: therefore will I tell of thy wonderous workes, 
\v 18 Yea, euen vnto mine olde age and graie head, O God: forsake me not, vntill I haue declared thine arme vnto this generation, and thy power to all them, that shall come. 
\v 19 And thy righteousnes, O God, I wil exalt on high: for thou hast done great thinges: O God, who is like vnto thee! 
\v 20 Which hast shewed me great troubles and aduersities, but thou wilt returne, and reuiue me, and wilt come againe, and take mee vp from the depth of the earth. 
\v 21 Thou wilt increase mine honour, and returne and comfort me. 
\v 22 Therefore will I praise thee for thy faithfulnesse, O God, vpon instrument and viole: vnto thee will I sing vpon the harpe, O Holy one of Israel. 
\v 23 My lippes will reioyce when I sing vnto thee, and my soule, which thou hast deliuered. 
\v 24 My tongue also shall talke of thy righteousnesse daily: for they are confounded and brought vnto shame, that seeke mine hurt.

\v 1 A Psalme of Salomon. Give thy iudgements to the King, O God, and thy righteousnesse to the Kings sonne. 
\v 2 Then shall he iudge thy people in righteousnesse, and thy poore with equitie. 
\v 3 The mountaines and the hilles shall bring peace to the people by iustice. 
\v 4 He shall iudge the poore of the people: he shall saue the children of the needie, and shall subdue the oppressor. 
\v 5 They shall feare thee as long as the sunne and moone endureth, from generatio to generation. 
\v 6 He shall come downe like the rayne vpon the mowen grasse, and as the showres that water the earth. 
\v 7 In his dayes shall the righteous florish, and abundance of peace shalbe so long as the moone endureth. 
\v 8 His dominion shall be also from sea to sea, and from the Riuer vnto the endes of the land. 
\v 9 They that dwell in ye wildernes, shall kneele before him, and his enemies shall licke the dust. 
\v 10 The Kings of Tarshish and of the yles shall bring presents: the Kings of Sheba and Seba shall bring giftes. 
\v 11 Yea, all Kings shall worship him: all nations shall serue him. 
\v 12 For he shall deliuer the poore when he cryeth: the needie also, and him that hath no helper. 
\v 13 He shalbe mercifull to the poore and needie, and shall preserue the soules of the poore. 
\v 14 He shall redeeme their soules from deceite and violence, and deare shall their blood be in his sight. 
\v 15 Yea, he shall liue, and vnto him shall they giue of the golde of Sheba: they shall also pray for him continually, and dayly blesse him. 
\v 16 An handfull of corne shall be sowen in the earth, euen in the toppe of the mountaines, and the fruite thereof shall shake like the trees of Lebanon: and the children shall florish out of the citie like the grasse of the earth. 
\v 17 His name shall be for euer: his name shall indure as long as the sunne: all nations shall blesse him, and be blessed in him. 
\v 18 Blessed be the Lord God, euen the God of Israel, which onely doeth wonderous things. 
\v 19 And blessed be his glorious Name for euer: and let all the earth be filled with his glorie. So be it, euen so be it. HERE END THE prayers of Dauid, the sonne of Ishai.

\v 1 A Psalme committed to Asaph. Yet God is good to Israel: euen, to the pure in heart. 
\v 2 As for me, my feete were almost gone: my steps had well neere slipt. 
\v 3 For I feared at the foolish, when I sawe the prosperitie of the wicked. 
\v 4 For there are no bandes in their death, but they are lustie and strong. 
\v 5 They are not in trouble as other men, neither are they plagued with other men. 
\v 6 Therefore pride is as a chayne vnto them, and crueltie couereth them as a garment. 
\v 7 Their eyes stande out for fatnesse: they haue more then heart can wish. 
\v 8 They are licentious, and speake wickedly of their oppression: they talke presumptuously. 
\v 9 They set their mouth against heauen, and their tongue walketh through the earth. 
\v 10 Therefore his people turne hither: for waters of a full cup are wrung out to them. 
\v 11 And they say, Howe doeth God know it? or is there knowledge in the most High? 
\v 12 Lo, these are the wicked, yet prosper they alway, and increase in riches. 
\v 13 Certainely I haue clensed mine heart in vaine, and washed mine hands in innocencie. 
\v 14 For dayly haue I bene punished, and chastened euery morning. 
\v 15 If I say, I will iudge thus, beholde the generation of thy children: I haue trespassed. 
\v 16 Then thought I to know this, but it was too painefull for me, 
\v 17 Vntill I went into the Sanctuarie of God: then vnderstoode I their ende. 
\v 18 Surely thou hast set them in slipperie places, and castest them downe into desolation. 
\v 19 How suddenly are they destroyed, perished and horribly consumed, 
\v 20 As a dreame when one awaketh! O Lord, when thou raisest vs vp, thou shalt make their image despised. 
\v 21 Certainely mine heart was vexed, and I was pricked in my reines: 
\v 22 So foolish was I and ignorant: I was a beast before thee. 
\v 23 Yet I was alway with thee: thou hast holden me by my right hand. 
\v 24 Thou wilt guide me by thy counsell, and afterward receiue me to glory. 
\v 25 Whom haue I in heauen but thee? and I haue desired none in the earth with thee. 
\v 26 My flesh fayleth and mine heart also: but God is the strength of mine heart, and my portion for euer. 
\v 27 For loe, they that withdrawe themselues from thee, shall perish: thou destroyest all them that goe a whoring from thee. 
\v 28 As for me, it is good for me to draw neere to God: therefore I haue put my trust in the Lord God, that I may declare all thy workes.

\v 1 A Psalme to give instruction, committed to Asaph. O God, why hast thou put vs away for euer? why is thy wrath kindled against the sheepe of thy pasture? 
\v 2 Thinke vpon thy Congregation, which thou hast possessed of olde, and on the rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed, and on this mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt. 
\v 3 Lift vp thy strokes, that thou mayest for euer destroy euery enemie that doeth euill to the Sanctuarie. 
\v 4 Thine aduersaries roare in the middes of thy Congregation, and set vp their banners for signes. 
\v 5 He that lifted the axes vpon the thicke trees, was renowmed, as one, that brought a thing to perfection: 
\v 6 But nowe they breake downe the carued worke thereof with axes and hammers. 
\v 7 They haue cast thy Sanctuarie into the fire, and rased it to the grounde, and haue defiled the dwelling place of thy Name. 
\v 8 They saide in their hearts, Let vs destroy them altogether: they haue burnt all the Synagogues of God in the land. 
\v 9 We see not our signes: there is not one Prophet more, nor any with vs that knoweth howe long. 
\v 10 O God, howe long shall the aduersarie reproche thee? shall the enemie blaspheme thy Name for euer? 
\v 11 Why withdrawest thou thine hand, euen thy right hand? drawe it out of thy bosome, and consume them. 
\v 12 Euen God is my King of olde, working saluation in the middes of the earth. 
\v 13 Thou didest deuide the sea by thy power: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters. 
\v 14 Thou brakest the head of Liuiathan in pieces, and gauest him to be meate for the people in wildernesse. 
\v 15 Thou brakest vp the fountaine and riuer: thou dryedst vp mightie riuers. 
\v 16 The day is thine, and the night is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sunne. 
\v 17 Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter. 
\v 18 Remember this, that the enemie hath reproched the Lord, and the foolish people hath blasphemed thy Name. 
\v 19 Giue not the soule of thy turtle doue vnto the beast, and forget not the Congregation of thy poore for euer. 
\v 20 Consider thy couenant: for the darke places of the earth are full of the habitations of the cruell. 
\v 21 Oh let not the oppressed returne ashamed, but let the poore and needie prayse thy Name. 
\v 22 Arise, O God: mainteine thine owne cause: remember thy dayly reproche by the foolish man. 
\v 23 Forget not the voyce of thine enemies: for the tumult of them, that rise against thee, ascendeth continually.

\v 1 To him that excelleth. Destroy not. A Psalme or song committed toAsaph. We will prayse thee, O God, we will prayse thee, for thy Name is neere: therefore they will declare thy wonderous workes. 
\v 2 When I shall take a conuenient time, I will iudge righteously. 
\v 3 The earth and all the inhabitantes thereof are dissolued: but I will establish the pillars of it. Selah. 
\v 4 I saide vnto the foolish, Be not so foolish, and to the wicked, Lift not vp the horne. 
\v 5 Lift not vp your horne on high, neither speake with a stiffe necke. 
\v 6 For to come to preferment is neither from the East, nor from the West, nor from the South, 
\v 7 But God is the iudge: he maketh lowe and he maketh hie. 
\v 8 For in the hand of the Lord is a cup, and the wine is red: it is full mixt, and he powreth out of the same: surely all the wicked of the earth shall wring out and drinke the dregges thereof. 
\v 9 But I will declare for euer, and sing prayses vnto the God of Iaakob. 
\v 10 All the hornes of the wicked also will I breake: but the hornes of the righteous shalbe exalted.

\v 3 There brake he the arrowes of the bowe, the shielde and the sword and the battell. Selah. 
\v 4 Thou art more bright and puissant, then the mountaines of pray. 
\v 5 The stout hearted are spoyled: they haue slept their sleepe, and all the men of strength haue not found their hands. 
\v 6 At thy rebuke, O God of Iaakob, both the chariot and horse are cast a sleepe. 
\v 7 Thou, euen thou art to be feared: and who shall stand in thy sight, when thou art angrie! 
\v 8 Thou didest cause thy iudgement to bee heard from heauen: therefore the earth feared and was still, 
\v 9 When thou, O God, arose to iudgement, to helpe all the meeke of the earth. Selah. 
\v 10 Surely the rage of man shall turne to thy praise: the remnant of the rage shalt thou restrayne. 
\v 11 Vowe and performe vnto the Lord your God, all ye that be rounde about him: let them bring presents vnto him that ought to be feared. 
\v 12 He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the Kings of the earth.

\v 1 For the excellent musician Ieduthun. A Psalme committed to Asaph. My voyce came to God, when I cryed: my voyce came to God, and he heard me. 
\v 2 In the day of my trouble I sought ye Lord: my sore ranne and ceased not in the night: my soule refused comfort. 
\v 3 I did thinke vpon God, and was troubled: I praied, and my spirit was full of anguish. Selah. 
\v 4 Thou keepest mine eyes waking: I was astonied and could not speake. 
\v 5 Then I considered the daies of olde, and the yeeres of ancient time. 
\v 6 I called to remembrance my song in the night: I communed with mine owne heart, and my spirit searched diligently. 
\v 7 Will the Lord absent him selfe for euer? and will he shewe no more fauour? 
\v 8 Is his mercie cleane gone for euer? doeth his promise faile for euermore? 
\v 9 Hath God forgotten to be mercifull? hath he shut vp his teder mercies in displeasure? Selah. 
\v 10 And I sayde, This is my death: yet I remembred the yeeres of the right hand of the most High. 
\v 11 I remembred the workes of the Lord: certainely I remembred thy wonders of olde. 
\v 12 I did also meditate all thy woorkes, and did deuise of thine actes, saying, 
\v 13 Thy way, O God, is in the Sanctuarie: who is so great a God as our God! 
\v 14 Thou art ye God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy power among the people. 
\v 15 Thou hast redeemed thy people with thine arme, euen the sonnes of Iaakob and Ioseph. Selah. 
\v 16 The waters sawe thee, O God: the waters sawe thee, and were afraide: yea, the depths trembled. 
\v 17 The cloudes powred out water: the heauens gaue a sounde: yea, thine arrowes went abroade. 
\v 18 The voyce of thy thunder was rounde about: the lightnings lightened the worlde: the earth trembled and shooke. 
\v 19 Thy way is in the Sea, and thy paths in the great waters, and thy footesteps are not knowen. 
\v 20 Thou diddest leade thy people like sheepe by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

\v 2 I will open my mouth in a parable: I will declare high sentences of olde. 
\v 3 Which we haue heard and knowen, and our fathers haue tolde vs. 
\v 4 Wee will not hide them from their children but to the generation to come we wil shewe the praises of the Lord his power also, and his wonderful woorkes that he hath done: 
\v 5 How he established a testimonie in Iaakob, and ordeined a Law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they shoulde teache their children: 
\v 6 That the posteritie might knowe it, and the children, which should be borne, should stand vp, and declare it to their children: 
\v 7 That they might set their hope on God, and not forget the workes of God but keepe his commandements: 
\v 8 And not to bee as their fathers, a disobedient and rebellious generation: a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirite was not faithfull vnto God. 
\v 9 The children of Ephraim being armed and shooting with the bowe, turned backe in the day of battell. 
\v 10 They kept not the couenant of God, but refused to walke in his Lawe, 
\v 11 And forgate his Actes, and his wonderfull woorkes that he had shewed them. 
\v 12 Hee did marueilous thinges in the sight of their fathers in the lande of Egypt: euen in the fielde of Zoan. 
\v 13 He deuided the Sea, and led them through: he made also the waters to stand as an heape. 
\v 14 In the day time also hee led them with a cloude, and all the night with a light of fire. 
\v 15 He claue the rockes in the wildernes, and gaue them drinke as of the great depths. 
\v 16 He brought floods also out of the stonie rocke; so that hee made the waters to descend like the riuers. 
\v 17 Yet they sinned stil against him, and prouoked the Highest in the wildernesse, 
\v 18 And tempted God in their heartes in requiring meate for their lust. 
\v 19 They spake against God also, saying, Can God prepare a table in the wildernesse? 
\v 20 Behold, he smote the rocke, that the water gushed out, and the streames ouerflowed: can hee giue bread also? or prepare flesh for his people? 
\v 21 Therefore the Lord heard and was angrie, and the fire was kindled in Iaakob, and also wrath came vpon Israel, 
\v 22 Because they beleeued not in God, and trusted not in his helpe. 
\v 23 Yet he had comanded the clouds aboue, and had opened the doores of heauen, 
\v 24 And had rained downe MAN vpon them for to eate, and had giuen them of the wheate of heauen. 
\v 25 Man did eate the bread of Angels: hee sent them meate ynough. 
\v 26 He caused the Eastwinde to passe in the heauen, and through his power he brought in the Southwinde. 
\v 27 Hee rained flesh also vpon them as dust, and feathered foule as the sand of the sea. 
\v 28 And hee made it fall in the middes of their campe euen round about their habitations. 
\v 29 So they did eate and were well filled: for he gaue them their desire. 
\v 30 They were not turned from their lust, but the meate was yet in their mouthes, 
\v 31 When the wrath of God came euen vpon them, and slew the strongest of them, and smote downe the chosen men in Israel. 
\v 32 For all this, they sinned stil, and beleeued not his wonderous woorkes. 
\v 33 Therefore their daies did hee consume in vanitie, and their yeeres hastily. 
\v 34 And when hee slewe them, they sought him and they returned, and sought God earely. 
\v 35 And they remembred that God was their strength, and the most high God their redeemer. 
\v 36 But they flattered him with their mouth, and dissembled with him with their tongue. 
\v 37 For their heart was not vpright with him: neither were they faithfull in his couenant. 
\v 38 Yet he being merciful forgaue their iniquitie, and destroied them not, but oft times called backe his anger, and did not stirre vp all his wrath. 
\v 39 For he remembered that they were flesh: yea, a winde that passeth and commeth not againe. 
\v 40 How oft did they prouoke him in the wildernes? and grieue him in the desert? 
\v 41 Yea, they returned, and tempted God, and limited the Holie one of Israel. 
\v 42 They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he deliuered them from the enemie, 
\v 43 Nor him that set his signes in Egypt, and his wonders in the fielde of Zoan, 
\v 44 And turned their riuers into blood, and their floods, that they could not drinke. 
\v 45 Hee sent a swarme of flies among them, which deuoured them, and frogs, which destroyed them. 
\v 46 He gaue also their fruites vnto the caterpiller, and their labour vnto the grassehopper. 
\v 47 He destroied their vines with haile, and their wilde figge trees with the hailestone. 
\v 48 He gaue their cattell also to the haile, and their flockes to the thunderboltes. 
\v 49 Hee cast vpon them the fiercenesse of his anger, indignation and wrath, and vexation by the sending out of euill Angels. 
\v 50 He made a way to his anger: he spared not their soule from death, but gaue their life to the pestilence, 
\v 51 And smote al the firstborne in Egypt, euen the beginning of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham. 
\v 52 But hee made his people to goe out like sheepe, and led them in the wildernes like a flocke. 
\v 53 Yea, he caried them out safely, and they feared not, and the Sea couered their enemies. 
\v 54 And he brought them vnto the borders of his Sanctuarie: euen to this Mountaine, which his right hand purchased. 
\v 55 He cast out the heathe also before them, and caused them to fall to the lot of his inheritance, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tabernacles. 
\v 56 Yet they tempted, and prouoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies, 
\v 57 But turned backe and delt falsely like their fathers: they turned like a deceitfull bowe. 
\v 58 And they prouoked him to anger with their high places, and mooued him to wrath with their grauen images. 
\v 59 God heard this and was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel, 
\v 60 So that hee forsooke the habitation of Shilo, euen the Tabernacle where hee dwelt among men, 
\v 61 And deliuered his power into captiuitie, and his beautie into the enemies hand. 
\v 62 And hee gaue vp his people to the sworde, and was angrie with his inheritance. 
\v 63 The fire deuoured their chosen men, and their maides were not praised. 
\v 64 Their Priestes fell by the sworde, and their widowes lamented not. 
\v 65 But the Lord awaked as one out of sleepe, and as a strong man that after his wine crieth out, 
\v 66 And smote his enemies in the hinder parts, and put them to a perpetuall shame. 
\v 67 Yet he refused the tabernacle of Ioseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim: 
\v 68 But chose the tribe of Iudah, and mount Zion which he loued. 
\v 69 And he built his Sanctuarie as an high palace, like the earth, which he stablished for euer. 
\v 70 He chose Dauid also his seruant, and tooke him from the shepefolds. 
\v 71 Euen from behinde the ewes with yong brought he him to feede his people in Iaakob, and his inheritance in Israel. 
\v 72 So he fed them according to the simplicitie of his heart, and guided them by the discretion of his hands.

\v 1 A Psalme committed to Asaph. O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance: thine holy Temple haue they defiled, and made Ierusalem heapes of stones. 
\v 2 The dead bodies of thy seruats haue they giuen to be meat vnto foules of ye heauen: and the flesh of thy Saintes vnto the beastes of the earth. 
\v 3 Their blood haue they shead like waters rounde about Ierusalem, and there was none to burie them. 
\v 4 Wee are a reproche to our neighbours, euen a scorne and derision vnto them that are round about vs. 
\v 5 Lord, howe long wilt thou be angrie, for euer? shall thy gelousie burne like fire? 
\v 6 Powre out thy wrath vpon the heathen that haue not knowen thee, and vpon the kingdomes that haue not called vpon thy Name. 
\v 7 For they haue deuoured Iaakob and made his dwelling place desolate. 
\v 8 Remember not against vs the former iniquities, but make haste and let thy tender mercies preuent vs: for we are in great miserie. 
\v 9 Helpe vs, O God of our saluation, for the glorie of thy Name, and deliuer vs, and be mercifull vnto our sinnes for thy Names sake. 
\v 10 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God? let him be knowen among the heathen in our sight by the vengeance of the blood of thy seruants that is shed. 
\v 11 Let the sighing of the prisoners come before thee: according to thy mightie arme preserue the children of death, 
\v 12 And render to our neighbours seuen folde into their bosome their reproche, wherewith they haue reproched thee, O Lord. 
\v 13 So wee thy people, and sheepe of thy pasture shall praise thee for euer: and from generation to generation we will set foorth thy praise.

\v 1 To him that excelleth on Shoshannim Eduth. A Psalme committed to Asaph. Heare, O thou Shepheard of Israel, thou that leadest Ioseph like sheepe: shewe thy brightnes, thou that sittest betweene the Cherubims. 
\v 2 Before Ephraim and Beniamin and Manasseh stirre vp thy strength, and come to helpe vs. 
\v 3 Turne vs againe, O God, and cause thy face to shine that we may be saued. 
\v 4 O Lord God of hostes, how long wilt thou be angrie against the prayer of thy people? 
\v 5 Thou hast fedde them with the bread of teares, and giuen them teares to drinke with great measure. 
\v 6 Thou hast made vs a strife vnto our neighbours, and our enemies laugh at vs among themselues. 
\v 7 Turne vs againe, O God of hostes: cause thy face to shine, and we shalbe saued. 
\v 8 Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it. 
\v 9 Thou madest roume for it, and didest cause it to take roote, and it filled the land. 
\v 10 The mountaines were couered with the shadowe of it, and the boughes thereof were like the goodly cedars. 
\v 11 Shee stretched out her branches vnto the Sea, and her boughes vnto the Riuer. 
\v 12 Why hast thou then broken downe her hedges, so that all they, which passe by the way, haue plucked her? 
\v 13 The wilde bore out of the wood hath destroyed it, and the wilde beastes of the fielde haue eaten it vp. 
\v 14 Returne we beseech thee, O God of hostes: looke downe from heauen and beholde and visite this vine, 
\v 15 And the vineyard, that thy right hand hath planted, and the young vine, which thou madest strong for thy selfe. 
\v 16 It is burnt with fire and cut downe: and they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance. 
\v 17 Let thine hande be vpon the man of thy right hande, and vpon the sonne of man, whome thou madest strong for thine owne selfe. 
\v 18 So will not we goe backe from thee: reuiue thou vs, and we shall call vpon thy Name. 
\v 19 Turne vs againe, O Lord God of hostes: cause thy face to shine and we shalbe saued.

\v 1 To him that excelleth upon Gittith. A Psalme committed to Asaph. Sing ioyfully vnto God our strength: sing loude vnto the God of Iaakob. 
\v 2 Take the song and bring forth the timbrel, the pleasant harpe with the viole. 
\v 3 Blowe the trumpet in the newe moone, euen in the time appointed, at our feast day. 
\v 4 For this is a statute for Israel, and a Law of the God of Iaakob. 
\v 5 Hee set this in Ioseph for a testimonie, when hee came out of the land of Egypt, where I heard a language, that I vnderstoode not. 
\v 6 I haue withdrawen his shoulder from the burden, and his handes haue left the pots. 
\v 7 Thou calledst in affliction and I deliuered thee, and answered thee in the secret of the thunder: I prooued thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah. 
\v 8 Heare, O my people, and I wil protest vnto thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken vnto me, 
\v 9 Let there bee no strange god in thee, neither worship thou any strange god. 
\v 10 For I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide and I will fill it. 
\v 11 But my people would not heare my voyce, and Israel would none of me. 
\v 12 So I gaue them vp vnto the hardnesse of their heart, and they haue walked in their owne cousels. 
\v 13 Oh that my people had hearkened vnto me, and Israel had walked in my wayes. 
\v 14 I would soone haue humbled their enemies, and turned mine hand against their aduersaries. 
\v 15 The haters of the Lord should haue bene subiect vnto him, and their time should haue endured for euer. 
\v 16 And God would haue fedde them with the fatte of wheat, and with honie out of the rocke would I haue sufficed thee.

\v 1 A Psalme committed to Aspah. God standeth in the assemblie of gods: hee iudgeth among gods. 
\v 2 How long wil ye iudge vniustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah. 
\v 3 Doe right to the poore and fatherlesse: doe iustice to the poore and needie. 
\v 4 Deliuer the poore and needie: saue them from the hand of the wicked. 
\v 5 They knowe not and vnderstand nothing: they walke in darkenes, albeit all the foundations of the earth be mooued. 
\v 6 I haue said, Ye are gods, and ye all are children of the most High. 
\v 7 But ye shall die as a man, and yee princes, shall fall like others. 
\v 8 O God, arise, therefore iudge thou the earth: for thou shalt inherite all nations.

\v 1 A song, or Psalme committed to Asaph. Keep not thou silence, O God: bee not still, and cease not, O God. 
\v 2 For lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee, haue lifted vp the head. 
\v 3 They haue taken craftie counsell against thy people, and haue consulted against thy secret ones. 
\v 4 They haue said, Come and let vs cut them off from being a nation: and let the name of Israel be no more in remembrance. 
\v 5 For they haue consulted together in heart, and haue made a league against thee: 
\v 6 The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites, Moab and the Agarims: 
\v 7 Gebal and Ammon, and Amalech, the Philistims with the inhabitants of Tyrus: 
\v 8 Asshur also is ioyned with them: they haue bene an arme to the children of Lot. Selah. 
\v 9 Doe thou to them as vnto the Midianites: as to Sisera and as to Iabin at the riuer of Kishon. 
\v 10 They perished at En-dor, and were dung for the earth. 
\v 11 Make them, euen their princes like Oreb and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes like Zebah and like Zalmuna. 
\v 12 Which haue said, Let vs take for our possession the habitations of God. 
\v 13 O my God, make them like vnto a wheele, and as the stubble before the winde. 
\v 14 As the fire burneth the forest, and as the flame setteth the mountaines on fire: 
\v 15 So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraide with thy storme. 
\v 16 Fill their faces with shame, that they may seeke thy Name, O Lord. 
\v 17 Let them be confounded and troubled for euer: yea, let them be put to shame and perish, 
\v 18 That they may knowe that thou, which art called Iehouah, art alone, euen the most High ouer all the earth.

\v 1 To him that excelleth upon Gittith. A Psalme committed to the sonnes of Korah. O Lord of hostes, howe amiable are thy Tabernacles! 
\v 2 My soule longeth, yea, and fainteth for the courtes of the Lord: for mine heart and my flesh reioyce in the liuing God. 
\v 3 Yea, the sparrowe hath found her an house, and the swallow a nest for her, where she may lay her yong: euen by thine altars, O Lord of hostes, my King and my God. 
\v 4 Blessed are they that dwell in thine house: they will euer praise thee. Selah. 
\v 5 Blessed is the man, whose strength is in thee, and in whose heart are thy wayes. 
\v 6 They going through the vale of Baca, make welles therein: the raine also couereth the pooles. 
\v 7 They goe from strength to strength, till euery one appeare before God in Zion. 
\v 8 O Lord God of hostes, heare my prayer: hearken, O God of Iaakob. Selah. 
\v 9 Beholde, O God, our shielde, and looke vpon the face of thine Anointed. 
\v 10 For a day in thy courtes is better then a thousand other where: I had rather be a doore keeper in the House of my God, then to dwell in the Tabernacles of wickednesse. 
\v 11 For the Lord God is the sunne and shielde vnto vs: the Lord will giue grace and glory, and no good thing will he withhold from them that walke vprightly. 
\v 12 O Lord of hostes, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.

\v 1 To him that excelleth. A Psalme committed to the sonnes of Korah. Lord, thou hast bene fauourable vnto thy land: thou hast brought againe the captiuitie of Iaakob. 
\v 2 Thou hast forgiuen the iniquitie of thy people, and couered all their sinnes. Selah. 
\v 3 Thou hast withdrawen all thine anger, and hast turned backe from the fiercenes of thy wrath. 
\v 4 Turne vs, O God of our saluation, and release thine anger toward vs. 
\v 5 Wilt thou be angry with vs for euer? and wilt thou prolong thy wrath from one generation to another? 
\v 6 Wilt thou not turne againe and quicken vs, that thy people may reioyce in thee? 
\v 7 Shew vs thy mercie, O Lord, and graunt vs thy saluation. 
\v 8 I will hearken what the Lord God will say: for he will speake peace vnto his people, and to his Saintes, that they turne not againe to follie. 
\v 9 Surely his saluation is neere to them that feare him, that glory may dwell in our land. 
\v 10 Mercie and trueth shall meete: righteousnes and peace shall kisse one another. 
\v 11 Trueth shall bud out of the earth, and righteousnes shall looke downe from heauen. 
\v 12 Yea, the Lord shall giue good things, and our land shall giue her increase. 
\v 13 Righteousnesse shall go before him, and shall set her steps in the way.

\v 1 A prayer of David. Incline thine eare, O Lord, and heare me: for I am poore and needy. 
\v 2 Preserue thou my soule, for I am mercifull: my God, saue thou thy seruant, that trusteth in thee. 
\v 3 Be mercifull vnto me, O Lord: for I crie vpon thee continually. 
\v 4 Reioyce the soule of thy seruant: for vnto thee, O Lord, doe I lift vp my soule. 
\v 5 For thou, Lord, art good and mercifull, and of great kindenes vnto all them, that call vpon thee. 
\v 6 Giue eare, Lord, vnto my prayer, and hearken to the voyce of my supplication. 
\v 7 In the day of my trouble I will call vpon thee: for thou hearest me. 
\v 8 Among the gods there is none like thee, O Lord, and there is none that can doe like thy workes. 
\v 9 All nations, whome thou hast made, shall come and worship before thee, O Lord, and shall glorifie thy Name. 
\v 10 For thou art great and doest wonderous things: thou art God alone. 
\v 11 Teach me thy way, O Lord, and I will walke in thy trueth: knit mine heart vnto thee, that I may feare thy Name. 
\v 12 I wil prayse thee, O Lord my God, with all mine heart: yea, I wil glorifie thy Name for euer. 
\v 13 For great is thy mercie toward me, and thou hast deliuered my soule from the lowest graue. 
\v 14 O God, the proude are risen against me, and the assemblies of violent men haue sought my soule, and haue not set thee before them. 
\v 15 But thou, O Lord, art a pitifull God and mercifull, slowe to anger and great in kindenes and trueth. 
\v 16 Turne vnto me, and haue mercy vpon me: giue thy strength vnto thy seruant, and saue the sonne of thine handmayd. 
\v 17 Shew a token of thy goodnes towarde me, that they which hate me, may see it, and be ashamed, because thou, O Lord, hast holpen me and comforted me.

\v 5 And of Zion it shall be sayde, Many are borne in her: and he, euen the most High shall stablish her.

\v 1 A song or Psalme of Heman the Ezrahite to give instruction, committed to the sonnes of Korah for him that excelleth upon Malath Leannoth. O Lord God of my saluation, I cry day and night before thee. 
\v 2 Let my prayer enter into thy presence: incline thine eare vnto my cry. 
\v 3 For my soule is filled with euils, and my life draweth neere to the graue. 
\v 4 I am counted among them that go downe vnto the pit, and am as a man without strength: 
\v 5 Free among the dead, like the slaine lying in the graue, whome thou remembrest no more, and they are cut off from thine hand. 
\v 6 Thou hast layde me in the lowest pit, in darkenes, and in the deepe. 
\v 7 Thine indignation lyeth vpon me, and thou hast vexed me with all thy waues. Selah. 
\v 8 Thou hast put away mine acquaintance farre from me, and made mee to be abhorred of them: I am shut vp, and cannot get foorth. 
\v 9 Mine eye is sorowfull through mine affliction: Lord, I call dayly vpon thee: I stretch out mine hands vnto thee. 
\v 10 Wilt thou shewe a miracle to the dead? or shall the dead rise and prayse thee? Selah. 
\v 11 Shall thy louing kindenes be declared in the graue? or thy faithfulnes in destruction? 
\v 12 Shall thy wonderous workes be knowen in the darke? and thy righteousnes in the land of obliuion? 
\v 13 But vnto thee haue I cryed, O Lord, and early shall my prayer come before thee. 
\v 14 Lord, why doest thou reiect my soule, and hidest thy face from me? 
\v 15 I am afflicted and at the point of death: from my youth I suffer thy terrours, doubting of my life. 
\v 16 Thine indignations goe ouer me, and thy feare hath cut me off. 
\v 17 They came round about me dayly like water, and compassed me together. 
\v 18 My louers and friends hast thou put away from me, and mine acquaintance hid themselues.

\v 1 A Psalme to give instruction, of Ethan the Ezrahite. I will sing the mercies of the Lord for euer: with my mouth will I declare thy trueth from generation to generation. 
\v 2 For I said, Mercie shalbe set vp for euer: thy trueth shalt thou stablish in ye very heauens. 
\v 3 I haue made a couenant with my chosen: I haue sworne to Dauid my seruant, 
\v 4 Thy seede will I stablish for euer, and set vp thy throne from generation to generation. Selah. 
\v 5 O Lord, euen the heauens shall prayse thy wonderous worke: yea, thy trueth in the Congregation of the Saints. 
\v 6 For who is equall to the Lord in the heauen? and who is like the Lord among the sonnes of the gods? 
\v 7 God is very terrible in the assemblie of the Saints, and to be reuerenced aboue all, that are about him. 
\v 8 O Lord God of hostes, who is like vnto thee, which art a mightie Lord, and thy trueth is about thee? 
\v 9 Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waues thereof arise, thou stillest them. 
\v 10 Thou hast beaten downe Rahab as a man slaine: thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy mightie arme. 
\v 11 The heauens are thine, the earth also is thine: thou hast layde the foundation of the world, and all that therein is. 
\v 12 Thou hast created the North and the South: Tabor and Hermon shall reioyce in thy Name. 
\v 13 Thou hast a mightie arme: strong is thine hand, and high is thy right hand. 
\v 14 Righteousnesse and equitie are the stablishment of thy throne: mercy and trueth goe before thy face. 
\v 15 Blessed is the people, that can reioyce in thee: they shall walke in the light of thy countenance, O Lord. 
\v 16 They shall reioyce continually in thy Name, and in thy righteousnes shall they exalt them selues. 
\v 17 For thou art the glory of their strength, and by thy fauour our hornes shall be exalted. 
\v 18 For our shield apperteineth to the Lord, and our King to the holy one of Israel. 
\v 19 Thou spakest then in a vision vnto thine Holy one, and saydest, I haue layde helpe vpon one that is mightie: I haue exalted one chosen out of the people. 
\v 20 I haue found Dauid my seruant: with mine holy oyle haue I anoynted him. 
\v 21 Therefore mine hande shall be established with him, and mine arme shall strengthen him. 
\v 22 The enemie shall not oppresse him, neither shall the wicked hurt him. 
\v 23 But I will destroy his foes before his face, and plague them that hate him. 
\v 24 My trueth also and my mercie shall be with him, and in my Name shall his horne be exalted. 
\v 25 I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the floods. 
\v 26 He shall cry vnto mee, Thou art my Father, my God and the rocke of my saluation. 
\v 27 Also I wil make him my first borne, higher then the Kings of the earth. 
\v 28 My mercie will I keepe for him for euermore, and my couenant shall stande fast with him. 
\v 29 His seede also will I make to endure for euer, and his throne as the dayes of heauen. 
\v 30 But if his children forsake my Lawe, and walke not in my iudgements: 
\v 31 If they breake my statutes, and keepe not my commandements: 
\v 32 Then will I visite their transgression with the rod, and their iniquitie with strokes. 
\v 33 Yet my louing kindnesse will I not take from him, neither will I falsifie my trueth. 
\v 34 My couenant wil I not breake, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips. 
\v 35 I haue sworne once by mine holines, that I will not fayle Dauid, saying, 
\v 36 His seede shall endure for euer, and his throne shalbe as the sunne before me. 
\v 37 He shalbe established for euermore as the moone, and as a faythfull witnes in the heauen. Selah. 
\v 38 But thou hast reiected and abhorred, thou hast bene angry with thine Anoynted. 
\v 39 Thou hast broken the couenant of thy seruant, and profaned his crowne, casting it on the ground. 
\v 40 Thou hast broken downe all his walles: thou hast layd his fortresses in ruine. 
\v 41 All that goe by the way, spoyle him: he is a rebuke vnto his neighbours. 
\v 42 Thou hast set vp the right hand of his enemies, and made all his aduersaries to reioyce. 
\v 43 Thou hast also turned the edge of his sworde, and hast not made him to stand in the battell. 
\v 44 Thou hast caused his dignitie to decay, and cast his throne to the ground. 
\v 45 The dayes of his youth hast thou shortned, and couered him with shame. Selah. 
\v 46 Lord, howe long wilt thou hide thy selfe, for euer? shall thy wrath burne like fire? 
\v 47 Remember of what time I am: wherefore shouldest thou create in vaine all the children of men? 
\v 48 What man liueth, and shall not see death? shall hee deliuer his soule from the hande of the graue? Selah. 
\v 49 Lord, where are thy former mercies, which thou swarest vnto Dauid in thy trueth? 
\v 50 Remember, O Lord, the rebuke of thy seruants, which I beare in my bosome of all the mightie people. 
\v 51 For thine enemies haue reproched thee, O Lord, because they haue reproched the footesteps of thine Anointed. 
\v 52 Praised be the Lord for euermore. So be it, euen so be it.

\v 1 A prayer of Moses, the man of God. Lord, thou hast bene our habitation from generation to generation. 
\v 2 Before the mountaines were made, and before thou hadst formed the earth, and the world, euen from euerlasting to euerlasting thou art our God. 
\v 3 Thou turnest man to destruction: againe thou sayest, Returne, ye sonnes of Adam. 
\v 4 For a thousande yeeres in thy sight are as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night. 
\v 5 Thou hast ouerflowed them: they are as a sleepe: in the morning he groweth like the grasse: 
\v 6 In the morning it florisheth and groweth, but in the euening it is cut downe and withereth. 
\v 7 For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled. 
\v 8 Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, and our secret sinnes in the light of thy countenance. 
\v 9 For all our dayes are past in thine anger: we haue spent our yeeres as a thought. 
\v 10 The time of our life is threescore yeeres and ten, and if they be of strength, fourescore yeeres: yet their strength is but labour and sorowe: for it is cut off quickly, and we flee away. 
\v 11 Who knoweth the power of thy wrath? for according to thy feare is thine anger. 
\v 12 Teach vs so to nomber our dayes, that we may apply our heartes vnto wisdome. 
\v 13 Returne (O Lord, howe long?) and be pacified toward thy seruants. 
\v 14 Fill vs with thy mercie in the morning: so shall we reioyce and be glad all our dayes. 
\v 15 Comfort vs according to the dayes that thou hast afflicted vs, and according to the yeeres that we haue seene euill. 
\v 16 Let thy worke bee seene towarde thy seruants, and thy glory vpon their children. 
\v 17 And let the beautie of the Lord our God be vpon vs, and direct thou the worke of our hands vpon vs, euen direct the worke of our handes. 
\c 91  
\p
\v 1 Who so dwelleth in the secrete of the most High, shall abide in the shadowe of the Almightie. 
\v 2 I will say vnto the Lord, O mine hope, and my fortresse: he is my God, in him will I trust. 
\v 3 Surely he will deliuer thee from the snare of the hunter, and from the noysome pestilence. 
\v 4 Hee will couer thee vnder his winges, and thou shalt be sure vnder his feathers: his trueth shall be thy shielde and buckler. 
\v 5 Thou shalt not be afraide of the feare of the night, nor of the arrowe that flyeth by day: 
\v 6 Nor of the pestilence that walketh in the darkenesse: nor of the plague that destroyeth at noone day. 
\v 7 A thousand shall fall at thy side, and tenne thousand at thy right hand, but it shall not come neere thee. 
\v 8 Doubtlesse with thine eyes shalt thou beholde and see the reward of the wicked. 
\v 9 For thou hast said, The Lord is mine hope: thou hast set the most High for thy refuge. 
\v 10 There shall none euill come vnto thee, neither shall any plague come neere thy tabernacle. 
\v 11 For hee shall giue his Angels charge ouer thee to keepe thee in all thy wayes. 
\v 12 They shall beare thee in their handes, that thou hurt not thy foote against a stone. 
\v 13 Thou shalt walke vpon the lyon and aspe: the yong lyon and the dragon shalt thou treade vnder feete. 
\v 14 Because he hath loued me, therefore will I deliuer him: I will exalt him because hee hath knowen my Name. 
\v 15 He shall call vpon me, and I wil heare him: I will be with him in trouble: I will deliuer him, and glorifie him. 
\v 16 With long life wil I satisfie him, and shew him my saluation.

\v 1 A Psalme or song for the Sabbath day. It is a good thing to praise the Lord, and to sing vnto thy Name, O most High, 
\v 2 To declare thy louing kindenesse in the morning, and thy trueth in the night, 
\v 3 Vpon an instrument of tenne strings, and vpon the viole with the song vpon the harpe. 
\v 4 For thou, Lord, hast made mee glad by thy workes, and I wil reioyce in the workes of thine handes. 
\v 5 O Lord, how glorious are thy workes! and thy thoughtes are very deepe. 
\v 6 An vnwise man knoweth it not, and a foole doeth not vnderstand this, 
\v 7 (When the wicked growe as the grasse, and all the workers of wickednesse doe flourish) that they shall be destroyed for euer. 
\v 8 But thou, O Lord, art most High for euermore. 
\v 9 For loe, thine enemies, O Lord: for loe, thine enemies shall perish: all the workers of iniquitie shall be destroyed. 
\v 10 But thou shalt exalt mine horne, like the vnicornes, and I shalbe anoynted with fresh oyle. 
\v 11 Mine eye also shall see my desire against mine enemies: and mine eares shall heare my wish against the wicked, that rise vp against me. 
\v 12 The righteous shall flourish like a palme tree, and shall grow like a Cedar in Lebanon. 
\v 13 Such as bee planted in the house of the Lord, shall flourish in the courtes of our God. 
\v 14 They shall still bring foorth fruite in their age: they shall be fat and flourishing, 
\v 15 To declare that the Lord my rocke is righteous, and that none iniquitie is in him. 
\c 93  
\p
\v 1 The Lord reigneth, and is clothed with maiestie: the Lord is clothed, and girded with power: the world also shall be established, that it cannot be mooued. 
\v 2 Thy throne is established of olde: thou art from euerlasting. 
\v 3 The floodes haue lifted vp, O Lord: the floodes haue lifted vp their voyce: the floods lift vp their waues. 
\v 4 The waues of ye sea are marueilous through the noyse of many waters, yet the Lord on High is more mightie. 
\v 5 Thy testimonies are very sure: holinesse becommeth thine House, O Lord, for euer.

\v 1 O Lord God the auenger, O God the auenger, shewe thy selfe clearely. 
\v 2 Exalt thy selfe, O Iudge of the worlde, and render a reward to the proude. 
\v 3 Lord how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph? 
\v 4 They prate and speake fiercely: all the workers of iniquitie vaunt themselues. 
\v 5 They smite downe thy people, O Lord, and trouble thine heritage. 
\v 6 They slay the widowe and the stranger, and murder the fatherlesse. 
\v 7 Yet they say, The Lord shall not see: neither will the God of Iaakob regard it. 
\v 8 Vnderstande ye vnwise among the people: and ye fooles, when will ye be wise? 
\v 9 Hee that planted the eare, shall hee not heare? or he that formed the eye, shall he not see? 
\v 10 Or he that chastiseth the nations, shall he not correct? hee that teacheth man knowledge, shall he not knowe? 
\v 11 The Lord knoweth the thoughtes of man, that they are vanitie. 
\v 12 Blessed is the man, whom thou chastisest, O Lord, and teachest him in thy Lawe, 
\v 13 That thou mayest giue him rest from the dayes of euill, whiles the pitte is digged for the wicked. 
\v 14 Surely the Lord will not faile his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance. 
\v 15 For iudgement shall returne to iustice, and all the vpright in heart shall follow after it. 
\v 16 Who will rise vp with me against the wicked? or who will take my part against the workers of iniquitie? 
\v 17 If the Lord had not holpen me, my soule had almost dwelt in silence. 
\v 18 When I said, My foote slideth, thy mercy, O Lord, stayed me. 
\v 19 In the multitude of my thoughts in mine heart, thy comfortes haue reioyced my soule. 
\v 20 Hath the throne of iniquitie fellowship with thee, which forgeth wrong for a Lawe? 
\v 21 They gather them together against the soule of the righteous, and condemne the innocent blood. 
\v 22 But the Lord is my refuge, and my God is the rocke of mine hope. 
\v 23 And hee will recompence them their wickednes, and destroy them in their owne malice: yea, the Lord our God shall destroy them.

\v 1 Come, let vs reioyce vnto the Lord: let vs sing aloude vnto the rocke of our saluation. 
\v 2 Let vs come before his face with praise: let vs sing loude vnto him with Psalmes. 
\v 3 For the Lord is a great God, and a great King aboue all gods. 
\v 4 In whose hande are the deepe places of the earth, and the heightes of the mountaines are his: 
\v 5 To whome the Sea belongeth: for hee made it, and his handes formed the dry land. 
\v 6 Come, let vs worship and fall downe, and kneele before the Lord our maker. 
\v 7 For he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheepe of his hande: to day, if ye will heare his voyce, 
\v 8 Harden not your heart, as in Meribah, and as in the day of Massah in the wildernesse. 
\v 9 Where your fathers tempted me, proued me, though they had seene my worke. 
\v 10 Fourtie yeeres haue I contended with this generation, and said, They are a people that erre in heart, for they haue not knowen my wayes. 
\v 11 Wherefore I sware in my wrath, saying, Surely they shall not enter into my rest.

\v 1 Sing vnto the Lord a newe song: sing vnto the Lord, all the earth. 
\v 2 Sing vnto the Lord, and prayse his Name: declare his saluation from day to day. 
\v 3 Declare his glory among all nations, and his wonders among all people. 
\v 4 For the Lord is great and much to be praysed: he is to be feared aboue all gods. 
\v 5 For all the gods of the people are idoles: but the Lord made the heauens. 
\v 6 Strength and glory are before him: power and beautie are in his Sanctuarie. 
\v 7 Giue vnto the Lord, ye families of the people: giue vnto the Lord glory and power. 
\v 8 Giue vnto the Lord the glory of his Name: bring an offering, and enter into his courtes. 
\v 9 Worship the Lord in the glorious Sanctuarie: tremble before him all the earth. 
\v 10 Say among the nations, The Lord reigneth: surely the world shalbe stable, and not moue, and he shall iudge the people in righteousnesse. 
\v 11 Let the heauens reioyce, and let the earth be glad: let the sea roare, and all that therein is. 
\v 12 Let the field be ioyfull, and all that is in it: let all the trees of the wood then reioyce 
\v 13 Before the Lord: for he commeth, for he cometh to iudge the earth: he wil iudge the world with righteousnes, and the people in his trueth. 
\c 97  
\p
\v 1 The Lord reigneth: let the earth reioyce: let the multitude of the yles be glad. 
\v 2 Cloudes and darkenes are round about him: righteousnesse and iudgement are the foundation of his throne. 
\v 3 There shall goe a fire before him, and burne vp his enemies round about. 
\v 4 His lightnings gaue light vnto the worlde: the earth sawe it and was afraide. 
\v 5 The mountaines melted like waxe at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth. 
\v 6 The heauens declare his righteousnes, and all the people see his glory. 
\v 7 Confounded be all they that serue grauen images, and that glory in idoles: worship him all ye gods. 
\v 8 Zion heard of it, and was glad: and the daughters of Iudah reioyced, because of thy iudgements, O Lord. 
\v 9 For thou, Lord, art most High aboue all the earth: thou art much exalted aboue all gods. 
\v 10 Ye that loue the Lord, hate euill: he preserueth the soules of his Saints: hee will deliuer them from the hand of the wicked. 
\v 11 Light is sowen for the righteous, and ioy for the vpright in heart. 
\v 12 Reioyce ye righteous in the Lord, and giue thankes for his holy remembrance. 
\c 98  
\p
\v 1 A Psalme. Sing vnto the Lord a newe song: for hee hath done marueilous things: his right hand, and his holy arme haue gotten him the victorie. 
\v 2 The Lord declared his saluation: his righteousnes hath he reueiled in the sight of ye nations. 
\v 3 He hath remembred his mercy and his trueth toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth haue seene the saluation of our God. 
\v 4 All the earth, sing ye loude vnto the Lord: crie out and reioyce, and sing prayses. 
\v 5 Sing prayse to the Lord vpon the harpe, euen vpon the harpe with a singing voyce. 
\v 6 With shalmes and sound of trumpets sing loude before the Lord the King. 
\v 7 Let the sea roare, and all that therein is, the world, and they that dwell therein. 
\v 8 Let the floods clap their hands, and let the mountaines reioyce together 
\v 9 Before the Lord: for he is come to iudge the earth: with righteousnesse shall hee iudge the world, and the people with equitie.

\v 1 The Lord reigneth, let the people tremble: he sitteth betweene the Cherubims, let the earth be moued.

\v 3 They shall prayse thy great and fearefull Name (for it is holy) 
\v 4 And the Kings power, that loueth iudgement: for thou hast prepared equitie: thou hast executed iudgement and iustice in Iaakob. 
\v 5 Exalt the Lord our God, and fall downe before his footestoole: for he is holy. 
\v 6 Moses and Aaron were among his Priests, and Samuel among such as call vpon his Name: these called vpon the Lord, and he heard them. 
\v 7 Hee spake vnto them in the cloudie pillar: they kept his testimonies, and the Lawe that he gaue them. 
\v 8 Thou heardest them, O Lord our God: thou wast a fauourable God vnto them, though thou didst take vengeance for their inuentions. 
\v 9 Exalt the Lord our God, and fall downe before his holy Mountaine: for the Lord our God is holy.

\v 1 A Psalme of David. I will sing mercie and iudgement: vnto thee, O Lord, will I sing. 
\v 2 I will doe wisely in the perfite way, till thou commest to me: I will walke in the vprightnes of mine heart in the middes of mine house. 
\v 3 I wil set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the worke of them that fall away: it shall not cleaue vnto me. 
\v 4 A froward heart shall depart from me: I will knowe none euill. 
\v 5 Him that priuily slandereth his neighbour, wil I destroy: him that hath a proude looke and hie heart, I cannot suffer. 
\v 6 Mine eyes shalbe vnto the faithfull of the lande, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfite way, he shall serue me. 
\v 7 There shall no deceitful person dwell within mine house: he that telleth lyes, shall not remaine in my sight. 
\v 8 Betimes will I destroy all the wicked of the land, that I may cut off all the workers of iniquitie from the Citie of the Lord.

\v 1 A prayer of the afflicted, when he shall be in distresse, and pour forth his meditation before the Lord. O Lord, heare my prayer, and let my crye come vnto thee. 
\v 2 Hide not thy face from me in the time of my trouble: incline thine eares vnto me: when I call, make haste to heare me. 
\v 3 For my dayes are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burnt like an herthe. 
\v 4 Mine heart is smitten and withereth like grasse, because I forgate to eate my bread. 
\v 5 For the voyce of my groning my bones doe cleaue to my skinne. 
\v 6 I am like a pelicane of the wildernesse: I am like an owle of the deserts. 
\v 7 I watch and am as a sparrowe alone vpon the house top. 
\v 8 Mine enemies reuile me dayly, and they that rage against me, haue sworne against me. 
\v 9 Surely I haue eaten asshes as bread, and mingled my drinke with weeping, 
\v 10 Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast heaued me vp, and cast me downe. 
\v 11 My dayes are like a shadowe that fadeth, and I am withered like grasse. 
\v 12 But thou, O Lord, doest remaine for euer, and thy remembrance from generation to generation. 
\v 13 Thou wilt arise and haue mercy vpon Zion: for the time to haue mercie thereon, for the appointed time is come. 
\v 14 For thy seruants delite in the stones thereof, and haue pitie on the dust thereof. 
\v 15 Then the heathen shall feare the Name of the Lord, and all the Kings of the earth thy glory, 
\v 16 When the Lord shall build vp Zion, and shall appeare in his glory, 
\v 17 And shall turne vnto the prayer of the desolate, and not despise their prayer. 
\v 18 This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people, which shalbe created, shall prayse the Lord. 
\v 19 For he hath looked downe from the height of his Sanctuarie: out of the heauen did the Lord beholde the earth, 
\v 20 That he might heare the mourning of the prisoner, and deliuer the children of death: 
\v 21 That they may declare the Name of the Lord in Zion, and his prayse in Ierusalem, 
\v 22 When the people shalbe gathered together, and the kingdomes to serue the Lord. 
\v 23 He abated my strength in the way, and shortened my dayes. 
\v 24 And I sayd, O my God, take me not away in the middes of my dayes: thy yeeres endure from generation to generation. 
\v 25 Thou hast aforetime layde the foundation of the earth, and the heauens are the worke of thine hands. 
\v 26 They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: euen they all shall waxe olde as doeth a garment: as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed. 
\v 27 But thou art the same, and thy yeeres shall not fayle. 
\v 28 The children of thy seruants shall continue, and their seede shall stand fast in thy sight. 
\c 103  
\p
\v 1 A Psalme of David. My soule, prayse thou the Lord, and all that is within me, prayse his holy Name. 
\v 2 My soule, prayse thou the Lord, and forget not all his benefites. 
\v 3 Which forgiueth all thine iniquitie, and healeth all thine infirmities. 
\v 4 Which redeemeth thy life from the graue, and crowneth thee with mercy and compassions. 
\v 5 Which satisfieth thy mouth with good things: and thy youth is renued like the eagles. 
\v 6 The Lord executeth righteousnes and iudgement to all that are oppressed. 
\v 7 He made his wayes knowen vnto Moses, and his workes vnto the children of Israel. 
\v 8 The Lord is full of compassion and mercie, slowe to anger and of great kindnesse. 
\v 9 He will not alway chide, neither keepe his anger for euer. 
\v 10 He hath not dealt with vs after our sinnes, nor rewarded vs according to our iniquities. 
\v 11 For as high as the heauen is aboue ye earth, so great is his mercie toward them that feare him. 
\v 12 As farre as the East is from the West: so farre hath he remooued our sinnes from vs. 
\v 13 As a father hath compassion on his children, so hath the Lord compassion on them that feare him. 
\v 14 For he knoweth whereof we be made: he remembreth that we are but dust. 
\v 15 The dayes of man are as grasse: as a flowre of the fielde, so florisheth he. 
\v 16 For the winde goeth ouer it, and it is gone, and the place thereof shall knowe it no more. 
\v 17 But the louing kindnesse of the Lord endureth for euer and euer vpon them that feare him, and his righteousnes vpon childrens children, 
\v 18 Vnto them that keepe his couenant, and thinke vpon his commandements to doe them. 
\v 19 The Lord hath prepared his throne in heauen, and his Kingdome ruleth ouer all. 
\v 20 Prayse the Lord, ye his Angels, that excell in strength, that doe his commandement in obeying the voyce of his worde. 
\v 21 Prayse the Lord, all ye his hostes, ye his seruants that doe his pleasure. 
\v 22 Prayse the Lord, all ye his workes, in all places of his dominion: my soule, prayse thou the Lord. 
\c 104  
\p
\v 1 My soule, prayse thou the Lord: O Lord my God, thou art exceeding great, thou art clothed with glorie and honour. 
\v 2 Which couereth himselfe with light as with a garment, and spreadeth the heauens like a curtaine. 
\v 3 Which layeth the beames of his chambers in the waters, and maketh the cloudes his chariot, and walketh vpon the wings of the winde. 
\v 4 Which maketh his spirits his messengers, and a flaming fire his ministers. 
\v 5 He set the earth vpon her foundations, so that it shall neuer moue. 
\v 6 Thou coueredst it with the deepe as with a garment: the waters woulde stand aboue the mountaines. 
\v 7 But at thy rebuke they flee: at the voyce of thy thunder they haste away. 
\v 8 And the mountaines ascend, and the valleis descend to the place which thou hast established for them. 
\v 9 But thou hast set them a bounde, which they shall not passe: they shall not returne to couer the earth. 
\v 10 He sendeth the springs into the valleis, which runne betweene the mountaines. 
\v 11 They shall giue drinke to all the beasts of the fielde, and the wilde asses shall quench their thirst. 
\v 12 By these springs shall the foules of the heauen dwell, and sing among the branches. 
\v 13 He watereth the mountaines from his chambers, and the earth is filled with the fruite of thy workes. 
\v 14 He causeth grasse to growe for the cattell, and herbe for the vse of man, that he may bring forth bread out of the earth, 
\v 15 And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oyle to make the face to shine, and bread that strengtheneth mans heart. 
\v 16 The high trees are satisfied, euen the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted, 
\v 17 That ye birdes may make their nestes there: the storke dwelleth in the firre trees. 
\v 18 The high mountaines are for the goates: the rockes are a refuge for the conies. 
\v 19 He appoynted the moone for certaine seasons: the sunne knoweth his going downe. 
\v 20 Thou makest darkenesse, and it is night, wherein all the beastes of the forest creepe forth. 
\v 21 The lions roare after their praye, and seeke their meate at God. 
\v 22 When the sunne riseth, they retire, and couche in their dennes. 
\v 23 Then goeth man forth to his worke, and to his labour vntill the euening. 
\v 24 O Lord, howe manifolde are thy workes! in wisdome hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches. 
\v 25 So is this sea great and wide: for therein are things creeping innumerable, both small beastes and great. 
\v 26 There goe the shippes, yea, that Liuiathan, whom thou hast made to play therein. 
\v 27 All these waite vpon thee, that thou maiest giue them foode in due season. 
\v 28 Thou giuest it to them, and they gather it: thou openest thine hand, and they are filled with good things. 
\v 29 But if thou hide thy face, they are troubled: if thou take away their breath, they dye and returne to their dust. 
\v 30 Againe if thou send forth thy spirit, they are created, and thou renuest the face of the earth. 
\v 31 Glory be to the Lord for euer: let the Lord reioyce in his workes. 
\v 32 He looketh on the earth and it trembleth: he toucheth the mountaines, and they smoke. 
\v 33 I will sing vnto the Lord all my life: I will prayse my God, while I liue. 
\v 34 Let my wordes be acceptable vnto him: I will reioyce in the Lord. 
\v 35 Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and the wicked till there be no more: O my soule, prayse thou the Lord. Prayse ye the Lord. 
\c 105  
\p
\v 1 Praise the Lord, and call vpon his Name: declare his workes among the people. 
\v 2 Sing vnto him, sing prayse vnto him, and talke of all his wonderous workes. 
\v 3 Reioyce in his holy Name: let the heart of them that seeke the Lord, reioyce. 
\v 4 Seeke the Lord and his strength: seeke his face continually. 
\v 5 Remember his marueilous woorkes, that he hath done, his wonders and the iudgements of his mouth, 
\v 6 Ye seede of Abraham his seruant, ye children of Iaakob, which are his elect. 
\v 7 He is the Lord our God: his iudgements are through all the earth. 
\v 8 He hath alway remembred his couenant and promise, that he made to a thousand generations, 
\v 9 Euen that which he made with Abraham, and his othe vnto Izhak: 
\v 10 And since hath confirmed it to Iaakob for a lawe, and to Israel for an euerlasting couenant, 
\v 11 Saying, Vnto thee will I giue the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance. 
\v 12 Albeit they were fewe in nomber, yea, very fewe, and strangers in the land, 
\v 13 And walked about from nation to nation, from one kingdome to another people, 
\v 14 Yet suffered he no man to doe them wrong, but reprooued Kings for their sakes, saying, 
\v 15 Touche not mine anointed, and doe my Prophets no harme. 
\v 16 Moreouer, he called a famine vpon ye land, and vtterly brake the staffe of bread. 
\v 17 But he sent a man before them: Ioseph was solde for a slaue. 
\v 18 They helde his feete in the stockes, and he was laide in yrons, 
\v 19 Vntill his appointed time came, and the counsell of the Lord had tryed him. 
\v 20 The King sent and loosed him: euen the Ruler of the people deliuered him. 
\v 21 He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance, 
\v 22 That he shoulde binde his princes vnto his will, and teach his Ancients wisedome. 
\v 23 Then Israel came to Egypt, and Iaakob was a stranger in the land of Ham. 
\v 24 And he increased his people exceedingly, and made them stronger then their oppressours. 
\v 25 He turned their heart to hate his people, and to deale craftily with his seruants. 
\v 26 Then sent he Moses his seruant, and Aaron whom he had chosen. 
\v 27 They shewed among them the message of his signes, and wonders in the land of Ham. 
\v 28 He sent darkenesse, and made it darke: and they were not disobedient vnto his commission. 
\v 29 He turned their waters into blood, and slewe their fish. 
\v 30 Their land brought foorth frogs, euen in their Kings chambers. 
\v 31 He spake, and there came swarmes of flies and lice in all their quarters. 
\v 32 He gaue them haile for raine, and flames of fire in their land. 
\v 33 He smote their vines also and their figge trees, and brake downe the trees in their coastes. 
\v 34 He spake, and the grashoppers came, and caterpillers innumerable, 
\v 35 And did eate vp all the grasse in their land, and deuoured the fruite of their ground. 
\v 36 He smote also all the first borne in their land, euen the beginning of all their strength. 
\v 37 He brought them forth also with siluer and golde, and there was none feeble among their tribes. 
\v 38 Egypt was glad at their departing: for the feare of them had fallen vpon them. 
\v 39 He spred a cloude to be a couering, and fire to giue light in the night. 
\v 40 They asked, and he brought quailes, and he filled them with the bread of heauen. 
\v 41 He opened the rocke, and the waters flowed out, and ranne in the drye places like a riuer. 
\v 42 For he remembred his holy promise to Abraham his seruant, 
\v 43 And he brought forth his people with ioy, and his chosen with gladnesse, 
\v 44 And gaue them the lands of the heathen, and they tooke the labours of the people in possession, 
\v 45 That they might keepe his statutes, and obserue his Lawes. Prayse ye the Lord. 
\c 106  
\p
\v 1 Praise ye the Lord. Praise ye the Lord because he is good, for his mercie endureth for euer. 
\v 2 Who can expresse the noble actes of the Lord, or shewe forth all his prayse? 
\v 3 Blessed are they that keepe iudgement, and doe righteousnesse at all times. 
\v 4 Remember me, O Lord, with the fauour of thy people: visite me with thy saluation, 
\v 5 That I may see the felicitie of thy chosen, and reioyce in the ioy of thy people, and glorie with thine inheritance. 
\v 6 We haue sinned with our fathers: we haue committed iniquitie, and done wickedly. 
\v 7 Our fathers vnderstoode not thy wonders in Egypt, neither remembred they the multitude of thy mercies, but rebelled at the Sea, euen at the red sea. 
\v 8 Neuerthelesse he saued them for his Names sake, that he might make his power to be knowen. 
\v 9 And he rebuked the red Sea, and it was dryed vp, and he led them in the deepe, as in the wildernesse. 
\v 10 And he saued them from ye aduersaries hand, and deliuered them from ye hand of the enemie. 
\v 11 And the waters couered their oppressours: not one of them was left. 
\v 12 Then beleeued they his wordes, and sang prayse vnto him. 
\v 13 But incontinently they forgate his workes: they wayted not for his counsell, 
\v 14 But lusted with concupiscence in the wildernes, and tempted God in the desert. 
\v 15 Then he gaue them their desire: but he sent leannesse into their soule. 
\v 16 They enuied Moses also in the tentes, and Aaron the holy one of the Lord. 
\v 17 Therefore the earth opened and swallowed vp Dathan, and couered the companie of Abiram. 
\v 18 And the fire was kindled in their assembly: the flame burnt vp the wicked. 
\v 19 They made a calfe in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image. 
\v 20 Thus they turned their glory into the similitude of a bullocke, that eateth grasse. 
\v 21 They forgate God their Sauiour, which had done great things in Egypt, 
\v 22 Wonderous woorkes in the lande of Ham, and fearefull things by the red Sea. 
\v 23 Therefore he minded to destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stand in the breach before him to turne away his wrath, least he shoulde destroy them. 
\v 24 Also they contemned that pleasant land, and beleeued not his worde, 
\v 25 But murmured in their tentes, and hearkened not vnto the voice of the Lord. 
\v 26 Therefore hee lifted vp his hande against them, to destroy them in the wildernesse, 
\v 27 And to destroy their seede among the nations, and to scatter them throughout the countries. 
\v 28 They ioyned themselues also vnto Baalpeor, and did eate the offrings of the dead. 
\v 29 Thus they prouoked him vnto anger with their owne inuentions, and the plague brake in vpon them. 
\v 30 But Phinehas stoode vp, and executed iudgement, and the plague was staied. 
\v 31 And it was imputed vnto him for righteousnes from generation to generation for euer. 
\v 32 They angred him also at the waters of Meribah, so that Moses was punished for their sakes, 
\v 33 Because they vexed his spirite, so that hee spake vnaduisedly with his lippes. 
\v 34 Neither destroied they the people, as the Lord had commanded them, 
\v 35 But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their workes, 
\v 36 And serued their idoles, which were their ruine. 
\v 37 Yea, they offered their sonnes, and their daughters vnto deuils, 
\v 38 And shed innocent blood, euen the blood of their sonnes, and of their daughters, whome they offred vnto the idoles of Canaan, and the lande was defiled with blood. 
\v 39 Thus were they steined with their owne woorkes, and went a whoring with their owne inuentions. 
\v 40 Therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled against his people, and he abhorred his owne inheritance. 
\v 41 And hee gaue them into the hande of the heathen: and they that hated them, were lordes ouer them. 
\v 42 Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were humbled vnder their hand. 
\v 43 Many a time did hee deliuer them, but they prouoked him by their counsels: therefore they were brought downe by their iniquitie. 
\v 44 Yet hee sawe when they were in affliction, and he heard their crie. 
\v 45 And he remembred his couenant towarde them and repented according to the multitude of his mercies, 
\v 46 And gaue them fauour in the sight of all them that lead them captiues. 
\v 47 Saue vs, O Lord our God, and gather vs from among the heathen, that we may praise thine holy Name, and glorie in thy praise. 
\v 48 Blessed be the Lord God of Israel for euer and euer, and let all the people say, So be it. Praise yee the Lord. 
\c 107  
\p
\v 1 Praise the Lord, because he is good: for his mercie endureth for euer. 
\v 2 Let them, which haue bene redeemed of the Lord, shewe how he hath deliuered them from the hand of the oppressour, 
\v 3 And gathered them out of the lands, from the East and from the West, from the North and from the South. 
\v 4 When they wandered in the desert and wildernesse out of the waie, and founde no citie to dwell in, 
\v 5 Both hungrie and thirstie, their soule fainted in them. 
\v 6 Then they cried vnto the Lord in their trouble, and he deliuered them from their distresse, 
\v 7 And led them forth by the right way, that they might goe to a citie of habitation. 
\v 8 Let them therefore confesse before ye Lord his louing kindnesse, and his wonderfull woorkes before the sonnes of men. 
\v 9 For he satisfied the thirstie soule, and filled the hungrie soule with goodnesse. 
\v 10 They that dwell in darkenesse and in the shadowe of death, being bounde in miserie and yron, 
\v 11 Because they rebelled against the wordes of the Lord, and despised the counsell of the most High, 
\v 12 When he humbled their heart with heauines, then they fell downe and there was no helper. 
\v 13 Then they cried vnto the Lord in their trouble, and he deliuered them from their distresse. 
\v 14 He brought them out of darkenes, and out of the shadowe of death, and brake their bandes asunder. 
\v 15 Let them therefore cofesse before the Lord his louing kindnesse, and his wonderfull woorkes before the sonnes of men. 
\v 16 For hee hath broken the gates of brasse, and brast the barres of yron asunder. 
\v 17 Fooles by reason of their transgression, and because of their iniquities are afflicted. 
\v 18 Their soule abhorreth al meat, and they are brought to deaths doore. 
\v 19 Then they crie vnto the Lord in their trouble, and he deliuereth them from their distresse. 
\v 20 He sendeth his worde and healeth them, and deliuereth them from their graues. 
\v 21 Let them therefore cofesse before the Lord his louing kindnesse, and his wonderful workes before the sonnes of men, 
\v 22 And let them offer sacrifices of praise, and declare his workes with reioycing. 
\v 23 They that goe downe to the sea in ships, and occupie by the great waters, 
\v 24 They see the woorkes of the Lord, and his wonders in the deepe. 
\v 25 For he commaundeth and raiseth the stormie winde, and it lifteth vp the waues thereof. 
\v 26 They mount vp to the heauen, and descend to ye deepe, so that their soule melteth for trouble. 
\v 27 They are tossed to and from, and stagger like a drunken man, and all their cunning is gone. 
\v 28 Then they crie vnto the Lord in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresse. 
\v 29 He turneth the storme to calme, so that the waues thereof are still. 
\v 30 When they are quieted, they are glad, and hee bringeth them vnto the hauen, where they would be. 
\v 31 Let them therfore confesse before the Lord his louing kindnesse, and his wonderfull woorkes before the sonnes of men. 
\v 32 And let them exalt him in the Congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the Elders. 
\v 33 He turneth the floodes into a wildernesse, and the springs of waters into drinesse, 
\v 34 And a fruitfull land into barrennes for the wickednes of them that dwell therein. 
\v 35 Againe hee turneth the wildernesse into pooles of water, and the drie lande into water springs. 
\v 36 And there he placeth the hungrie, and they builde a citie to dwell in, 
\v 37 And sowe the fieldes, and plant vineyardes, which bring foorth fruitfull increase. 
\v 38 For he blesseth them, and they multiplie exceedingly, and he diminisheth not their cattell. 
\v 39 Againe men are diminished, and brought lowe by oppression, euill and sorowe. 
\v 40 He powreth contempt vpon princes, and causeth them to erre in desert places out of the way. 
\v 41 Yet he raiseth vp the poore out of miserie, and maketh him families like a flocke of sheepe. 
\v 42 The righteous shall see it, and reioyce, and all iniquitie shall stoppe her mouth. 
\v 43 Who is wise that hee may obserue these things? for they shall vnderstand the louing kindnesse of the Lord.

\v 1 A song or Psalme of David. O God, mine heart is prepared, so is my tongue: I will sing and giue praise. 
\v 2 Awake viole and harpe: I will awake early. 
\v 3 I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people, and I wil sing vnto thee among the nations. 
\v 4 For thy mercy is great aboue the heauens, and thy trueth vnto the clouds. 
\v 5 Exalt thy self, O God, aboue the heauens, and let thy glorie be vpon all the earth, 
\v 6 That thy beloued may be deliuered: helpe with thy right hand and heare me. 
\v 7 God hath spoken in his holinesse: therefore I will reioyce, I shall deuide Shechem and measure the valley of Succoth. 
\v 8 Gilead shalbe mine, and Manasseh shalbe mine: Ephraim also shalbe the strength of mine head: Iuda is my lawgiuer. 
\v 9 Moab shalbe my washpot: ouer Edom wil I cast out my shoe: vpon Palestina wil I triumph. 
\v 10 Who will leade mee into the strong citie? who will bring me vnto Edom? 
\v 11 Wilt not thou, O God, which haddest forsaken vs, and diddest not goe foorth, O God, with our armies? 
\v 12 Giue vs helpe against trouble: for vaine is the helpe of man. 
\v 13 Through God we shall doe valiantly: for he shall treade downe our enemies.

\p
\v 1 To him that excelleth. A Psalme of David. Holde not thy tongue, O God of my praise. 
\v 2 For the mouth of the wicked, and the mouth full of deceite are opened vpon me: they haue spoken to me with a lying tongue. 
\v 3 They compassed me about also with words of hatred, and fought against me without a cause. 
\v 4 For my friendship they were mine aduersaries, but I gaue my selfe to praier. 
\v 5 And they haue rewarded me euil for good, and hatred for my friendship. 
\v 6 Set thou the wicked ouer him, and let the aduersarie stand at his right hand. 
\v 7 Whe he shalbe iudged, let him be condemned, and let his praier be turned into sinne. 
\v 8 Let his daies be fewe, and let another take his charge. 
\v 9 Let his children be fatherlesse, and his wife a widowe. 
\v 10 Let his children be vagabonds and beg and seeke bread, comming out of their places destroyed. 
\v 11 Let the extortioner catch al that he hath, and let the strangers spoile his labour. 
\v 12 Let there be none to extend mercie vnto him: neither let there be any to shewe mercie vpon his fatherlesse children. 
\v 13 Let his posteritie be destroied, and in the generation following let their name be put out. 
\v 14 Let the iniquitie of his fathers bee had in remembrance with the Lord: and let not the sinne of his mother be done away. 
\v 15 But let them alway be before the Lord, that he may cut off their memorial from ye earth. 
\v 16 Because he remembred not to shew mercie, but persecuted the afflicted and poore man, and the sorowfull hearted to slay him. 
\v 17 As he loued cursing, so shall it come vnto him, and as he loued not blessing, so shall it be farre from him. 
\v 18 As he clothed himselfe with cursing like a rayment, so shall it come into his bowels like water, and like oyle into his bones. 
\v 19 Let it be vnto him as a garment to couer him, and for a girdle, wherewith he shalbe alway girded. 
\v 20 Let this be the rewarde of mine aduersarie from the Lord, and of them, that speake euill against my soule. 
\v 21 But thou, O Lord my God, deale with me according vnto thy Name: deliuer me, (for thy mercie is good) 
\v 22 Because I am poore and needie, and mine heart is wounded within me. 
\v 23 I depart like the shadowe that declineth, and am shaken off as the grashopper. 
\v 24 My knees are weake through fasting, and my flesh hath lost all fatnes. 
\v 25 I became also a rebuke vnto them: they that looked vpon me, shaked their heads. 
\v 26 Helpe me, O Lord my God: saue me according to thy mercie. 
\v 27 And they shall know, that this is thine hand, and that thou, Lord, hast done it. 
\v 28 Though they curse, yet thou wilt blesse: they shall arise and be confounded, but thy seruant shall reioyce. 
\v 29 Let mine aduersaries be clothed with shame, and let them couer themselues with their confusion, as with a cloke. 
\v 30 I will giue thankes vnto the Lord greatly with my mouth and praise him among ye multitude.

\v 3 Thy people shall come willingly at the time of assembling thine armie in holy beautie: the youth of thy wombe shalbe as the morning dewe. 
\v 4 The Lord sware and wil not repent, Thou art a Priest for euer after ye order of Melchi-zedek. 
\v 5 The Lord, that is at thy right hand, shall wound Kings in the day of his wrath.

\v 1 Praise ye the Lord. I will prayse the Lord with my whole heart in the assemblie and Congregation of the iust.

\v 4 He hath made his wonderfull workes to be had in remembrance: the Lord is mercifull and full of compassion. 
\v 5 He hath giuen a portion vnto them that feare him: he wil euer be mindfull of his couenant. 
\v 6 He hath shewed to his people the power of his workes in giuing vnto them the heritage of the heathen. 
\v 7 The workes of his handes are trueth and iudgement: all his statutes are true. 
\v 8 They are stablished for euer and euer, and are done in trueth and equitie. 
\v 9 He sent redemption vnto his people: he hath commanded his couenant for euer: holy and fearefull is his Name.

\v 4 Vnto the righteous ariseth light in darkenes: he is merciful and full of copassion and righteous. 
\v 5 A good man is mercifull and lendeth, and will measure his affaires by iudgement. 
\v 6 Surely he shall neuer be moued: but the righteous shalbe had in euerlasting remembrance. 
\v 7 He will not be afraide of euill tidings: for his heart is fixed, and beleeueth in the Lord. 
\v 8 His heart is stablished: therefore he will not feare, vntill he see his desire vpon his enemies. 
\v 9 He hath distributed and giuen to ye poore: his righteousnesse remaineth for euer: his horne shalbe exalted with glory. 
\v 10 The wicked shall see it and be angrie: he shall gnash with his teeth, and consume away: the desire of the wicked shall perish.

\v 5 The Lord is mercifull and righteous, and our God is full of compassion. 
\v 6 The Lord preserueth the simple: I was in miserie and he saued me. 
\v 7 Returne vnto thy rest, O my soule: for the Lord hath bene beneficiall vnto thee, 
\v 8 Because thou hast deliuered my soule from death, mine eyes from teares, and my feete from falling. 
\v 9 I shall walke before the Lord in the lande of the liuing. 
\v 10 I beleeued, therefore did I speake: for I was sore troubled. 
\v 11 I said in my feare, All men are lyers. 
\v 12 What shall I render vnto the Lord for all his benefites toward me? 
\v 13 I will take the cup of saluation, and call vpon the Name of the Lord. 
\v 14 I will pay my vowes vnto the Lord, euen nowe in the presence of all his people. 
\v 15 Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saintes. 
\v 16 Beholde, Lord: for I am thy seruant, I am thy seruant, and the sonne of thine handmaide: thou hast broken my bondes.

\v 16 The right hand of the Lord is exalted: the right hand of the Lord hath done valiantly. 
\v 17 I shall not die, but liue, and declare the woorkes of the Lord.

\v 2 Blessed are they that keepe his testimonies, and seeke him with their whole heart. 
\v 3 Surely they woorke none iniquitie, but walke in his waies. 
\v 4 Thou hast commanded to keepe thy precepts diligently. 
\v 5 Oh that my waies were directed to keepe thy statutes! 
\v 6 Then should I not be confounded, when I haue respect vnto all thy commandements. 
\v 7 I will praise thee with an vpright heart, when I shall learne the iudgements of thy righteousnesse. 
\v 8 I will keepe thy statutes: forsake mee not ouerlong. 
\v 9 BETH. Wherewith shall a yong man redresse his waie? in taking heede thereto according to thy woorde. 
\v 10 With my whole heart haue I sought thee: let me not wander from thy commandements. 
\v 11 I haue hid thy promise in mine heart, that I might not sinne against thee. 
\v 12 Blessed art thou, O Lord: teache mee thy statutes. 
\v 13 With my lippes haue I declared all the iudgements of thy mouth. 
\v 14 I haue had as great delight in the way of thy testimonies, as in all riches. 
\v 15 I will meditate in thy precepts, and consider thy waies. 
\v 16 I will delite in thy statutes, and I will not forget thy worde. 
\v 17 GIMEL. Be beneficiall vnto thy seruant, that I may liue and keepe thy woorde. 
\v 18 Open mine eies, that I may see the wonders of thy Lawe. 
\v 19 I am a stranger vpon earth: hide not thy commandements from me. 
\v 20 Mine heart breaketh for the desire to thy iudgements alway. 
\v 21 Thou hast destroied the proud: cursed are they that doe erre from thy commandements. 
\v 22 Remoue from mee shame and contempt: for I haue kept thy testimonies. 
\v 23 Princes also did sit, and speake against me: but thy seruant did meditate in thy statutes. 
\v 24 Also thy testimonies are my delite, and my counsellers. 
\v 25 DALETH. My soule cleaueth to the dust: quicken me according to thy worde. 
\v 26 I haue declared my waies, and thou heardest me: teache me thy statutes. 
\v 27 Make me to vnderstand ye way of thy precepts, and I will meditate in thy wondrous workes. 
\v 28 My soule melteth for heauinesse: raise mee vp according vnto thy worde. 
\v 29 Take from mee the way of lying, and graunt me graciously thy Lawe. 
\v 30 I haue chosen the way of trueth, and thy iudgements haue I laied before me. 
\v 31 I haue cleaued to thy testimonies, O Lord: confound me not. 
\v 32 I will runne the way of thy commandements, when thou shalt enlarge mine heart. 
\v 33 HE. Teach mee, O Lord, the way of thy statutes, and I will keepe it vnto the ende. 
\v 34 Giue mee vnderstanding, and I will keepe thy Law: yea, I wil keepe it with my whole heart. 
\v 35 Direct mee in the path of thy commandements: for therein is my delite. 
\v 36 Incline mine heart vnto thy testimonies, and not to couetousnesse. 
\v 37 Turne away mine eies from regarding vanitie, and quicken me in thy way. 
\v 38 Stablish thy promise to thy seruaunt, because he feareth thee. 
\v 39 Take away my rebuke that I feare: for thy iudgements are good. 
\v 40 Beholde, I desire thy commandements: quicken me in thy righteousnesse, 
\v 41 VAV. And let thy louing kindnesse come vnto me, O Lord, and thy saluation according to thy promise. 
\v 42 So shall I make answere vnto my blasphemers: for I trust in thy woorde. 
\v 43 And take not the woorde of trueth vtterly out of my mouth: for I waite for thy iudgements. 
\v 44 So shall I alway keepe thy Lawe for euer and euer. 
\v 45 And I will walke at libertie: for I seeke thy precepts. 
\v 46 I will speake also of thy testimonies before Kings, and will not be ashamed. 
\v 47 And my delite shalbe in thy commandements, which I haue loued. 
\v 48 Mine handes also will I lift vp vnto thy commandements, which I haue loued, and I will meditate in thy statutes. 
\v 49 ZAIN. Remember the promise made to thy seruant, wherein thou hast caused me to trust. 
\v 50 It is my comfort in my trouble: for thy promise hath quickened me. 
\v 51 The proude haue had me exceedingly in derision: yet haue I not declined from thy Lawe. 
\v 52 I remembred thy iudgements of olde, O Lord, and haue bene comforted. 
\v 53 Feare is come vpon mee for the wicked, that forsake thy Lawe. 
\v 54 Thy statutes haue beene my songes in the house of my pilgrimage. 
\v 55 I haue remembred thy Name, O Lord, in the night, and haue kept thy Lawe. 
\v 56 This I had because I kept thy precepts. 
\v 57 CHETH. O Lord, that art my portion, I haue determined to keepe thy wordes. 
\v 58 I made my supplication in thy presence with my whole heart: be mercifull vnto me according to thy promise. 
\v 59 I haue considered my waies, and turned my feete into thy testimonies. 
\v 60 I made haste and delaied not to keepe thy commandements. 
\v 61 The bandes of the wicked haue robbed me: but I haue not forgotten thy Lawe. 
\v 62 At midnight will I rise to giue thanks vnto thee, because of thy righteous iudgements. 
\v 63 I am companion of all them that feare thee, and keepe thy precepts. 
\v 64 The earth, O Lord, is full of thy mercie: teache me thy statutes. 
\v 65 TETH. O Lord, thou hast delt graciously with thy seruant according vnto thy woorde. 
\v 66 Teach me good iudgement and knowledge: for I haue beleeued thy commandements. 
\v 67 Before I was afflicted, I went astray: but nowe I keepe thy woorde. 
\v 68 Thou art good and gracious: teach me thy statutes. 
\v 69 The proud haue imagined a lie against me: but I wil keepe thy precepts with my whole heart. 
\v 70 Their heart is fatte as grease: but my delite is in thy Lawe. 
\v 71 It is good for me that I haue beene afflicted, that I may learne thy statutes. 
\v 72 The Lawe of thy mouth is better vnto me, then thousands of golde and siluer. 
\v 73 IOD. Thine hands haue made me and fashioned me: giue mee vnderstanding therefore, that I may learne thy commandements. 
\v 74 So they that feare thee, seeing mee shall reioyce, because I haue trusted in thy worde. 
\v 75 I knowe, O Lord, that thy iudgements are right, and that thou hast afflicted me iustly. 
\v 76 I pray thee that thy mercie may comfort me according to thy promise vnto thy seruant. 
\v 77 Let thy tender mercies come vnto me, that I may liue: for thy Lawe is my delite. 
\v 78 Let the proude be ashamed: for they haue dealt wickedly and falsely with me: but I meditate in thy precepts. 
\v 79 Let such as feare thee turne vnto me, and they that knowe thy testimonies. 
\v 80 Let mine heart bee vpright in thy statutes, that I be not ashamed. 
\v 81 CAPH. My soule fainteth for thy saluation: yet I waite for thy worde. 
\v 82 Mine eyes faile for thy promise, saying, when wilt thou comfort me? 
\v 83 For I am like a bottell in the smoke: yet doe I not forget thy statutes. 
\v 84 Howe many are the dayes of thy seruant? When wilt thou execute iudgement on them that persecute me? 
\v 85 The proude haue digged pittes for mee, which is not after thy Lawe. 
\v 86 All thy commandements are true: they persecute me falsely: helpe me. 
\v 87 They had almost consumed me vpon the earth: but I forsooke not thy precepts. 
\v 88 Quicken me according to thy louing kindnes: so shall I keepe the testimony of thy mouth. 
\v 89 LAMED. O Lord, thy worde endureth for euer in heauen. 
\v 90 Thy trueth is from generation to generation: thou hast layed the foundation of the earth, and it abideth. 
\v 91 They continue euen to this day by thine ordinances: for all are thy seruants. 
\v 92 Except thy Lawe had bene my delite, I should now haue perished in mine affliction. 
\v 93 I wil neuer forget thy precepts: for by them thou hast quickened me. 
\v 94 I am thine, saue me: for I haue sought thy precepts. 
\v 95 The wicked haue waited for me to destroy me: but I will consider thy testimonies. 
\v 96 I haue seene an ende of all perfection: but thy commandement is exceeding large. 
\v 97 MEM. Oh howe loue I thy Lawe! it is my meditation continually. 
\v 98 By thy commandements thou hast made mee wiser then mine enemies: for they are euer with mee. 
\v 99 I haue had more vnderstading then all my teachers: for thy testimonies are my meditation. 
\v 100 I vnderstoode more then the ancient, because I kept thy precepts. 
\v 101 I haue refrained my feete from euery euil way, that I might keepe thy word. 
\v 102 I haue not declined from thy iudgements: for thou didest teach me. 
\v 103 Howe sweete are thy promises vnto my mouth! yea, more then hony vnto my mouth. 
\v 104 By thy precepts I haue gotten vnderstanding: therefore I hate all the wayes of falshoode. 
\v 105 NUN. Thy worde is a lanterne vnto my feete, and a light vnto my path. 
\v 106 I haue sworne and will performe it, that I will keepe thy righteous iudgements. 
\v 107 I am very sore afflicted: O Lord, quicken me according to thy word. 
\v 108 O Lord, I beseeche thee accept the free offerings of my mouth, and teach mee thy iudgements. 
\v 109 My soule is continually in mine hande: yet doe I not forget thy Lawe. 
\v 110 The wicked haue layed a snare for mee: but I swarued not from thy precepts. 
\v 111 Thy testimonies haue I taken as an heritage for euer: for they are the ioy of mine heart. 
\v 112 I haue applied mine heart to fulfill thy statutes alway, euen vnto the ende. 
\v 113 SAMECH. I hate vaine inuentions: but thy Lawe doe I loue. 
\v 114 Thou art my refuge and shield, and I trust in thy worde. 
\v 115 Away from mee, yee wicked: for I will keepe the commandements of my God. 
\v 116 Stablish me according to thy promise, that I may liue, and disappoint me not of mine hope. 
\v 117 Stay thou mee, and I shall be safe, and I will delite continually in thy statutes. 
\v 118 Thou hast troden downe all them that depart from thy statutes: for their deceit is vaine. 
\v 119 Thou hast taken away all ye wicked of the earth like drosse: therefore I loue thy testimonies. 
\v 120 My flesh trembleth for feare of thee, and I am afraide of thy iudgements. 
\v 121 AIN. I haue executed iudgement and iustice: leaue me not to mine oppressours. 
\v 122 Answere for thy seruant in that, which is good, and let not the proude oppresse me. 
\v 123 Mine eyes haue failed in waiting for thy saluation, and for thy iust promise. 
\v 124 Deale with thy seruant according to thy mercie, and teache me thy statutes. 
\v 125 I am thy seruant: graunt mee therefore vnderstanding, that I may knowe thy testimonies. 
\v 126 It is time for thee Lord to worke: for they haue destroyed thy Lawe. 
\v 127 Therefore loue I thy commandements aboue golde, yea, aboue most fine golde. 
\v 128 Therefore I esteeme all thy precepts most iust, and hate all false wayes. 
\v 129 PE. Thy testimonies are wonderfull: therefore doeth my soule keepe them. 
\v 130 The entrance into thy wordes sheweth light, and giueth vnderstanding to the simple. 
\v 131 I opened my mouth and panted, because I loued thy commandements. 
\v 132 Looke vpon mee and bee mercifull vnto me, as thou vsest to doe vnto those that loue thy Name. 
\v 133 Direct my steppes in thy worde, and let none iniquitie haue dominion ouer me. 
\v 134 Deliuer mee from the oppression of men, and I will keepe thy precepts. 
\v 135 Shew the light of thy countenance vpon thy seruant, and teache me thy statutes. 
\v 136 Mine eyes gush out with riuers of water, because they keepe not thy Lawe. 
\v 137 TSADDI. Righteous art thou, O Lord, and iust are thy iudgements. 
\v 138 Thou hast commanded iustice by thy testimonies and trueth especially. 
\v 139 My zeale hath euen consumed mee, because mine enemies haue forgotten thy wordes. 
\v 140 Thy word is prooued most pure, and thy seruant loueth it. 
\v 141 I am small and despised: yet do I not forget thy precepts. 
\v 142 Thy righteousnesse is an euerlasting righteousnes, and thy Lawe is trueth. 
\v 143 Trouble and anguish are come vpon me: yet are thy commandements my delite. 
\v 144 The righteousnes of thy testimonies is euerlasting: graunt me vnderstanding, and I shall liue. 
\v 145 KOPH. I haue cried with my whole heart: heare me, O Lord, and I will keepe thy statutes. 
\v 146 I called vpon thee: saue mee, and I will keepe thy testimonies. 
\v 147 I preuented the morning light, and cried: for I waited on thy word. 
\v 148 Mine eyes preuent the night watches to meditate in thy word. 
\v 149 Heare my voyce according to thy louing kindenesse: O Lord, quicken me according to thy iudgement. 
\v 150 They drawe neere, that follow after malice, and are farre from thy Lawe. 
\v 151 Thou art neere, O Lord: for all thy commandements are true. 
\v 152 I haue knowen long since by thy testimonies, that thou hast established them for euer. 
\v 153 RESH. Beholde mine affliction, and deliuer mee: for I haue not forgotten thy Lawe. 
\v 154 Pleade my cause, and deliuer me: quicken me according vnto thy word. 
\v 155 Saluation is farre from the wicked, because they seeke not thy statutes. 
\v 156 Great are thy tender mercies, O Lord: quicken me according to thy iudgements. 
\v 157 My persecutours and mine oppressours are many: yet doe I not swarue from thy testimonies. 
\v 158 I saw the transgressours and was grieued, because they kept not thy worde. 
\v 159 Consider, O Lord, how I loue thy preceptes: quicken mee according to thy louing kindenesse. 
\v 160 The beginning of thy worde is trueth, and all the iudgements of thy righteousnesse endure for euer. 
\v 161 SCHIN. Princes haue persecuted mee without cause, but mine heart stood in awe of thy wordes. 
\v 162 I reioyce at thy worde, as one that findeth a great spoyle. 
\v 163 I hate falshoode and abhorre it, but thy Lawe doe I loue. 
\v 164 Seuen times a day doe I praise thee, because of thy righteous iudgements. 
\v 165 They that loue thy Law, shall haue great prosperitie, and they shall haue none hurt. 
\v 166 Lord, I haue trusted in thy saluation, and haue done thy commandements. 
\v 167 My soule hath kept thy testimonies: for I loue them exceedingly. 
\v 168 I haue kept thy precepts and thy testimonies: for all my wayes are before thee. 
\v 169 TAV. Let my complaint come before thee, O Lord, and giue me vnderstanding, according vnto thy worde. 
\v 170 Let my supplication come before thee, and deliuer me according to thy promise. 
\v 171 My lippes shall speake praise, when thou hast taught me thy statutes. 
\v 172 My tongue shall intreate of thy word: for all thy commandements are righteous. 
\v 173 Let thine hand helpe me: for I haue chosen thy precepts. 
\v 174 I haue longed for thy saluation, O Lord, and thy Lawe is my delite. 
\v 175 Let my soule liue, and it shall praise thee, and thy iudgements shall helpe me. 
\v 176 I haue gone astraye like a lost sheepe: seeke thy seruant, for I doe not forget thy commandements.

\v 1 A song of degrees. I called vnto the Lord in my trouble, and hee heard me. 
\v 2 Deliuer my soule, O Lord, from lying lippes, and from a deceitfull tongue. 
\v 3 What doeth thy deceitfull tongue bring vnto thee? or what doeth it auaile thee? 
\v 4 It is as the sharpe arrowes of a mightie man, and as the coales of iuniper. 
\v 5 Woe is to me that I remaine in Meschech, and dwell in the tentes of Kedar. 
\v 6 My soule hath too long dwelt with him that hateth peace. 
\v 7 I seeke peace, and when I speake thereof, they are bent to warre.

\v 1 A song of degrees. I will lift mine eyes vnto the mountaines, from whence mine helpe shall come. 
\v 2 Mine helpe commeth from the Lord, which hath made the heauen and the earth. 
\v 3 He wil not suffer thy foote to slippe: for he that keepeth thee, will not slumber. 
\v 4 Beholde, he that keepeth Israel, wil neither slumber nor sleepe. 
\v 5 The Lord is thy keeper: the Lord is thy shadow at thy right hand. 
\v 6 The sunne shall not smite thee by day, nor the moone by night. 
\v 7 The Lord shall preserue thee from all euil: he shall keepe thy soule. 
\v 8 The Lord shall preserue thy going out, and thy comming in from henceforth and for euer.

\v 1 A song of degrees, or Psalme of David. I rejoiced, when they sayd to me, We wil go into the house of the Lord. 
\v 2 Our feete shall stand in thy gates, O Ierusalem. 
\v 3 Ierusalem is builded as a citie, that is compact together in it selfe: 
\v 4 Whereunto the Tribes, euen the Tribes of the Lord go vp according to the testimonie to Israel, to prayse the Name of the Lord. 
\v 5 For there are thrones set for iudgement, euen the thrones of the house of Dauid. 
\v 6 Pray for the peace of Ierusalem: let them prosper that loue thee. 
\v 7 Peace be within thy walles, and prosperitie within thy palaces. 
\v 8 For my brethren and neighbours sakes I will wish thee now prosperitie. 
\v 9 Because of the House of the Lord our God, I will procure thy wealth. 
\c 123  
\p
\v 1 A song of degrees. I lift vp mine eyes to thee, that dwellest in the heauens. 
\v 2 Behold, as the eyes of seruants looke vnto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a mayden vnto the hand of her mistres: so our eyes waite vpon the Lord our God vntil he haue mercie vpon vs. 
\v 3 Haue mercie vpon vs, O Lord, haue mercie vpon vs: for we haue suffered too much contempt. 
\v 4 Our soule is filled too full of ye mocking of the wealthy, and of the despitefulnes of the proude. 
\c 124  
\p
\v 1 A song of degrees, or Psalme of David. If the Lord had not bene on our side, (may Israel now say) 
\v 2 If the Lord had not bene on our side, when men rose vp against vs, 
\v 3 They had then swallowed vs vp quicke, when their wrath was kindled against vs. 
\v 4 Then the waters had drowned vs, and the streame had gone ouer our soule: 
\v 5 Then had the swelling waters gone ouer our soule. 
\v 6 Praysed be the Lord, which hath not giuen vs as a praye vnto their teeth. 
\v 7 Our soule is escaped, euen as a bird out of the snare of the foulers: the snare is broken, and we are deliuered. 
\v 8 Our helpe is in the Name of the Lord, which hath made heauen and earth.

\v 1 A song of degrees. They that trust in the Lord, shalbe as mount Zion, which can not be remooued, but remaineth for euer. 
\v 2 As the mountaines are about Ierusalem: so is the Lord about his people from henceforth and for euer. 
\v 3 For the rod of the wicked shall not rest on the lot of the righteous, least the righteous put forth their hand vnto wickednes. 
\v 4 Doe well, O Lord, vnto those that be good and true in their hearts. 
\v 5 But these that turne aside by their crooked wayes, them shall the Lord leade with the workers of iniquitie: but peace shalbe vpon Israel. 
\c 126  
\p
\v 1 A song of degrees, or Psalme of David. When ye Lord brought againe the captiuitie of Zion, we were like them that dreame. 
\v 2 Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with ioye: then sayd they among the heathen, The Lord hath done great things for them. 
\v 3 The Lord hath done great things for vs, whereof we reioyce. 
\v 4 O Lord, bring againe our captiuitie, as the riuers in the South. 
\v 5 They that sowe in teares, shall reape in ioy. 
\v 6 They went weeping and caried precious seede: but they shall returne with ioye and bring their sheaues.

\p
\v 1 A song of degrees, or Psalme of Salomon. Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vaine that build it: except the Lord keepe the citie, the keeper watcheth in vaine. 
\v 2 It is in vaine for you to rise earely, and to lie downe late, and eate the bread of sorow: but he wil surely giue rest to his beloued. 
\v 3 Beholde, children are the inheritance of the Lord, and the fruite of the wombe his rewarde. 
\v 4 As are the arrowes in the hand of ye strong man: so are the children of youth. 
\v 5 Blessed is the man, that hath his quiuer full of them: for they shall not be ashamed, when they speake with their enemies in the gate.

\p
\v 1 A song of degrees. Blessed is euery one that feareth the Lord and walketh in his wayes. 
\v 2 When thou eatest the labours of thine hands, thou shalt be blessed, and it shall be well with thee. 
\v 3 Thy wife shalbe as the fruitfull vine on the sides of thine house, and thy children like the oliue plantes round about thy table. 
\v 4 Lo, surely thus shall the man be blessed, that feareth the Lord. 
\v 5 The Lord out of Zion shall blesse thee, and thou shalt see the wealth of Ierusalem all the dayes of thy life. 
\v 6 Yea, thou shalt see thy childrens children, and peace vpon Israel.

\v 1 A song of degrees. They haue often times afflicted me from my youth (may Israel nowe say) 
\v 2 They haue often times afflicted me from my youth: but they could not preuaile against me. 
\v 3 The plowers plowed vpon my backe, and made long furrowes. 
\v 4 But the righteous Lord hath cut the cordes of the wicked. 
\v 5 They that hate Zion, shalbe all ashamed and turned backward. 
\v 6 They shalbe as the grasse on the house tops, which withereth afore it commeth forth. 
\v 7 Whereof the mower filleth not his hand, neither the glainer his lap:

\v 2 Lord, heare my voyce: let thine eares attend to the voyce of my prayers. 
\v 3 If thou, O Lord, straightly markest iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand? 
\v 4 But mercie is with thee, that thou mayest be feared. 
\v 5 I haue waited on the Lord: my soule hath waited, and I haue trusted in his worde. 
\v 6 My soule waiteth on the Lord more then the morning watch watcheth for the morning.

\p
\v 1 A song of degrees or Psalme of David. Lord, mine heart is not hautie, neither are mine eyes loftie, neither haue I walked in great matters and hid from me. 
\v 2 Surely I haue behaued my selfe, like one wained from his mother, and kept silence: I am in my selfe as one that is wained. 
\v 3 Let Israel waite on the Lord from hencefoorth and for euer. 
\c 132  
\p
\v 1 A song of degrees. Lord, remember Dauid with all his affliction. 
\v 2 Who sware vnto the Lord, and vowed vnto the mightie God of Iaakob, saying, 
\v 3 I will not enter into the tabernacle of mine house, nor come vpon my pallet or bed, 
\v 4 Nor suffer mine eyes to sleepe, nor mine eye lids to slumber, 
\v 5 Vntill I finde out a place for the Lord, an habitation for the mightie God of Iaakob. 
\v 6 Lo, we heard of it in Ephrathah, and found it in the fieldes of the forest. 
\v 7 We will enter into his Tabernacles, and worship before his footestoole. 
\v 8 Arise, O Lord, to come into thy rest, thou, and the Arke of thy strength. 
\v 9 Let thy Priests be clothed with righteousnesse, and let thy Saints reioyce. 
\v 10 For thy seruant Dauids sake refuse not the face of thine Anointed. 
\v 11 The Lord hath sworne in trueth vnto Dauid, and he wil not shrinke from it, saying, Of the fruite of thy body will I set vpon thy throne. 
\v 12 If thy sonnes keepe my couenant, and my testimonies, that I shall teach them, their sonnes also shall sit vpon thy throne for euer. 
\v 13 For the Lord hath chosen Zion, and loued to dwell in it, saying, 
\v 14 This is my rest for euer: here will I dwell, for I haue a delite therein. 
\v 15 I will surely blesse her vitailes, and will satisfie her poore with bread, 
\v 16 And will clothe her Priests with saluation, and her Saints shall shoute for ioye. 
\v 17 There will I make the horne of Dauid to bud: for I haue ordeined a light for mine Anoynted. 
\v 18 His enemies will I clothe with shame, but on him his crowne shall florish.

\p
\v 1 A song of degrees or Psalme of David. Behold, howe good and howe comely a thing it is, brethren to dwell euen together. 
\v 2 It is like to the precious oyntment vpon the head, that runneth downe vpon the beard, euen vnto Aarons beard, which went downe on the border of his garments:

\v 2 Lift vp your hands to the Sanctuarie, and praise the Lord. 
\v 3 The Lord, that hath made heauen and earth, blesse thee out of Zion. 
\c 135

\v 1 Praise ye the Lord. Praise the Name of the Lord: ye seruants of the Lord, praise him. 
\v 2 Ye that stande in the House of the Lord, and in the courtes of the House of our God, 
\v 3 Praise ye the Lord: for the Lord is good: sing praises vnto his Name: for it is a comely thing.

\v 1 By the riuers of Babel we sate, and there wee wept, when we remembred Zion.

\v 3 Then they that ledde vs captiues, required of vs songs and mirth, when wee had hanged vp our harpes, saying, Sing vs one of the songs of Zion. 
\v 4 Howe shall we sing, said we, a song of the Lord in a strange land? 
\v 5 If I forget thee, O Ierusalem, let my right hand forget to play. 
\v 6 If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleaue to the roofe of my mouth: yea, if I preferre not Ierusalem to my chiefe ioy. 
\v 7 Remember the children of Edom, O Lord, in the day of Ierusalem, which saide, Rase it, rase it to the foundation thereof.

\v 4 All the Kings of the earth shall praise thee, O Lord: for they haue heard the wordes of thy mouth. 
\v 5 And they shall sing of the wayes of the Lord, because the glory of the Lord is great.

\v 1 To him that excelleth. A Psalme of David. O Lord, thou hast tried me and knowen me. 
\v 2 Thou knowest my sitting and my rising: thou vnderstandest my thought afarre off. 
\v 3 Thou compassest my pathes, and my lying downe, and art accustomed to all my wayes. 
\v 4 For there is not a word in my tongue, but loe, thou knowest it wholy, O Lord. 
\v 5 Thou holdest mee straite behinde and before, and layest thine hand vpon me. 
\v 6 Thy knowledge is too wonderfull for mee: it is so high that I cannot attaine vnto it. 
\v 7 Whither shall I goe from thy Spirite? or whither shall I flee from thy presence? 
\v 8 If I ascende into heauen, thou art there: if I lye downe in hell, thou art there. 
\v 9 Let mee take the winges of the morning, and dwell in the vttermost parts of the sea: 
\v 10 Yet thither shall thine hand leade me, and thy right hand holde me. 
\v 11 If I say, Yet the darkenes shall hide me, euen the night shalbe light about me. 
\v 12 Yea, the darkenes hideth not from thee: but the night shineth as the day: the darkenes and light are both alike. 
\v 13 For thou hast possessed my reines: thou hast couered me in my mothers wombe. 
\v 14 I will praise thee, for I am fearefully and wonderously made: marueilous are thy workes, and my soule knoweth it well. 
\v 15 My bones are not hid from thee, though I was made in a secret place, and facioned beneath in the earth. 
\v 16 Thine eyes did see me, when I was without forme: for in thy booke were all things written, which in continuance were facioned, when there was none of them before. 
\v 17 Howe deare therefore are thy thoughtes vnto me, O God! how great is ye summe of them! 
\v 18 If I should count them, they are moe then the sand: when I wake, I am still with thee. 
\v 19 Oh that thou wouldest slay, O God, the wicked and bloody men, to whom I say, Depart ye from mee:

\v 21 Doe not I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee? and doe not I earnestly contend with those that rise vp against thee?

\v 1 To him that excelleth. A Psalme of David. Deliuer me, O Lord, from the euill man: preserue me from the cruel man:

\v 6 Therefore I saide vnto the Lord, Thou art my God: heare, O Lord, the voyce of my prayers. 
\v 7 O Lord God the strength of my saluation, thou hast couered mine head in the day of battel. 
\v 8 Let not the wicked haue his desire, O Lord: performe not his wicked thought, least they be proude. Selah. 
\v 9 As for the chiefe of them, that compasse me about, let the mischiefe of their owne lippes come vpon them. 
\v 10 Let coles fal vpon them: let him cast them into the fire, and into the deepe pits, that they rise not. 
\v 11 For the backbiter shall not be established vpon the earth: euill shall hunt the cruell man to destruction.

\v 3 Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth, and keepe the doore of my lips. 
\v 4 Incline not mine heart to euill, that I should commit wicked workes with men that worke iniquitie: and let me not eate of their delicates. 
\v 5 Let the righteous smite me: for that is a benefite: and let him reprooue me, and it shalbe a precious oyle, that shall not breake mine head: for within a while I shall euen pray in their miseries.

\v 1 A Psalme of David, to give instruction, and a prayer, when he was in the cave. I cryed vnto the Lord with my voyce: with my voyce I prayed vnto the Lord. 
\v 2 I powred out my meditation before him, and declared mine affliction in his presence. 
\v 3 Though my spirit was in perplexitie in me, yet thou knewest my path: in the way wherein I walked, haue they priuily layde a snare for me. 
\v 4 I looked vpon my right hand, and beheld, but there was none that would knowe me: all refuge failed me, and none cared for my soule. 
\v 5 Then cryed I vnto thee, O Lord, and sayde, thou art mine hope, and my portion in the land of the liuing. 
\v 6 Hearken vnto my crye, for I am brought very lowe: deliuer me from my persecuters, for they are too strong for me. 
\v 7 Bring my soule out of prison, that I may prayse thy Name: then shall the righteous come about me, when thou art beneficiall vnto me.

\v 3 For the enemie hath persecuted my soule: he hath smitten my life downe to the earth: he hath layde me in the darkenes, as they that haue bene dead long agoe: 
\v 4 And my spirit was in perplexitie in me, and mine heart within me was amased. 
\v 5 Yet do I remember the time past: I meditate in all thy workes, yea, I doe meditate in the workes of thine hands. 
\v 6 I stretche forth mine hands vnto thee: my soule desireth after thee, as the thirstie land. Selah. 
\v 7 Heare me spedely, O Lord, for my spirit faeleth: hide not thy face from me, els I shall be like vnto them that go downe into the pit.

\v 9 Deliuer me, O Lord, from mine enemies: for I hid me with thee. 
\v 10 Teach me to do thy will, for thou art my God: let thy good Spirit leade me vnto the land of righteousnes. 
\v 11 Quicken me, O Lord, for thy Names sake, and for thy righteousnes bring my soule out of trouble.
