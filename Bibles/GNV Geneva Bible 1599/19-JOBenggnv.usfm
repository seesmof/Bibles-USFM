\v 1 There was a man in the lande of Vz called Iob, and this man was an vpright and iust man, one that feared God, and eschewed euill. 
\v 2 And he had seue sonnes, and three daughters. 
\v 3 His substance also was seuen thousande sheepe, and three thousand camels, and fiue hundreth yoke of oxen, and fiue hundreth shee asses, and his family was very great, so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the East. 
\v 4 And his sonnes went and banketted in their houses, euery one his day, and sent, and called their three sisters to eate and to drinke with them. 
\v 5 And when the dayes of their banketting were gone about, Iob sent, and sanctified them, and rose vp early in the morning, and offred burnt offrings according to the nomber of them all. For Iob thought, It may be that my sonnes haue sinned, and blasphemed God in their hearts: thus did Iob euery day. 
\v 6 Nowe on a day when the children of God came and stoode before the Lord, Satan came also among them. 
\v 7 Then the Lord sayde vnto Satan, Whence commest thou? And Satan answered the Lord, saying, From compassing the earth to and from, and from walking in it. 
\v 8 And the Lord saide vnto Satan, Hast thou not considered my seruant Iob, how none is like him in the earth? an vpright and iust man, one that feareth God, and escheweth euill? 
\v 9 Then Satan answered the Lord, and sayde, Doeth Iob feare God for nought? 
\v 10 Hast thou not made an hedge about him and about his house, and about all that he hath on euery side? thou hast blessed the worke of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land. 
\v 11 But stretch out now thine hand and touch all that he hath, to see if he will not blaspheme thee to thy face. 
\v 12 Then the Lord sayde vnto Satan, Lo, all that he hath is in thine hand: onely vpon himselfe shalt thou not stretch out thine hand. So Satan departed from the presence of the Lord. 
\v 13 And on a day, when his sonnes and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brothers house, 
\v 14 There came a messenger vnto Iob, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding in their places, 
\v 15 And the Shabeans came violently, and tooke them: yea, they haue slayne the seruants with the edge of the sworde: but I onely am escaped alone to tell thee. 
\v 16 And whiles he was yet speaking, another came, and sayde, The fire of God is fallen from the heauen, and hath burnt vp the sheepe and the seruants, and deuoured them: but I onely am escaped alone to tell thee. 
\v 17 And whiles he was yet speaking, another came, and sayd, The Caldeans set on three bands, and fell vpon the camels, and haue taken them, and haue slayne the seruantes with the edge of the sworde: but I onely am escaped alone to tell thee. 
\v 18 And whiles he was yet speaking, came an other, and sayd, Thy sonnes, and thy daughters were eating, and drinking wine in their eldest brothers house, 
\v 19 And behold, there came a great wind from beyonde the wildernesse, and smote the foure corners of the house, which fel vpon the children, and they are dead, and I onely am escaped alone to tell thee. 
\v 20 Then Iob arose, and rent his garment, and shaued his head, and fel downe vpon the ground, and worshipped, 
\v 21 And sayd, Naked came I out of my mothers wombe, and naked shall I returne thither: the Lord hath giuen, and the Lord hath taken it: blessed be the Name of the Lord. 
\v 22 In all this did not Iob sinne, nor charge God foolishly. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 And on a day the children of God came and stood before the Lord, and Satan came also among them, and stoode before the Lord. 
\v 2 Then the Lord sayde vnto Satan, Whence commest thou? And Satan answered the Lord, and sayd, From compassing the earth to and from, and from walking in it. 
\v 3 And the Lord sayd vnto Satan, Hast thou not considered my seruant Iob, how none is like him in the earth? an vpright and iust man, one that feareth God, and escheweth euill? for yet he continueth in his vprightnesse, although thou mouedst me against him, to destroy him without cause. 
\v 4 And Satan answered the Lord, and sayde, Skin for skin, and all that euer a man hath, will he giue for his life. 
\v 5 But stretch now out thine hand, and touch his bones and his flesh, to see if he will not blaspheme thee to thy face. 
\v 6 Then the Lord said vnto Satan, Lo, he is in thine hand, but saue his life. 
\v 7 So Satan departed from the presence of the Lord, and smote Iob with sore boyles, from the sole of his foote vnto his crowne. 
\v 8 And he tooke a potsharde to scrape him, and he sate downe among the ashes. 
\v 9 Then said his wife vnto him, Doest thou continue yet in thine vprightnes? Blaspheme God, and dye. 
\v 10 But he said vnto her, Thou speakest like a foolish woman: what? shall we receiue good at the hande of God, and not receiue euill? In all this did not Iob sinne with his lippes. 
\v 11 Nowe when Iobs three friends heard of all this euill that was come vpon him, they came euery one from his owne place, to wit, Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they were agreed together to come to lament with him, and to comfort him. 
\v 12 So when they lift vp their eyes a farre off, they knewe him not: therefore they lift vp their voyces and wept, and euery one of them rent his garment, and sprinkled dust vpon their heads toward the heauen. 
\v 13 So they sate by him vpon the ground seuen dayes, and seuen nights, and none spake a worde vnto him: for they sawe, that the griefe was very great. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 Afterward Iob opened his mouth, and cursed his day. 
\v 2 And Iob cryed out, and sayd, 
\v 3 Let the day perish, wherein I was borne, and the night when it was sayde, There is a man childe conceiued. 
\v 4 Let that day bee darkenesse, let not God regarde it from aboue, neyther let the light shine vpon it, 
\v 5 But let darkenesse, and the shadowe of death staine it: let the cloude remayne vpon it, and let them make it fearefull as a bitter day. 
\v 6 Let darkenesse possesse that night, let it not be ioyned vnto the dayes of the yeere, nor let it come into the count of the moneths. 
\v 7 Yea, desolate be that night, and let no ioy be in it. 
\v 8 Let them that curse the day, (being readie to renue their mourning) curse it. 
\v 9 Let the starres of that twilight be dimme through darkenesse of it: let it looke for light, but haue none: neither let it see the dawning of the day, 
\v 10 Because it shut not vp the dores of my mothers wombe: nor hid sorowe from mine eyes. 
\v 11 Why died I not in the birth? or why dyed I not, when I came out of the wombe? 
\v 12 Why did the knees preuent me? and why did I sucke the breasts? 
\v 13 For so shoulde I now haue lyen and bene quiet, I should haue slept then, and bene at rest, 
\v 14 With the Kings and counselers of the earth, which haue buylded themselues desolate places: 
\v 15 Or with the princes that had golde, and haue filled their houses with siluer. 
\v 16 Or why was I not hid, as an vntimely birth, either as infants, which haue not seene the light? 
\v 17 The wicked haue there ceased from their tyrannie, and there they that laboured valiantly, are at rest. 
\v 18 The prisoners rest together, and heare not the voyce of the oppressour. 
\v 19 There are small and great, and the seruant is free from his master. 
\v 20 Wherefore is the light giuen to him that is in miserie? and life vnto them that haue heauie hearts? 
\v 21 Which long for death, and if it come not, they would euen search it more then treasures: 
\v 22 Which ioy for gladnes, and reioyce, when they can finde the graue. 
\v 23 Why is the light giuen to the man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in? 
\v 24 For my sighing commeth before I eate, and my roarings are powred out like the water. 
\v 25 For the thing I feared, is come vpon me, and the thing that I was afraid of, is come vnto me. 
\v 26 I had no peace, neither had I quietnesse, neither had I rest, yet trouble is come. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered, and sayde, 
\v 2 If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieued? but who can withholde himselfe from speaking? 
\v 3 Behold, thou hast taught many, and hast strengthened the wearie hands. 
\v 4 Thy wordes haue confirmed him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the weake knees. 
\v 5 But now it is come vpon thee, and thou art grieued: it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled. 
\v 6 Is not this thy feare, thy confidence, thy pacience, and the vprightnesse of thy wayes? 
\v 7 Remember, I pray thee: who euer perished, being an innocent? or where were the vpright destroyed? 
\v 8 As I haue seene, they that plow iniquitie, and sowe wickednesse, reape the same. 
\v 9 With the blast of God they perish, and with the breath of his nostrels are they cosumed. 
\v 10 The roaring of the Lion, and the voyce of the Lionesse, and the teeth of the Lions whelpes are broken. 
\v 11 The Lyon perisheth for lacke of pray, and the Lyons whelpes are scattered abroade. 
\v 12 But a thing was brought to me secretly, and mine eare hath receiued a litle thereof. 
\v 13 In the thoughtes of ye visions of the night, when sleepe falleth on men, 
\v 14 Feare came vpon me, and dread which made all my bones to tremble. 
\v 15 And the wind passed before me, and made the heares of my flesh to stande vp. 
\v 16 Then stoode one, and I knewe not his face: an image was before mine eyes, and in silence heard I a voyce, saying, 
\v 17 Shall man be more iust then God? or shall a man be more pure then his maker? 
\v 18 Beholde, he founde no stedfastnesse in his Seruants, and laid follie vpon his Angels. 
\v 19 Howe much more in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which shalbe destroyed before the moth? 
\v 20 They be destroyed from the morning vnto the euening: they perish for euer, without regarde. 
\v 21 Doeth not their dignitie goe away with them? do they not die, and that without wisdom? 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 Call nowe, if any will answere thee, and to which of the Saintes wilt thou turne? 
\v 2 Doubtlesse anger killeth the foolish, and enuie slayeth the idiote. 
\v 3 I haue seene the foolish well rooted, and suddenly I cursed his habitation, saying, 
\v 4 His children shalbe farre from saluation, and they shall be destroyed in the gate, and none shall deliuer them. 
\v 5 The hungrie shall eate vp his haruest: yea, they shall take it from among the thornes, and the thirstie shall drinke vp their substance. 
\v 6 For miserie commeth not foorth of the dust, neither doeth affliction spring out of the earth. 
\v 7 But man is borne vnto trauaile, as the sparkes flie vpwarde. 
\v 8 But I would inquire at God, and turne my talke vnto God: 
\v 9 Which doeth great things and vnsearchable, and marueilous things without nomber. 
\v 10 He giueth raine vpon the earth, and powreth water vpon the streetes, 
\v 11 And setteth vp on hie them that be lowe, that the sorowfull may be exalted to saluation. 
\v 12 He scattereth the deuices of the craftie: so that their handes can not accomplish that which they doe enterprise. 
\v 13 He taketh the wise in their craftinesse, and the counsel of the wicked is made foolish. 
\v 14 They meete with darkenesse in the day time, and grope at noone day, as in the night. 
\v 15 But he saueth the poore from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hande of the violent man, 
\v 16 So that the poore hath his hope, but iniquitie shall stop her mouth. 
\v 17 Beholde, blessed is the man whome God correcteth: therefore refuse not thou the chastising of the Almightie. 
\v 18 For he maketh the wound, and bindeth it vp: he smiteth, and his handes make whole. 
\v 19 He shall deliuer thee in sixe troubles, and in the seuenth the euill shall not touch thee. 
\v 20 In famine he shall deliuer thee from death: and in battel from the power of the sworde. 
\v 21 Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue, and thou shalt not be afraid of destruction when it commeth. 
\v 22 But thou shalt laugh at destruction and dearth, and shalt not be afraide of the beast of the earth. 
\v 23 For the stones of the fielde shall be in league with thee, and the beastes of the field shall be at peace with thee. 
\v 24 And thou shalt knowe, that peace shall be in thy tabernacle, and thou shalt visite thine habitation, and shalt not sinne. 
\v 25 Thou shalt perceiue also, that thy seede shalbe great, and thy posteritie as the grasse of the earth. 
\v 26 Thou shalt goe to thy graue in a ful age, as a ricke of corne commeth in due season into the barne. 
\v 27 Lo, thus haue we inquired of it, and so it is: heare this and knowe it for thy selfe. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1 Bvt Iob answered, and said, 
\v 2 Oh that my griefe were well weighed, and my miseries were layed together in the balance. 
\v 3 For it woulde be nowe heauier then the sande of the sea: therefore my wordes are swallowed vp. 
\v 4 For the arrowes of the Almightie are in me, the venime whereof doeth drinke vp my spirit, and the terrours of God fight against me. 
\v 5 Doeth the wilde asse bray when he hath grasse? or loweth the oxe when he hath fodder? 
\v 6 That which is vnsauerie, shall it be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egge? 
\v 7 Such things as my soule refused to touch, as were sorowes, are my meate. 
\v 8 Oh that I might haue my desire, and that God would grant me the thing that I long for! 
\v 9 That is, that God would destroy me: that he would let his hand go, and cut me off. 
\v 10 Then should I yet haue comfort, (though I burne with sorowe, let him not spare) because I haue not denyed the wordes of the Holy one. 
\v 11 What power haue I that I should endure? or what is mine end, if I should prolong my life? 
\v 12 Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brasse? 
\v 13 Is it not so, that there is in me no helpe? and that strength is taken from me? 
\v 14 He that is in miserie, ought to be comforted of his neighbour: but men haue forsaken the feare of the Almightie. 
\v 15 My brethre haue deceiued me as a brook, and as the rising of the riuers they passe away. 
\v 16 Which are blackish with yee, and wherein the snowe is hid. 
\v 17 But in time they are dryed vp with heate and are consumed: and when it is hote they faile out of their places, 
\v 18 Or they depart from their way and course, yea, they vanish and perish. 
\v 19 They that go to Tema, considered them, and they that goe to Sheba, waited for them. 
\v 20 But they were confounded: when they hoped, they came thither and were ashamed. 
\v 21 Surely nowe are ye like vnto it: ye haue seene my fearefull plague, and are afraide. 
\v 22 Was it because I said, Bring vnto me? or giue a rewarde to me of your substance? 
\v 23 And deliuer me from the enemies hande, or ransome me out of the hand of tyrants? 
\v 24 Teach me, and I wil hold my tongue: and cause me to vnderstande, wherein I haue erred. 
\v 25 Howe stedfast are the wordes of righteousnes? and what can any of you iustly reproue? 
\v 26 Doe ye imagine to reproue wordes, that the talke of the afflicted should be as the winde? 
\v 27 Ye make your wrath to fall vpon the fatherlesse, and dig a pit for your friende. 
\v 28 Nowe therefore be content to looke vpon me: for I will not lie before your face. 
\v 29 Turne, I pray you, let there be none iniquitie: returne, I say, and ye shall see yet my righteousnesse in that behalfe. Is there iniquitie in my tongue? doeth not my mouth feele sorowes? 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1 Is there not an appointed time to man vpon earth? and are not his dayes as the dayes of an hyreling? 
\v 2 As a seruant longeth for the shadowe, and as an hyreling looketh for the ende of his worke, 
\v 3 So haue I had as an inheritance the moneths of vanitie, and painefull nights haue bene appointed vnto me. 
\v 4 If I layed me downe, I sayde, When shall I arise? and measuring the euening I am euen full with tossing to and from vnto the dawning of the day. 
\v 5 My flesh is clothed with wormes and filthinesse of the dust: my skinne is rent, and become horrible. 
\v 6 My dayes are swifter then a weauers shittle, and they are spent without hope. 
\v 7 Remember that my life is but a wind, and that mine eye shall not returne to see pleasure. 
\v 8 The eye that hath seene me, shall see me no more: thine eyes are vpon me, and I shall be no longer. 
\v 9 As the cloude vanisheth and goeth away, so he that goeth downe to the graue, shall come vp no more. 
\v 10 He shall returne no more to his house, neither shall his place knowe him any more. 
\v 11 Therefore I will not spare my mouth, but will speake in the trouble of my spirite, and muse in the bitternesse of my minde. 
\v 12 Am I a sea or a whalefish, that thou keepest me in warde? 
\v 13 When I say, My couch shall relieue me, and my bed shall bring comfort in my meditation, 
\v 14 Then fearest thou me with dreames, and astonishest me with visions. 
\v 15 Therefore my soule chuseth rather to be strangled and to die, then to be in my bones. 
\v 16 I abhorre it, I shall not liue alway: spare me then, for my dayes are but vanitie. 
\v 17 What is man, that thou doest magnifie him, and that thou settest thine heart vpon him? 
\v 18 And doest visite him euery morning, and tryest him euery moment? 
\v 19 Howe long will it be yer thou depart from me? thou wilt not let me alone whiles I may swallowe my spettle. 
\v 20 I haue sinned, what shall I do vnto thee? O thou preseruer of me, why hast thou set me as a marke against thee, so that I am a burden vnto my selfe? 
\v 21 And why doest thou not pardon my trespasse? and take away mine iniquitie? for nowe shall I sleepe in the dust, and if thou seekest me in the morning, I shall not be found. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and saide, 
\v 2 Howe long wilt thou talke of these things? and howe long shall the wordes of thy mouth be as a mightie winde? 
\v 3 Doeth God peruert iudgement? or doeth the Almightie subuert iustice? 
\v 4 If thy sonnes haue sinned against him, and he hath sent them into the place of their iniquitie, 
\v 5 Yet if thou wilt early seeke vnto God, and pray to the Almightie, 
\v 6 If thou be pure and vpright, then surely hee will awake vp vnto thee, and he wil make the habitation of thy righteousnesse prosperous. 
\v 7 And though thy beginning be small, yet thy latter ende shall greatly encrease. 
\v 8 Inquire therefore, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thy selfe to search of their fathers. 
\v 9 (For we are but of yesterday, and are ignorant: for our dayes vpon earth are but a shadowe) 
\v 10 Shall not they teach thee and tell thee, and vtter the wordes of their heart? 
\v 11 Can a rush grow without myre? or can ye grasse growe without water? 
\v 12 Though it were in greene and not cutte downe, yet shall it wither before any other herbe. 
\v 13 So are the paths of al that forget God, and the hypocrites hope shall perish. 
\v 14 His confidence also shalbe cut off, and his trust shalbe as the house of a spyder. 
\v 15 He shall leane vpon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall holde him fast by it, yet shall it not endure. 
\v 16 The tree is greene before the sunne, and the branches spread ouer the garden thereof. 
\v 17 The rootes thereof are wrapped about the fountaine, and are folden about ye house of stones. 
\v 18 If any plucke it from his place, and it denie, saying, I haue not seene thee, 
\v 19 Beholde, it will reioyce by this meanes, that it may growe in another molde. 
\v 20 Behold, God will not cast away an vpright man, neither will he take the wicked by the hand, 
\v 21 Till he haue filled thy mouth with laughter, and thy lippes with ioy. 
\v 22 They that hate thee, shall be clothed with shame, and the dwelling of the wicked shall not remaine. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 Then Iob answered, and sayd, 
\v 2 I knowe verily that it is so: for howe should man compared vnto God, be iustified? 
\v 3 If I would dispute with him, hee could not answere him one thing of a thousand. 
\v 4 He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath bene fierce against him and hath prospered? 
\v 5 He remoueth the mountaines, and they feele not when he ouerthroweth them in his wrath. 
\v 6 Hee remooueth the earth out of her place, that the pillars thereof doe shake. 
\v 7 He commandeth the sunne, and it riseth not: hee closeth vp the starres, as vnder a signet. 
\v 8 Hee himselfe alone spreadeth out the heauens, and walketh vpon the height of the sea. 
\v 9 He maketh the starres Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the climates of the South. 
\v 10 He doeth great things, and vnsearcheable: yea, marueilous things without nomber. 
\v 11 Lo, when he goeth by me, I see him not: and when he passeth by, I perceiue him not. 
\v 12 Behold, when he taketh a pray, who can make him to restore it? who shall say vnto him, What doest thou? 
\v 13 God will not withdrawe his anger, and the most mightie helpes doe stoupe vnder him. 
\v 14 Howe much lesse shall I answere him? or howe should I finde out my words with him? 
\v 15 For though I were iust, yet could I not answere, but I would make supplication to my Iudge. 
\v 16 If I cry, and he answere me, yet woulde I not beleeue, that he heard my voyce. 
\v 17 For he destroyeth mee with a tempest, and woundeth me without cause. 
\v 18 He wil not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitternesse. 
\v 19 If we speake of strength, behold, he is strog: if we speake of iudgement, who shall bring me in to pleade? 
\v 20 If I woulde iustifie my selfe, mine owne mouth shall condemne mee: if I would be perfite, he shall iudge me wicked. 
\v 21 Though I were perfite, yet I knowe not my soule: therefore abhorre I my life. 
\v 22 This is one point: therefore I said, Hee destroyeth the perfite and the wicked. 
\v 23 If the scourge should suddenly slay, should God laugh at the punishment of the innocent? 
\v 24 The earth is giuen into the hand of ye wicked: he couereth the faces of the iudges therof: if not, where is he? or who is he? 
\v 25 My dayes haue bene more swift then a post: they haue fled, and haue seene no good thing. 
\v 26 They are passed as with the most swift ships, and as the eagle that flyeth to the pray. 
\v 27 If I say, I wil forget my complaynt, I will cease from my wrath, and comfort mee, 
\v 28 Then I am afrayd of all my sorowes, knowing that thou wilt not iudge me innocent. 
\v 29 If I be wicked, why labour I thus in vaine? 
\v 30 If I wash my selfe with snowe water, and purge mine hands most cleane, 
\v 31 Yet shalt thou plunge mee in the pit, and mine owne clothes shall make me filthie. 
\v 32 For he is not a man as I am, that I shoulde answere him, if we come together to iudgement. 
\v 33 Neyther is there any vmpire that might lay his hand vpon vs both. 
\v 34 Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his feare astonish me: 
\v 35 Then will I speake, and feare him not: but because I am not so, I holde me still. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1 My soule is cut off though I liue: I wil leaue my complaint vpon my selfe, and wil speake in the bitternesse of my soule. 
\v 2 I will say vnto God, Condemne mee not: shew me, wherefore thou contendest with mee. 
\v 3 Thinkest thou it good to oppresse me, and to cast off the labour of thine handes, and to fauour the counsel of the wicked? 
\v 4 Hast thou carnall eyes? or doest thou see as man seeth? 
\v 5 Are thy dayes as mans dayes? or thy yeres, as the time of man, 
\v 6 That thou inquirest of mine iniquitie, and searchest out my sinne? 
\v 7 Thou knowest that I can not do wickedly: for none can deliuer me out of thine hand. 
\v 8 Thine handes haue made me, and fashioned mee wholy rounde about, and wilt thou destroy me? 
\v 9 Remember, I pray thee, that thou hast made me as the clay, and wilt thou bring me into dust againe? 
\v 10 Hast thou not powred me out as milke? and turned me to cruds like cheese? 
\v 11 Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and ioyned me together with bones and sinewes. 
\v 12 Thou hast giuen me life, and grace: and thy visitation hath preserued my spirit. 
\v 13 Though thou hast hid these things in thine heart, yet I knowe that it is so with thee. 
\v 14 If I haue sinned, then thou wilt streightly looke vnto me, and wilt not holde mee giltlesse of mine iniquitie. 
\v 15 If I haue done wickedly, wo vnto me: if I haue done righteously, I will not lift vp mine head, being full of confusion, because I see mine affliction. 
\v 16 But let it increase: hunt thou me as a lyon: returne and shew thy selfe marueilous vpon me. 
\v 17 Thou renuest thy plagues against me, and thou increasest thy wrath against me: changes and armies of sorowes are against me. 
\v 18 Wherfore then hast thou brought me out of the wombe? Oh that I had perished, and that none eye had seene me! 
\v 19 And that I were as I had not bene, but brought from the wombe to the graue! 
\v 20 Are not my dayes fewe? let him cease, and leaue off from me, that I may take a litle comfort, 
\v 21 Before I goe and shall not returne, euen to the land of darkenesse and shadow of death: 
\v 22 Into a land, I say, darke as darknes it selfe, and into the shadow of death, where is none order, but the light is there as darkenesse. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and sayde, 
\v 2 Should not the multitude of wordes be answered? or should a great talker be iustified? 
\v 3 Should men holde their peace at thy lyes? and when thou mockest others, shall none make thee ashamed? 
\v 4 For thou hast sayde, My doctrine is pure, and I am cleane in thine eyes. 
\v 5 But, oh that God would speake and open his lippes against thee! 
\v 6 That he might shewe thee the secretes of wisedome, howe thou hast deserued double, according to right: know therefore that God hath forgotten thee for thine iniquitie. 
\v 7 Canst thou by searching finde out God? canst thou finde out ye Almighty to his perfection? 
\v 8 The heauens are hie, what canst thou doe? it is deeper then the hell, how canst thou know it? 
\v 9 The measure thereof is longer then the earth, and it is broader then the sea. 
\v 10 If hee cut off and shut vp, or gather together, who can turne him backe? 
\v 11 For hee knoweth vaine men, and seeth iniquitie, and him that vnderstandeth nothing. 
\v 12 Yet vaine man would be wise, though man new borne is like a wilde asse colte. 
\v 13 If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him: 
\v 14 If iniquitie be in thine hand, put it farre away, and let no wickednesse dwell in thy Tabernacle. 
\v 15 The truely shalt thou lift vp thy face without spot, and shalt be stable, and shalt not feare. 
\v 16 But thou shalt forget thy miserie, and remember it as waters that are past. 
\v 17 Thine age also shall appeare more cleare then the noone day: thou shalt shine and bee as the morning. 
\v 18 And thou shalt bee bolde, because there is hope: and thou shalt digge pittes, and shalt lye downe safely. 
\v 19 For when thou takest thy rest, none shall make thee afraide: yea, many shall make sute vnto thee. 
\v 20 But the eyes of the wicked shall faile, and their refuge shall perish, and their hope shalbe sorow of minde. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 Then Iob answered, and sayde, 
\v 2 In deede because that ye are the people onely, wisedome must dye with you. 
\v 3 But I haue vnderstanding aswel as you, and am not inferior vnto you: yea, who knoweth not such things? 
\v 4 I am as one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth vpon God, and he heareth him: the iust and the vpright is laughed to scorne. 
\v 5 Hee that is readie to fall, is as a lampe despised in the opinion of the riche. 
\v 6 The tabernacles of robbers doe prosper, and they are in safetie, that prouoke God, whome God hath enriched with his hand. 
\v 7 Aske now the beasts, and they shall teach thee, and the foules of the heauen, and they shall tell thee: 
\v 8 Or speake to the earth, and it shall shewe thee: or the fishes of the sea, and they shall declare vnto thee. 
\v 9 Who is ignorant of all these, but that the hande of the Lord hath made these? 
\v 10 In whose hande is the soule of euery liuing thing, and the breath of all mankinde. 
\v 11 Doeth not the eares discerne the words? and the mouth taste meate for it selfe? 
\v 12 Among the ancient is wisedome, and in the length of dayes is vnderstanding. 
\v 13 With him is wisedome and strength: he hath counsell and vnderstanding. 
\v 14 Beholde, he will breake downe, and it can not be built: he shutteth a man vp, and he can not be loosed. 
\v 15 Beholde, he withholdeth the waters, and they drie vp: but when he sendeth them out, they destroy the earth. 
\v 16 With him is strength and wisedome: hee that is deceiued, and that deceiueth, are his. 
\v 17 He causeth the counsellers to goe as spoyled, and maketh the iudges fooles. 
\v 18 He looseth the collar of Kings, and girdeth their loynes with a girdle. 
\v 19 He leadeth away the princes as a pray, and ouerthroweth the mightie. 
\v 20 He taketh away the speach from the faithfull counsellers, and taketh away the iudgement of the ancient. 
\v 21 He powreth contempt vpon princes, and maketh the strength of the mightie weake. 
\v 22 He discouereth the deepe places from their darkenesse, and bringeth foorth the shadowe of death to light. 
\v 23 He increaseth the people, and destroyeth them: he inlargeth the nations, and bringeth them in againe. 
\v 24 He taketh away the heartes of the that are the chiefe ouer the people of the earth, and maketh them to wander in the wildernes out of the way. 
\v 25 They grope in the darke without light: and he maketh the to stagger like a drunken man. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 Loe, mine eye hath seene all this: mine eare hath heard, and vnderstande it. 
\v 2 I knowe also as much as you knowe: I am not inferiour vnto you. 
\v 3 But I will speake to the Almightie, and I desire to dispute with God. 
\v 4 For in deede ye forge lyes, and all you are physitions of no value. 
\v 5 Oh, that you woulde holde your tongue, that it might be imputed to you for wisedome! 
\v 6 Nowe heare my disputation, and giue eare to the arguments of my lips. 
\v 7 Will ye speake wickedly for Gods defence, and talke deceitfully for his cause? 
\v 8 Will ye accept his person? or will ye contende for God? 
\v 9 Is it well that he shoulde seeke of you? will you make a lye for him, as one lyeth for a man? 
\v 10 He will surely reprooue you, if ye doe secretly accept any person. 
\v 11 Shall not his excellencie make you afraid? and his feare fall vpon you? 
\v 12 Your memories may be compared vnto ashes, and your bodyes to bodyes of clay. 
\v 13 Holde your tongues in my presence, that I may speake, and let come vpon what will. 
\v 14 Wherefore doe I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my soule in mine hande? 
\v 15 Loe, though he slay me, yet will I trust in him, and I will reprooue my wayes in his sight. 
\v 16 He shalbe my saluation also: for the hypocrite shall not come before him. 
\v 17 Heare diligently my wordes, and marke my talke. 
\v 18 Beholde nowe: if I prepare me to iudgement, I knowe that I shalbe iustified. 
\v 19 Who is he, that will pleade with me? for if I nowe holde my tongue, I dye. 
\v 20 But doe not these two things vnto me: then will I not hide my selfe from thee. 
\v 21 Withdrawe thine hande from me, and let not thy feare make me afraide. 
\v 22 Then call thou, and I will answere: or let me speake, and answere thou me. 
\v 23 Howe many are mine iniquities and sinnes? shewe me my rebellion, and my sinne. 
\v 24 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and takest me for thine enemie? 
\v 25 Wilt thou breake a leafe driuen to and from? and wilt thou pursue the drie stubble? 
\v 26 For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possesse the iniquities of my youth. 
\v 27 Thou puttest my feete also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly vnto all my pathes, and makest the print thereof in ye heeles of my feet. 
\v 28 Such one consumeth like a rotten thing, and as a garment that is motheaten. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1 Man that is borne of woman, is of short continuance, and full of trouble. 
\v 2 He shooteth foorth as a flowre, and is cut downe: he vanisheth also as a shadowe, and continueth not. 
\v 3 And yet thou openest thine eyes vpon such one, and causest me to enter into iudgement with thee. 
\v 4 Who can bring a cleane thing out of filthinesse? there is not one. 
\v 5 Are not his dayes determined? the nober of his moneths are with thee: thou hast appointed his boundes, which he can not passe. 
\v 6 Turne from him that he may cease vntill his desired day, as an hyreling. 
\v 7 For there is hope of a tree, if it bee cut downe, that it will yet sproute, and the branches thereof will not cease. 
\v 8 Though the roote of it waxe olde in the earth, and the stocke thereof be dead in ye ground, 
\v 9 Yet by the sent of water it will bud, and bring foorth boughes like a plant. 
\v 10 But man is sicke, and dyeth, and man perisheth, and where is he? 
\v 11 As the waters passe from the sea, and as the flood decayeth and dryeth vp, 
\v 12 So man sleepeth and riseth not: for hee shall not wake againe, nor be raised from his sleepe till the heauen be no more. 
\v 13 Oh that thou wouldest hide me in the graue, and keepe me secret, vntill thy wrath were past, and wouldest giue me terme, and remember me. 
\v 14 If a man die, shall he liue againe? All the dayes of mine appointed time will I waite, till my changing shall come. 
\v 15 Thou shalt call me, and I shall answere thee: thou louest the worke of thine own hands. 
\v 16 But nowe thou nombrest my steppes, and doest not delay my sinnes. 
\v 17 Mine iniquitie is sealed vp, as in a bagge, and thou addest vnto my wickednesse. 
\v 18 And surely as the mountaine that falleth, commeth to nought, and the rocke that is remooued from his place: 
\v 19 As the water breaketh the stones, when thou ouerflowest the things which growe in the dust of ye earth: so thou destroyest ye hope of man. 
\v 20 Thou preuailest alway against him, so that he passeth away: he changeth his face when thou castest him away. 
\v 21 And he knoweth not if his sonnes shall be honourable, neither shall he vnderstand concerning them, whether they shalbe of lowe degree, 
\v 22 But while his flesh is vpon him, he shall be sorowfull, and while his soule is in him, it shall mourne. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1 Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and saide, 
\v 2 Shal a wise man speake words of ye winde, and fill his bellie with the East winde? 
\v 3 Shall he dispute with wordes not comely? or with talke that is not profitable? 
\v 4 Surely thou hast cast off feare, and restrainest prayer before God. 
\v 5 For thy mouth declareth thine iniquitie, seeing thou hast chosen ye tongue of the crafty. 
\v 6 Thine owne mouth condemneth thee, and not I, and thy lippes testifie against thee. 
\v 7 Art thou the first man, that was borne? and wast thou made before the hils? 
\v 8 Hast thou heard the secret counsell of God, and doest thou restraine wisedome to thee? 
\v 9 What knowest thou that we knowe not? and vnderstandest that is not in vs? 
\v 10 With vs are both auncient and very aged men, farre older then thy father. 
\v 11 Seeme the consolations of God small vnto thee? is this thing strange vnto thee? 
\v 12 Why doeth thine heart take thee away, and what doe thine eyes meane, 
\v 13 That thou answerest to God at thy pleasure, and bringest such wordes out of thy mouth? 
\v 14 What is man, that he should be cleane? and he that is borne of woman, that he shoulde be iust? 
\v 15 Beholde, he founde no stedfastnesse in his Saintes: yea, the heauens are not cleane in his sight. 
\v 16 How much more is man abominable, and filthie, which drinketh iniquitie like water? 
\v 17 I will tell thee: heare me, and I will declare that which I haue seene: 
\v 18 Which wise men haue tolde, as they haue heard of their fathers, and haue not kept it secret: 
\v 19 To whome alone the land was giuen and no stranger passed through them. 
\v 20 The wicked man is continually as one that traueileth of childe, and the nomber of yeeres is hid from the tyrant. 
\v 21 A sounde of feare is in his eares, and in his prosperitie the destroyer shall come vpon him. 
\v 22 He beleeueth not to returne out of darknesse: for he seeth the sworde before him. 
\v 23 He wandreth to and from for bread where he may: he knoweth that the day of darkenesse is prepared at hande. 
\v 24 Affliction and anguish shall make him afraide: they shall preuaile against him as a King readie to the battell. 
\v 25 For he hath stretched out his hand against GOD, and made him selfe strong against the Almightie. 
\v 26 Therefore God shall runne vpon him, euen vpon his necke, and against the most thicke part of his shielde. 
\v 27 Because he hath couered his face with his fatnesse, and hath colloppes in his flancke. 
\v 28 Though he dwell in desolate cities, and in houses which no man inhabiteth, but are become heapes, 
\v 29 He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof in the earth. 
\v 30 He shall neuer depart out of darkenesse: the flame shall drie vp his branches, and he shall goe away with the breath of his mouth. 
\v 31 He beleeueth not that he erreth in vanitie: therefore vanitie shalbe his change. 
\v 32 His branch shall not be greene, but shall be cut off before his day. 
\v 33 God shall destroy him as the vine her sower grape, and shall cast him off, as the oliue doeth her flowre. 
\v 34 For the congregation of the hypocrite shalbe desolate, and fire shall deuoure the houses of bribes. 
\v 35 For they conceiue mischiefe and bring foorth vanitie, and their bellie hath prepared deceite. 
\c 16  
\p
\v 1 Bvt Iob answered, and said, 
\v 2 I haue oft times heard such things: miserable comforters are ye all. 
\v 3 Shall there be none ende of wordes of winde? or what maketh thee bold so to answere? 
\v 4 I could also speake as yee doe: (but woulde God your soule were in my soules stead) I could keepe you company in speaking, and could shake mine head at you, 
\v 5 But I woulde strengthen you with my mouth, and the comfort of my lips should asswage your sorowe. 
\v 6 Though I speake, my sorow can not be asswaged: though I cease, what release haue I? 
\v 7 But now hee maketh mee wearie: O God, thou hast made all my congregation desolate, 
\v 8 And hast made me full of wrinkles which is a witnesse thereof, and my leannes ryseth vp in me, testifying the same in my face. 
\v 9 His wrath hath torne me, and hee hateth me, and gnasheth vpon mee with his teeth: mine enemie hath sharpened his eyes against me. 
\v 10 They haue opened their mouthes vpon me, and smitten me on the cheeke in reproch; they gather themselues together against me. 
\v 11 God hath deliuered me to the vniust, and hath made mee to turne out of the way by the hands of the wicked. 
\v 12 I was in welth, but he hath brought me to nought: he hath taken me by the necke, and beaten me, and set me as a marke for himselfe. 
\v 13 His archers compasse mee rounde about: he cutteth my reines, and doth not spare, and powreth my gall vpon the ground. 
\v 14 He hath broken me with one breaking vpon another, and runneth vpon me like a gyant. 
\v 15 I haue sowed a sackcloth vpon my skinne, and haue abased mine horne vnto the dust. 
\v 16 My face is withered with weeping, and the shadow of death is vpon mine eyes, 
\v 17 Though there be no wickednesse in mine hands, and my prayer be pure. 
\v 18 O earth, couer not thou my blood, and let my crying finde no place. 
\v 19 For lo, now my witnesse is in the heauen, and my record is on hie. 
\v 20 My friends speake eloquently against me: but mine eye powreth out teares vnto God. 
\v 21 Oh that a man might pleade with God, as man with his neighbour! 
\v 22 For the yeeres accounted come, and I shall go the way, whence I shall not returne. 
\c 17  
\p
\v 1 My breath is corrupt: my dayes are cut off, and the graue is readie for me. 
\v 2 There are none but mockers with mee, and mine eye continueth in their bitternesse. 
\v 3 Lay downe nowe and put me in suretie for thee: who is hee, that will touch mine hand? 
\v 4 For thou hast hid their heart from vnderstanding: therefore shalt thou not set them vp on hie. 
\v 5 For the eyes of his children shall faile, that speaketh flattery to his friends. 
\v 6 Hee hath also made mee a byword of the people, and I am as a Tabret before them. 
\v 7 Mine eye therefore is dimme for griefe, and all my strength is like a shadowe. 
\v 8 The righteous shalbe astonied at this, and the innocent shalbe moued against ye hypocrite. 
\v 9 But the righteous wil holde his way, and he whose hands are pure, shall increase his strength. 
\v 10 All you therefore turne you, and come nowe, and I shall not finde one wise among you. 
\v 11 My dayes are past, mine enterprises are broken, and the thoughts of mine heart 
\v 12 Haue changed the nyght for the day, and the light that approched, for darkenesse. 
\v 13 Though I hope, yet the graue shall bee mine house, and I shall make my bed in the darke. 
\v 14 I shall say to corruption, Thou art my father, and to the worme, Thou art my mother and my sister. 
\v 15 Where is then now mine hope? or who shall consider the thing, that I hoped for? 
\v 16 They shall goe downe into the bottome of the pit: surely it shall lye together in the dust. 
\c 18  
\p
\v 1 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 
\v 2 When will yee make an ende of your words? cause vs to vnderstande, and then wee will speake. 
\v 3 Wherefore are wee counted as beastes, and are vile in your sight? 
\v 4 Thou art as one that teareth his soule in his anger. Shall the earth bee forsaken for thy sake? or the rocke remoued out of his place? 
\v 5 Yea, the light of the wicked shalbe quenched, and the sparke of his fire shall not shine. 
\v 6 The light shalbe darke in his dwelling, and his candle shalbe put out with him. 
\v 7 The steps of his strength shalbe restrained, and his owne counsell shall cast him downe. 
\v 8 For hee is taken in the net by his feete, and he walketh vpon the snares. 
\v 9 The grenne shall take him by the heele, and the theefe shall come vpon him. 
\v 10 A snare is layed for him in the ground, and a trappe for him in the way. 
\v 11 Fearefulnesse shall make him afrayde on euery side, and shall driue him to his feete. 
\v 12 His strength shalbe famine: and destruction shalbe readie at his side. 
\v 13 It shall deuoure the inner partes of his skinne, and the first borne of death shall deuoure his strength. 
\v 14 His hope shalbe rooted out of his dwelling, and shall cause him to go to the King of feare. 
\v 15 Feare shall dwell in his house (because it is not his) and brimstone shalbe scattered vpon his habitation. 
\v 16 His rootes shalbe dryed vp beneath, and aboue shall his branche be cut downe. 
\v 17 His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall haue no name in the streete. 
\v 18 They shall driue him out of the light vnto darkenesse, and chase him out of the world. 
\v 19 Hee shall neither haue sonne nor nephewe among his people, nor any posteritie in his dwellings. 
\v 20 The posteritie shalbe astonied at his day, and feare shall come vpon the ancient. 
\v 21 Surely such are the habitations of the wicked, and this is the place of him that knoweth not God. 
\c 19  
\p
\v 1 Bvt Iob answered, and said, 
\v 2 Howe long will yee vexe my soule, and torment me with wordes? 
\v 3 Ye haue now ten times reproched me, and are not ashamed: ye are impudent toward mee. 
\v 4 And though I had in deede erred, mine errour remaineth with me. 
\v 5 But in deede if ye will aduance your selues against me, and rebuke me for my reproche, 
\v 6 Know nowe, that God hath ouerthrowen me, and hath compassed me with his net. 
\v 7 Beholde, I crie out of violence, but I haue none answere: I crie, but there is no iudgement. 
\v 8 Hee hath hedged vp my way that I cannot passe, and he hath set darkenesse in my paths. 
\v 9 Hee hath spoyled mee of mine honour, and taken the crowne away from mine head. 
\v 10 He hath destroyed mee on euery side and I am gone: and he hath remoued mine hope like a tree. 
\v 11 And he hath kindled his wrath against me, and counteth mee as one of his enemies. 
\v 12 His armies came together, and made their way vpon me, and camped about my tabernacle. 
\v 13 He hath remooued my brethre farre from me, and also mine acquaintance were strangers vnto me. 
\v 14 My neighbours haue forsaken me, and my familiars haue forgotten me. 
\v 15 They that dwel in mine house, and my maydes tooke me for a stranger: for I was a stranger in their sight. 
\v 16 I called my seruant, but he would not answere, though I prayed him with my mouth. 
\v 17 My breath was strange vnto my wife, though I prayed her for the childrens sake of mine owne body. 
\v 18 The wicked also despised mee, and when I rose, they spake against me. 
\v 19 All my secret friends abhorred me, and they whome I loued, are turned against me. 
\v 20 My bone cleaueth to my skinne and to my flesh, and I haue escaped with the skinne of my teeth. 
\v 21 Haue pitie vpon me: haue pitie vpon me, (O yee my friendes) for the hande of God hath touched me. 
\v 22 Why do ye persecute me, as God? and are not satisfied with my flesh? 
\v 23 Oh that my wordes were nowe written! oh that they were written euen in a booke, 
\v 24 And grauen with an yron pen in lead, or in stone for euer! 
\v 25 For I am sure, that my Redeemer liueth, and he shall stand the last on the earth. 
\v 26 And though after my skin wormes destroy this bodie, yet shall I see God in my flesh. 
\v 27 Whome I my selfe shall see, and mine eyes shall beholde, and none other for me, though my reynes are consumed within me. 
\v 28 But yee sayde, Why is hee persecuted? And there was a deepe matter in me. 
\v 29 Be ye afraide of the sworde: for the sworde will be auenged of wickednesse, that yee may knowe that there is a iudgement. 
\c 20  
\p
\v 1 Then answered Zophar the Naamathite and saide, 
\v 2 Doubtlesse my thoughts cause me to answere, and therefore I make haste. 
\v 3 I haue heard the correction of my reproch: therefore the spirite of mine vnderstanding causeth me to answere. 
\v 4 Knowest thou not this of olde? and since God placed man vpon the earth, 
\v 5 That the reioycing of the wicked is short, and that the ioy of hypocrites is but a moment? 
\v 6 Though his excellencie mount vp to the heauen, and his head reache vnto the cloudes, 
\v 7 Yet shall hee perish for euer, like his dung, and they which haue seene him, shall say, Where is hee? 
\v 8 He shall flee away as a dreame, and they shall not finde him, and shall passe away as a vision of the night, 
\v 9 So that the eye which had seene him, shall do so no more, and his place shall see him no more. 
\v 10 His children shall flatter the poore, and his hands shall restore his substance. 
\v 11 His bones are full of the sinne of his youth, and it shall lie downe with him in the dust. 
\v 12 When wickednesse was sweete in his mouth, and he hid it vnder his tongue, 
\v 13 And fauoured it, and would not forsake it, but kept it close in his mouth, 
\v 14 Then his meat in his bowels was turned: the gall of Aspes was in the middes of him. 
\v 15 He hath deuoured substance, and hee shall vomit it: for God shall drawe it out of his bellie. 
\v 16 He shall sucke the gall of Aspes, and the vipers tongue shall slay him. 
\v 17 He shall not see the riuers, nor the floods and streames of honie and butter. 
\v 18 He shall restore the labour, and shall deuoure no more: euen according to the substance shalbe his exchange, and he shall enioy it no more. 
\v 19 For he hath vndone many: he hath forsaken the poore, and hath spoyled houses which he builded not. 
\v 20 Surely he shall feele no quietnes in his bodie, neither shall he reserue of that which he desired. 
\v 21 There shall none of his meate bee left: therefore none shall hope for his goods. 
\v 22 When he shalbe filled with his abundance, he shalbe in paine, and the hand of all the wicked shall assaile him. 
\v 23 He shall be about to fill his belly, but God shall sende vpon him his fierce wrath, and shall cause to rayne vpon him, euen vpon his meate. 
\v 24 He shall flee from the yron weapons, and the bow of steele shall strike him through. 
\v 25 The arrowe is drawen out, and commeth forth of the body, and shineth of his gall, so feare commeth vpon him. 
\v 26 All darkenes shalbe hid in his secret places: the fire that is not blowen, shall deuoure him, and that which remaineth in his tabernacle, shalbe destroyed. 
\v 27 The heauen shall declare his wickednes, and the earth shall rise vp against him. 
\v 28 The increase of his house shall go away: it shall flow away in the day of his wrath. 
\v 29 This is the portion of the wicked man from God, and the heritage that he shall haue of God for his wordes. 
\c 21  
\p
\v 1 Bvt Iob answered, and sayd, 
\v 2 Heare diligently my wordes, and this shalbe in stead of your consolations. 
\v 3 Suffer mee, that I may speake, and when I haue spoken, mocke on. 
\v 4 Doe I direct my talke to man? If it were so, how should not my spirit be troubled? 
\v 5 Marke mee, and be abashed, and lay your hand vpon your mouth. 
\v 6 Euen when I remember, I am afrayde, and feare taketh hold on my flesh. 
\v 7 Wherefore do the wicked liue, and waxe olde, and grow in wealth? 
\v 8 Their seede is established in their sight with them, and their generation before their eyes. 
\v 9 Their houses are peaceable without feare, and the rod of God is not vpon them. 
\v 10 Their bullocke gendreth, and fayleth not: their cow calueth, and casteth not her calfe. 
\v 11 They send forth their children like sheepe, and their sonnes dance. 
\v 12 They take the tabret and harpe, and reioyce in the sound of the organs. 
\v 13 They spend their dayes in wealth, and suddenly they go downe to the graue. 
\v 14 They say also vnto God, Depart from vs: for we desire not the knowledge of thy wayes. 
\v 15 Who is the Almightie, that we should serue him? and what profit should we haue, if we should pray vnto him? 
\v 16 Lo, their wealth is not in their hand: therfore let the counsell of the wicked bee farre from me. 
\v 17 How oft shall the candle of the wicked be put out? and their destruction come vpon them? he wil deuide their liues in his wrath. 
\v 18 They shall be as stubble before the winde, and as chaffe that the storme carieth away. 
\v 19 God wil lay vp the sorowe of the father for his children: when he rewardeth him, hee shall knowe it. 
\v 20 His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drinke of the wrath of the Almightie. 
\v 21 For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the nomber of his moneths is cut off? 
\v 22 Shall any teache God knowledge, who iudgeth the highest things? 
\v 23 One dyeth in his full strength, being in all ease and prosperitie. 
\v 24 His breasts are full of milke, and his bones runne full of marowe. 
\v 25 And another dieth in the bitternes of his soule, and neuer eateth with pleasure. 
\v 26 They shall sleepe both in the dust, and the wormes shall couer them. 
\v 27 Behold, I know your thoughts, and the enterprises, wherewith ye do me wrong. 
\v 28 For ye say, Where is the princes house? and where is the tabernacle of the wickeds dwelling? 
\v 29 May ye not aske the that go by the way? and ye can not deny their signes. 
\v 30 But the wicked is kept vnto the day of destruction, and they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath. 
\v 31 Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall reward him for that he hath done? 
\v 32 Yet shall he be brought to the graue, and remaine in the heape. 
\v 33 The slimie valley shalbe sweete vnto him, and euery man shall draw after him, as before him there were innumerable. 
\v 34 How then comfort ye me in vaine, seeing in your answeres there remaine but lyes? 
\c 22  
\p
\v 1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered, and sayde, 
\v 2 May a man be profitable vnto God, as he that is wise, may be profitable to himselfe? 
\v 3 Is it any thing vnto the Almightie, that thou art righteous? or is it profitable to him, that thou makest thy wayes vpright? 
\v 4 Is it for feare of thee that he will accuse thee? or go with thee into iudgement? 
\v 5 Is not thy wickednes great, and thine iniquities innumerable? 
\v 6 For thou hast taken the pledge from thy brother for nought, and spoyled the clothes of the naked. 
\v 7 To such as were wearie, thou hast not giuen water to drinke, and hast withdrawen bread from the hungrie. 
\v 8 But the mightie man had the earth, and he that was in autoritie, dwelt in it. 
\v 9 Thou hast cast out widowes emptie, and the armes of the fatherles were broken. 
\v 10 Therefore snares are round about thee, and feare shall suddenly trouble thee: 
\v 11 Or darkenes that thou shouldest not see, and abundance of waters shall couer thee. 
\v 12 Is not God on hie in the heauen? and behold the height of the starres how hie they are. 
\v 13 But thou sayest, How should God know? can he iudge through the darke cloude? 
\v 14 The cloudes hide him that he can not see, and he walketh in the circle of heauen. 
\v 15 Hast thou marked the way of the worlde, wherein wicked men haue walked? 
\v 16 Which were cut downe before the time, whose foundation was as a riuer that ouerflowed: 
\v 17 Which sayd vnto God, Depart from vs, and asked what the Almightie could do for them. 
\v 18 Yet hee filled their houses with good things: but let the counsell of the wicked be farre from me. 
\v 19 The righteous shall see them, and shall reioyce, and the innocent shall laugh them to scorne. 
\v 20 Surely our substance is hid: but the fire hath deuoured the remnant of them. 
\v 21 Therefore acquaint thy selfe, I pray thee, with him, and make peace: thereby thou shalt haue prosperitie. 
\v 22 Receiue, I pray thee, the law of his mouth, and lay vp his words in thine heart. 
\v 23 If thou returne to the Almightie, thou shalt be buylt vp, and thou shalt put iniquitie farre from thy tabernacle. 
\v 24 Thou shalt lay vp golde for dust, and the gold of Ophir, as the flintes of the riuers. 
\v 25 Yea, the Almightie shalbe thy defence, and thou shalt haue plentie of siluer. 
\v 26 And thou shalt then delite in the Almightie, and lift vp thy face vnto God. 
\v 27 Thou shalt make thy praier vnto him, and he shall heare thee, and thou shalt render thy vowes. 
\v 28 Thou shalt also decree a thing, and he shall establish it vnto thee, and the light shall shine vpon thy wayes. 
\v 29 When others are cast downe, then shalt thou say, I am lifted vp: and God shall saue the humble person. 
\v 30 The innocent shall deliuer the yland, and it shalbe preserued by the purenes of thine hands. 
\c 23  
\p
\v 1 Bvt Iob answered and sayd, 
\v 2 Though my talke be this day in bitternes, and my plague greater then my groning, 
\v 3 Would God yet I knew how to finde him, I would enter vnto his place. 
\v 4 I would pleade the cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments. 
\v 5 I would knowe the wordes, that he would answere me, and would vnderstand what he would say vnto me. 
\v 6 Would he plead against me with his great power? No, but he would put strength in me. 
\v 7 There the righteous might reason with him, so I shoulde be deliuered for euer from my Iudge. 
\v 8 Behold, if I go to the East, he is not there: if to the West, yet I can not perceiue him: 
\v 9 If to the North where he worketh, yet I cannot see him: he wil hide himselfe in the South, and I cannot beholde him. 
\v 10 But he knoweth my way, and trieth mee, and I shall come forth like the gold. 
\v 11 My foote hath followed his steps: his way haue I kept, and haue not declined. 
\v 12 Neyther haue I departed from the commandement of his lippes, and I haue esteemed the words of his mouth more then mine appointed foode. 
\v 13 Yet he is in one minde, and who can turne him? yea, he doeth what his minde desireth. 
\v 14 For he will performe that, which is decreed of me, and many such things are with him. 
\v 15 Therefore I am troubled at his presence, and in considering it, I am afraid of him. 
\v 16 For God hath softened mine heart, and the Almightie hath troubled me. 
\v 17 For I am not cut off in darknesse, but he hath hid the darkenesse from my face. 
\c 24  
\p
\v 1 Howe should not the times be hid from the Almightie, seeing that they which knowe him, see not his dayes? 
\v 2 Some remoue the land marks, that rob the flockes and feede thereof. 
\v 3 They leade away the asse of the fatherles: and take the widowes oxe to pledge. 
\v 4 They make the poore to turne out of the way, so that the poore of the earth hide themselues together. 
\v 5 Behold, others as wilde asses in the wildernesse, goe forth to their businesse, and rise early for a praye: the wildernesse giueth him and his children foode. 
\v 6 They reape his prouision in the fielde, but they gather the late vintage of the wicked. 
\v 7 They cause the naked to lodge without garment, and without couering in the colde. 
\v 8 They are wet with the showres of the moutaines, and they imbrace the rocke for want of a couering. 
\v 9 They plucke the fatherles from the breast, and take the pledge of the poore. 
\v 10 They cause him to go naked without clothing, and take the glening from the hungrie. 
\v 11 They that make oyle betweene their walles, and treade their wine presses, suffer thirst. 
\v 12 Men cry out of the citie, and the soules of the slayne cry out: yet God doth not charge them with follie. 
\v 13 These are they, that abhorre the light: they know not the wayes thereof, nor continue in the paths thereof. 
\v 14 The murtherer riseth earely and killeth the poore and the needie: and in the night he is as a theefe. 
\v 15 The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, and sayth, None eye shall see me, and disguiseth his face. 
\v 16 They digge through houses in the darke, which they marked for themselues in the daye: they knowe not the light. 
\v 17 But the morning is euen to them as the shadow of death: if one knowe them, they are in the terrours of the shadowe of death. 
\v 18 He is swift vpon the waters: their portion shalbe cursed in the earth: he will not behold the way of the vineyardes. 
\v 19 As the dry ground and heate consume the snowe waters, so shall the graue the sinners. 
\v 20 The pitifull man shall forget him: the worme shall feele his sweetenes: he shalbe no more remembered, and the wicked shalbe broke like a tree. 
\v 21 He doth euil intreat ye barren, that doeth not beare, neither doeth he good to the widowe. 
\v 22 He draweth also the mighty by his power, and when he riseth vp, none is sure of life. 
\v 23 Though men giue him assurance to be in safetie, yet his eyes are vpon their wayes. 
\v 24 They are exalted for a litle, but they are gone, and are brought lowe as all others: they are destroyed, and cut off as the toppe of an eare of corne. 
\v 25 But if it be not so, where is he? or who wil proue me a lyer, and make my words of no value? 
\c 25  
\p
\v 1 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and sayd, 
\v 2 Power and feare is with him, that maketh peace in his hie places. 
\v 3 Is there any nomber in his armies? and vpon whom shall not his light arise? 
\v 4 And howe may a man be iustified with God? or how can he be cleane, that is borne of woman? 
\v 5 Behold, he wil giue no light to the moone, and the starres are vncleane in his sight. 
\v 6 How much more man, a worme, euen the sonne of man, which is but a worme? 
\c 26  
\p
\v 1 Bvt Iob answered, and sayde, 
\v 2 Whom helpest thou? him that hath no power? sauest thou the arme that hath no strength? 
\v 3 Whome counsellest thou? him that hath no wisedome? thou shewest right well as the thing is. 
\v 4 To whom doest thou declare these words? or whose spirit commeth out of thee? 
\v 5 The dead things are formed vnder the waters, and neere vnto them. 
\v 6 The graue is naked before him, and there is no couering for destruction. 
\v 7 He stretcheth out the North ouer the emptie place, and hangeth the earth vpon nothing. 
\v 8 He bindeth the waters in his cloudes, and the cloude is not broken vnder them. 
\v 9 He holdeth backe the face of his throne: and spreadeth his cloude vpon it. 
\v 10 He hath set bounds about the waters, vntil the day and night come to an ende. 
\v 11 The pillars of heauen tremble and quake at his reproofe. 
\v 12 The sea is calme by his power, and by his vnderstanding he smiteth the pride thereof. 
\v 13 His Spirite hath garnished the heauens, and his hand hath formed the crooked serpent. 
\v 14 Loe, these are part of his wayes: but how litle a portion heare we of him? and who can vnderstand his fearefull power? 
\c 27  
\p
\v 1 Moreouer Iob proceeded and continued his parable, saying, 
\v 2 The liuing God hath taken away my iudgement: for the Almightie hath put my soule in bitternesse. 
\v 3 Yet so long as my breath is in me, and the Spirit of God in my nostrels, 
\v 4 My lips surely shall speake no wickednesse, and my tongue shall vtter no deceite. 
\v 5 God forbid, that I should iustifie you: vntill I dye, I will neuer take away mine innocencie from my selfe. 
\v 6 I will keepe my righteousnesse, and wil not forsake it: mine heart shall not reprooue me of my dayes. 
\v 7 Mine enemie shall be as the wicked, and he that riseth against me, as the vnrighteous. 
\v 8 For what hope hath the hypocrite when he hath heaped vp riches, if God take away his soule? 
\v 9 Will God heare his cry, when trouble commeth vpon him? 
\v 10 Will he set his delight on the Almightie? will he call vpon God at all times? 
\v 11 I will teache you what is in the hande of God, and I wil not conceale that which is with the Almightie. 
\v 12 Beholde, all ye your selues haue seene it: why then doe you thus vanish in vanitie? 
\v 13 This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of tyrants, which they shall receiue of the Almightie. 
\v 14 If his children be in great nomber, the sworde shall destroy them, and his posteritie shall not be satisfied with bread. 
\v 15 His remnant shall be buried in death, and his widowes shall not weepe. 
\v 16 Though he shoulde heape vp siluer as the dust, and prepare rayment as the clay, 
\v 17 He may prepare it, but the iust shall put it on, and the innocent shall deuide the siluer. 
\v 18 He buildeth his house as the moth, and as a lodge that the watchman maketh. 
\v 19 When the rich man sleepeth, he shall not be gathered to his fathers: they opened their eyes, and he was gone. 
\v 20 Terrours shall take him as waters, and a tempest shall cary him away by night. 
\v 21 The East winde shall take him away, and he shall depart: and it shall hurle him out of his place. 
\v 22 And God shall cast vpon him and not spare, though he would faine flee out of his hand. 
\v 23 Euery man shall clap their hands at him, and hisse at him out of their place. 
\c 28  
\p
\v 1 The siluer surely hath his veyne, and ye gold his place, where they take it. 
\v 2 Yron is taken out of the dust, and brasse is molten out of the stone. 
\v 3 God putteth an end to darkenesse, and he tryeth the perfection of all things: he setteth a bond of darkenesse, and of the shadowe of death. 
\v 4 The flood breaketh out against the inhabitant, and the waters forgotten of the foote, being higher then man, are gone away. 
\v 5 Out of the same earth commeth bread, and vnder it, as it were fire is turned vp. 
\v 6 The stones thereof are a place of saphirs, and the dust of it is golde. 
\v 7 There is a path which no foule hath knowen, neyther hath the kites eye seene it. 
\v 8 The lyons whelpes haue not walked it, nor the lyon passed thereby. 
\v 9 He putteth his hand vpon the rockes, and ouerthroweth the mountaines by the rootes. 
\v 10 He breaketh riuers in the rockes, and his eye seeth euery precious thing. 
\v 11 He bindeth the floods, that they doe not ouerflowe, and the thing that is hid, bringeth he to light. 
\v 12 But where is wisdome found? and where is the place of vnderstanding? 
\v 13 Man knoweth not the price thereof: for it is not found in the land of the liuing. 
\v 14 The depth sayth, It is not in mee: the sea also sayth, It is not with me. 
\v 15 Golde shall not be giuen for it, neyther shall siluer be weighed for the price thereof. 
\v 16 It shall not be valued with the wedge of golde of Ophir, nor with the precious onix, nor the saphir. 
\v 17 The golde nor the chrystall shall be equall vnto it, nor the exchange shalbe for plate of fine golde. 
\v 18 No mention shall be made of coral, nor of the gabish: for wisedome is more precious then pearles. 
\v 19 The Topaz of Ethiopia shall not be equall vnto it, neither shall it be valued with the wedge of pure gold. 
\v 20 Whence then commeth wisedome? and where is the place of vnderstanding, 
\v 21 Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all the liuing, and is hid from the foules of the heauen? 
\v 22 Destruction and death say, We haue heard the fame thereof with our eares. 
\v 23 But God vnderstandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof. 
\v 24 For he beholdeth the endes of the world, and seeth all that is vnder heauen, 
\v 25 To make the weight of the windes, and to weigh the waters by measure. 
\v 26 When he made a decree for the rayne, and a way for the lightening of the thunders, 
\v 27 Then did he see it, and counted it: he prepared it and also considered it. 
\v 28 And vnto man he said, Behold, the feare of the Lord is wisedome, and to depart from euil is vnderstanding. 
\c 29  
\p
\v 1 So Iob proceeded and continued his parable, saying, 
\v 2 Oh that I were as in times past, when God preserued me! 
\v 3 When his light shined vpon mine head: and when by his light I walked thorowe the darkenesse, 
\v 4 As I was in the dayes of my youth: when Gods prouidence was vpon my tabernacle: 
\v 5 When the almightie was yet with me, and my children round about me. 
\v 6 When I washed my pathes with butter, and when the rocke powred me out riuers of oyle: 
\v 7 When I went out to the gate, euen to the iudgement seat, and when I caused them to prepare my seate in the streete. 
\v 8 The yong men saw me, and hid themselues, and the aged arose, and stood vp. 
\v 9 The princes stayed talke, and layde their hand on their mouth. 
\v 10 The voyce of princes was hidde, and their tongue cleaued to the roofe of their mouth. 
\v 11 And when the eare heard me, it blessed me: and when the eye sawe me, it gaue witnesse to me. 
\v 12 For I deliuered the poore that cryed, and the fatherlesse, and him that had none to helpe him. 
\v 13 The blessing of him that was ready to perish, came vpon me, and I caused the widowes heart to reioyce. 
\v 14 I put on iustice, and it couered me: my iudgement was as a robe, and a crowne. 
\v 15 I was the eyes to the blinde, and I was the feete to the lame. 
\v 16 I was a father vnto the poore, and when I knewe not the cause, I sought it out diligently. 
\v 17 I brake also the chawes of the vnrighteous man, and pluckt the praye out of his teeth. 
\v 18 Then I sayde, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiplie my dayes as the sand. 
\v 19 For my roote is spread out by the water, and the dewe shall lye vpon my branche. 
\v 20 My glory shall renue towarde me, and my bowe shall be restored in mine hand. 
\v 21 Vnto me men gaue eare, and wayted, and helde their tongue at my counsell. 
\v 22 After my wordes they replied not, and my talke dropped vpon them. 
\v 23 And they wayted for me, as for the raine, and they opened their mouth as for the latter rayne. 
\v 24 If I laughed on them, they beleeued it not: neither did they cause the light of my countenance to fall. 
\v 25 I appoynted out their way, and did sit as chiefe, and dwelt as a King in the army, and like him that comforteth the mourners. 
\c 30  
\p
\v 1 Bvt now they that are yonger then I, mocke me: yea, they whose fathers I haue refused to set with the dogges of my flockes. 
\v 2 For whereto shoulde the strength of their handes haue serued mee, seeing age perished in them? 
\v 3 For pouertie and famine they were solitary, fleeing into the wildernes, which is darke, desolate and waste. 
\v 4 They cut vp nettels by the bushes, and the iuniper rootes was their meate. 
\v 5 They were chased forth from among men: they shouted at them, as at a theefe. 
\v 6 Therfore they dwelt in the clefts of riuers, in the holes of the earth and rockes. 
\v 7 They roared among the bushes, and vnder the thistles they gathered themselues. 
\v 8 They were the children of fooles and the children of villaines, which were more vile then the earth. 
\v 9 And now am I their song, and I am their talke. 
\v 10 They abhorre me, and flee farre from mee, and spare not to spit in my face. 
\v 11 Because that God hath loosed my corde and humbled mee, they haue loosed the bridle before me. 
\v 12 The youth rise vp at my right hand: they haue pusht my feete, and haue trode on me as on the paths of their destruction. 
\v 13 They haue destroyed my paths: they tooke pleasure at my calamitie, they had none helpe. 
\v 14 They came as a great breach of waters, and vnder this calamitie they come on heapes. 
\v 15 Feare is turned vpon mee: and they pursue my soule as the winde, and mine health passeth away as a cloude. 
\v 16 Therefore my soule is nowe powred out vpon me, and the dayes of affliction haue taken holde on me. 
\v 17 It pearceth my bones in the night, and my sinewes take no rest. 
\v 18 For the great vehemencie is my garment changed, which compasseth me about as the colar of my coate. 
\v 19 He hath cast me into the myre, and I am become like ashes and dust. 
\v 20 Whe I cry vnto thee, thou doest not heare me, neither regardest me, when I stand vp. 
\v 21 Thou turnest thy selfe cruelly against me, and art enemie vnto mee with the strength of thine hand. 
\v 22 Thou takest me vp and causest mee to ride vpon the winde, and makest my strength to faile. 
\v 23 Surely I knowe that thou wilt bring mee to death, and to the house appoynted for all the liuing. 
\v 24 Doubtles none can stretch his hand vnto the graue, though they cry in his destruction. 
\v 25 Did not I weepe with him that was in trouble? was not my soule in heauinesse for the poore? 
\v 26 Yet when I looked for good, euill came vnto me: and when I waited for light, there came darkenesse. 
\v 27 My bowels did boyle without rest: for the dayes of affliction are come vpon me. 
\v 28 I went mourning without sunne: I stood vp in the congregation and cryed. 
\v 29 I am a brother to the dragons, and a companion to the ostriches. 
\v 30 My skinne is blacke vpon me, and my bones are burnt with heate. 
\v 31 Therefore mine harpe is turned to mourning, and mine organs into the voyce of them that weepe. 
\c 31  
\p
\v 1 I made a couenant with mine eyes: why then should I thinke on a mayde? 
\v 2 For what portion should I haue of God from aboue? and what inheritance of the Almightie from on hie? 
\v 3 Is not destruction to the wicked and strange punishment to the workers of iniquitie? 
\v 4 Doeth not he beholde my wayes and tell all my steps? 
\v 5 If I haue walked in vanitie, or if my foote hath made haste to deceite, 
\v 6 Let God weigh me in the iust balance, and he shall know mine vprightnes. 
\v 7 If my steppe hath turned out of the way, or mine heart hath walked after mine eye, or if any blot hath cleaued to mine handes, 
\v 8 Let me sowe, and let another eate: yea, let my plantes be rooted out. 
\v 9 If mine heart hath bene deceiued by a woman, or if I haue layde wayte at the doore of my neighbour, 
\v 10 Let my wife grinde vnto another man, and let other men bow downe vpon her: 
\v 11 For this is a wickednes, and iniquitie to bee condemned: 
\v 12 Yea, this is a fire that shall deuoure to destruction, and which shall roote out al mine increase, 
\v 13 If I did contemne the iudgement of my seruant, and of my mayde, when they did contend with me, 
\v 14 What then shall I do when God standeth vp? and when he shall visit me, what shall I answere? 
\v 15 He that hath made me in the wombe, hath he not made him? hath not he alone facioned vs in the wombe? 
\v 16 If I restrained the poore of their desire, or haue caused the eyes of the widow to faile, 
\v 17 Or haue eaten my morsels alone, and the fatherles hath not eaten thereof, 
\v 18 (For from my youth hee hath growen vp with me as with a father, and from my mothers wombe I haue bene a guide vnto her) 
\v 19 If I haue seene any perish for want of clothing, or any poore without couering, 
\v 20 If his loynes haue not blessed me, because he was warmed with the fleece of my sheepe, 
\v 21 If I haue lift vp mine hande against the fatherlesse, when I saw that I might helpe him in the gate, 
\v 22 Let mine arme fal from my shoulder, and mine arme be broken from the bone. 
\v 23 For Gods punishment was fearefull vnto me, and I could not be deliuered from his highnes. 
\v 24 If I made gold mine hope, or haue sayd to the wedge of golde, Thou art my confidence, 
\v 25 If I reioyced because my substance was great, or because mine hand had gotten much, 
\v 26 If I did behold the sunne, when it shined, or the moone, walking in her brightnes, 
\v 27 If mine heart did flatter me in secrete, or if my mouth did kisse mine hand, 
\v 28 (This also had bene an iniquitie to be condemned: for I had denied the God aboue) 
\v 29 If I reioyced at his destruction that hated me, or was mooued to ioye when euill came vpon him, 
\v 30 Neither haue I suffred my mouth to sinne, by wishing a curse vnto his soule. 
\v 31 Did not the men of my Tabernacle say, Who shall giue vs of his flesh? we can not bee satisfied. 
\v 32 The stranger did not lodge in the streete, but I opened my doores vnto him, that went by the way. 
\v 33 If I haue hid my sinne, as Adam, concealing mine iniquitie in my bosome, 
\v 34 Though I could haue made afraid a great multitude, yet the most contemptible of the families did feare me: so I kept silence, and went not out of the doore. 
\v 35 Oh that I had some to heare me! beholde my signe that the Almightie will witnesse for me: though mine aduersary should write a booke against me, 
\v 36 Woulde not I take it vpon my shoulder, and binde it as a crowne vnto me? 
\v 37 I will tell him the nomber of my goings, and goe vnto him as to a prince. 
\v 38 If my lande cry against me, or the furrowes thereof complayne together, 
\v 39 If I haue eaten the fruites thereof without siluer: or if I haue grieued the soules of the masters thereof, 
\v 40 Let thistles growe in steade of wheate, and cockle in the stead of Barley. The wordes of Iob are ended. 
\c 32  
\p
\v 1 So these three men ceased to answere Iob, because he esteemed himselfe iust. 
\v 2 Then the wrath of Elihu the sonne of Barachel the Buzite, of the familie of Ram, was kindled: his wrath, I say, was kindled against Iob, because he iustified himselfe more then God. 
\v 3 Also his anger was kindled against his three friends, because they could not finde an answere, and yet condemned Iob. 
\v 4 (Now Elihu had wayted til Iob had spoken: for they were more ancient in yeeres then he) 
\v 5 So when Elihu saw, that there was none answere in the mouth of the three men, his wrath was kindled. 
\v 6 Therefore Elihu the sonne of Barachel, the Buzite answered, and sayd, I am yong in yeres, and ye are ancient: therefore I doubted, and was afraide to shewe you mine opinion. 
\v 7 For I said, The dayes shall speake, and the multitude of yeeres shall teach wisedome. 
\v 8 Surely there is a spirite in man, but the inspiration of the Almightie giueth vnderstanding. 
\v 9 Great men are not alway wise, neither doe the aged alway vnderstand iudgement. 
\v 10 Therefore I say, Heare me, and I will shew also mine opinion. 
\v 11 Behold, I did waite vpon your wordes, and hearkened vnto your knowledge, whiles you sought out reasons. 
\v 12 Yea, when I had considered you, lo, there was none of you that reproued Iob, nor answered his wordes: 
\v 13 Lest ye should say, We haue found wisedome: for God hath cast him downe, and no man. 
\v 14 Yet hath he not directed his words to me, neyther will I answere him by your wordes. 
\v 15 Then they fearing, answered no more, but left off their talke. 
\v 16 When I had wayted (for they spake not, but stood still and answered no more) 
\v 17 Then answered I in my turne, and I shewed mine opinion. 
\v 18 For I am full of matter, and the spirite within me compelleth me. 
\v 19 Beholde, my belly is as the wine, which hath no vent, and like the new bottels that brast. 
\v 20 Therefore will I speake, that I may take breath: I will open my lippes, and will answere. 
\v 21 I will not now accept the person of man, neyther will I giue titles to man. 
\v 22 For I may not giue titles, lest my Maker should take me away suddenly. 
\c 33  
\p
\v 1 Wherefore, Iob, I pray thee, heare my talke and hearken vnto all my wordes. 
\v 2 Beholde now, I haue opened my mouth: my tongue hath spoken in my mouth. 
\v 3 My words are in the vprightnesse of mine heart, and my lippes shall speake pure knowledge. 
\v 4 The Spirite of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almightie hath giuen me life. 
\v 5 If thou canst giue me answere, prepare thy selfe and stand before me. 
\v 6 Beholde, I am according to thy wish in Gods stead: I am also formed of the clay. 
\v 7 Beholde, my terrour shall not feare thee, neither shall mine hand be heauie vpon thee. 
\v 8 Doubtles thou hast spoken in mine eares, and I haue heard the voyce of thy wordes. 
\v 9 I am cleane, without sinne: I am innocent, and there is none iniquitie in me. 
\v 10 Lo, he hath found occasions against me, and counted me for his enemie. 
\v 11 He hath put my feete in the stockes, and looketh narrowly vnto all my paths. 
\v 12 Behold, in this hast thou not done right: I will answere thee, that God is greater then man. 
\v 13 Why doest thou striue against him? for he doeth not giue account of all his matters. 
\v 14 For God speaketh once or twise, and one seeth it not. 
\v 15 In dreames and visions of the night, when sleepe falleth vpon men, and they sleepe vpon their beds, 
\v 16 Then he openeth the eares of men, euen by their corrections, which he had sealed, 
\v 17 That he might cause man to turne away from his enterprise, and that he might hide the pride of man, 
\v 18 And keepe backe his soule from the pit, and that his life should not passe by the sword. 
\v 19 He is also striken with sorow vpon his bed, and the griefe of his bones is sore, 
\v 20 So that his life causeth him to abhorre bread, and his soule daintie meate. 
\v 21 His flesh faileth that it can not be seene, and his bones which were not seene, clatter. 
\v 22 So his soule draweth to the graue, and his life to the buriers. 
\v 23 If there be a messenger with him, or an interpreter, one of a thousand to declare vnto man his righteousnesse, 
\v 24 Then will he haue mercie vpon him, and will say, Deliuer him, that he go not downe into the pit: for I haue receiued a reconciliation. 
\v 25 Then shall his flesh be as fresh as a childes, and shall returne as in the dayes of his youth. 
\v 26 He shall pray vnto God, and he will be fauourable vnto him, and he shall see his face with ioy: for he will render vnto man his righteousnes. 
\v 27 He looketh vpon men, and if one say, I haue sinned, and peruerted righteousnesse, and it did not profite me, 
\v 28 He will deliuer his soule from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light. 
\v 29 Lo, all these things will God worke twise or thrise with a man, 
\v 30 That he may turne backe his soule from the pit, to be illuminate in the light of the liuing. 
\v 31 Marke well, O Iob, and heare me: keepe silence, and I will speake. 
\v 32 If there be matter, answere me, and speak: for I desire to iustifie thee. 
\v 33 If thou hast not, heare me: holde thy tongue, and I will teach thee wisedome. 
\c 34  
\p
\v 1 Moreouer Elihu answered, and saide, 
\v 2 Heare my wordes, ye wise men, and hearken vnto me, ye that haue knowledge. 
\v 3 For the eare tryeth the words, as the mouth tasteth meate. 
\v 4 Let vs seeke iudgement among vs, and let vs knowe among our selues what is good. 
\v 5 For Iob hath saide, I am righteous, and God hath taken away my iudgement. 
\v 6 Should I lye in my right? my wound of the arrowe is grieuous without my sinne. 
\v 7 What man is like Iob, that drinketh scornfulnesse like water? 
\v 8 Which goeth in the companie of them that worke iniquitie, and walketh with wicked men? 
\v 9 For he hath saide, It profiteth a man nothing that he should walke with God. 
\v 10 Therefore hearken vnto me, ye men of wisedome, God forbid that wickednesse should be in God, and iniquitie in the Almightie. 
\v 11 For he will render vnto man according to his worke, and cause euery one to finde according to his way. 
\v 12 And certainely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almightie peruert iudgement. 
\v 13 Whome hath he appointed ouer the earth beside him selfe? or who hath placed the whole worlde? 
\v 14 If he set his heart vpon man, and gather vnto him selfe his spirit and his breath, 
\v 15 All flesh shall perish together, and man shall returne vnto dust. 
\v 16 And if thou hast vnderstanding, heare this and hearken to the voyce of my wordes. 
\v 17 Shal he that hateth iudgement, gouerne? and wilt thou iudge him wicked that is most iust? 
\v 18 Wilt thou say vnto a King, Thou art wicked? or to princes, Ye are vngodly? 
\v 19 How much lesse to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, and regardeth not the rich, more then the poore? for they be all the worke of his handes. 
\v 20 They shall die suddenly, and the people shalbe troubled at midnight, and they shall passe foorth and take away the mightie without hand. 
\v 21 For his eyes are vpon the wayes of man, and he seeth all his goings. 
\v 22 There is no darkenesse nor shadowe of death, that the workers of iniquitie might be hid therein. 
\v 23 For he will not lay on man so much, that he should enter into iudgement with God. 
\v 24 He shall breake the mightie without seeking, and shall set vp other in their stead. 
\v 25 Therefore shall he declare their works: he shall turne the night, and they shalbe destroyed. 
\v 26 He striketh them as wicked men in the places of the seers, 
\v 27 Because they haue turned backe from him, and would not consider all his wayes: 
\v 28 So that they haue caused the voyce of the poore to come vnto him, and he hath heard the cry of the afflicted. 
\v 29 And when he giueth quietnesse, who can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who can beholde him, whether it be vpon nations, or vpon a man onely? 
\v 30 Because the hypocrite doeth reigne, and because the people are snared. 
\v 31 Surely it appertaineth vnto God to say, I haue pardoned, I will not destroy. 
\v 32 But if I see not, teach thou me: if I haue done wickedly, I will doe no more. 
\v 33 Wil he performe the thing through thee? for thou hast reproued it, because that thou hast chosen, and not I. now speake what thou knowest. 
\v 34 Let men of vnderstanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken vnto me. 
\v 35 Iob hath not spoken of knowledge, neyther were his wordes according to wisedome. 
\v 36 I desire that Iob may be tryed, vnto the ende touching the answeres for wicked men. 
\v 37 For he addeth rebellion vnto his sinne: he clappeth his handes among vs, and multiplieth his wordes against God. 
\c 35  
\p
\v 1 Elihu spake moreouer, and said, 
\v 2 Thinkest thou this right, that thou hast said, I am more righteous then God? 
\v 3 For thou hast said, What profiteth it thee and what auaileth it me, to purge me from my sinne? 
\v 4 Therefore will I answere thee, and thy companions with thee. 
\v 5 Looke vnto the heauen, and see and behold the cloudes which are hyer then thou. 
\v 6 If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him, yea, when thy sinnes be many, what doest thou vnto him? 
\v 7 If thou be righteous, what giuest thou vnto him? or what receiueth he at thine hand? 
\v 8 Thy wickednesse may hurt a man as thou art: and thy righteousnes may profite ye sonne of man. 
\v 9 They cause many that are oppressed, to crye, which crye out for ye violence of the mightie. 
\v 10 But none saieth, Where is God that made me, which giueth songs in the nyght? 
\v 11 Which teacheth vs more then the beastes of the earth, and giueth vs more wisdome then the foules of the heauen. 
\v 12 Then they crye because of the violence of the wicked, but he answereth not. 
\v 13 Surely God will not heare vanitie, neyther will the Almightie regard it. 
\v 14 Although thou sayest to God, Thou wilt not regard it, yet iudgement is before him: trust thou in him. 
\v 15 But nowe because his anger hath not visited, nor called to count the euill with great extremitie, 
\v 16 Therfore Iob openeth his mouth in vaine, and multiplieth wordes without knowledge. 
\c 36  
\p
\v 1 Elihu also proceeded and sayde, 
\v 2 Suffer me a litle, and I will instruct thee: for I haue yet to speake on Gods behalfe. 
\v 3 I will fetche my knowledge afarre off, and will attribute righteousnes vnto my Maker. 
\v 4 For truely my wordes shall not be false, and he that is perfect in knowledge, speaketh with thee. 
\v 5 Behold, the mighty God casteth away none that is mighty and valiant of courage. 
\v 6 He mainteineth not the wicked, but he giueth iudgement to the afflicted. 
\v 7 He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous, but they are with Kings in ye throne, where he placeth them for euer: thus they are exalted. 
\v 8 And if they bee bound in fetters and tyed with the cordes of affliction, 
\v 9 Then will he shewe them their worke and their sinnes, because they haue bene proude. 
\v 10 He openeth also their eare to discipline, and commandeth them that they returne from iniquity. 
\v 11 If they obey and serue him, they shall end their dayes in prosperity, and their yeres in pleasures. 
\v 12 But if they wil not obey, they shall passe by the sworde, and perish without knowledge. 
\v 13 But the hypocrites of heart increase the wrath: for they call not when he bindeth them. 
\v 14 Their soule dyeth in youth, and their life among the whoremongers. 
\v 15 He deliuereth the poore in his affliction, and openeth their eare in trouble. 
\v 16 Euen so woulde he haue taken thee out of the streight place into a broade place and not shut vp beneath: and that which resteth vpon thy table, had bene full of fat. 
\v 17 But thou art ful of the iudgement of the wicked, though iudgement and equitie maintaine all things. 
\v 18 For Gods wrath is, least hee should take that away in thine abundance: for no multitude of giftes can deliuer thee. 
\v 19 Wil he regard thy riches? he regardeth not golde, nor all them that excel in strength. 
\v 20 Be not carefull in the night, howe he destroyeth the people out of their place. 
\v 21 Take thou heede: looke not to iniquitie: for thou hast chosen it rather then affliction. 
\v 22 Beholde, God exalteth by his power: what teacher is like him? 
\v 23 Who hath appointed to him his way? or who can say, Thou hast done wickedly? 
\v 24 Remember that thou magnifie his worke, which men behold. 
\v 25 All men see it, and men beholde it afarre off. 
\v 26 Beholde, God is excellent, and we knowe him not, neither can the nomber of his yeres bee searched out. 
\v 27 When he restraineth the droppes of water, the rayne powreth down by the vapour thereof, 
\v 28 Which raine the cloudes do droppe and let fall abundantly vpon man. 
\v 29 Who can know the diuisions of ye clouds and the thunders of his tabernacle? 
\v 30 Beholde, he spreadeth his light vpon it, and couereth the bottome of the sea. 
\v 31 For thereby hee iudgeth the people, and giueth meate abundantly. 
\v 32 He couereth the light with the clouds, and commandeth them to go against it. 
\v 33 His companion sheweth him thereof, and there is anger in rising vp. 
\c 37  
\p
\v 1 At this also mine heart is astonied, and is mooued out of his place. 
\v 2 Heare the sound of his voyce, and the noyse that goeth out of his mouth. 
\v 3 He directeth it vnder the whole heauen, and his light vnto the endes of the world. 
\v 4 After it a noyse soundeth: hee thundereth with the voyce of his maiestie, and hee will not stay them when his voyce is heard. 
\v 5 God thundereth marueilously with his voyce: he worketh great things, which we know not. 
\v 6 For he sayth to the snowe, Be thou vpon the earth: likewise to the small rayne and to the great rayne of his power. 
\v 7 With the force thereof he shutteth vp euery man, that all men may knowe his worke. 
\v 8 Then the beastes go into the denne, and remaine in their places. 
\v 9 The whirlewind commeth out of the South, and the colde from the North winde. 
\v 10 At the breath of God the frost is giuen, and the breadth of the waters is made narrowe. 
\v 11 He maketh also the cloudes to labour, to water the earth, and scattereth the cloude of his light. 
\v 12 And it is turned about by his gouernment, that they may doe whatsoeuer he commandeth them vpon the whole worlde: 
\v 13 Whether it be for punishment, or for his lande, or of mercie, he causeth it to come. 
\v 14 Hearken vnto this, O Iob: stand and consider the wonderous workes of God. 
\v 15 Diddest thou knowe when God disposed them? and caused the light of his cloud to shine? 
\v 16 Hast thou knowen the varietie of the cloude, and the wonderous workes of him, that is perfite in knowledge? 
\v 17 Or howe thy clothes are warme, when he maketh the earth quiet through the South winde? 
\v 18 Hast thou stretched out the heaues, which are strong, and as a molten glasse? 
\v 19 Tell vs what we shall say vnto him: for we can not dispose our matter because of darknes. 
\v 20 Shall it be told him when I speake? or shall man speake when he shalbe destroyed? 
\v 21 And nowe men see not the light, which shineth in the cloudes, but the winde passeth and clenseth them. 
\v 22 The brightnesse commeth out of the North: the praise thereof is to God, which is terrible. 
\v 23 It is the Almightie: we can not finde him out: he is excellent in power and iudgement, and aboundant in iustice: he afflicteth not. 
\v 24 Let men therefore feare him: for he will not regarde any that are wise in their owne conceit. 
\c 38  
\p
\v 1 Then answered the Lord vnto Iob out of the whirle winde, and said, 
\v 2 Who is this that darkeneth the counsell by wordes without knowledge? 
\v 3 Girde vp nowe thy loynes like a man: I will demande of thee and declare thou vnto me. 
\v 4 Where wast thou when I layd the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast vnderstanding, 
\v 5 Who hath layde the measures thereof, if thou knowest, or who hath stretched the line ouer it: 
\v 6 Whereupon are the foundations thereof set: or who layed the corner stone thereof: 
\v 7 When the starres of the morning praysed me together, and all the children of God reioyced: 
\v 8 Or who hath shut vp the Sea with doores, when it yssued and came foorth as out of the wombe: 
\v 9 When I made the cloudes as a couering thereof, and darkenesse as the swadeling bands thereof: 
\v 10 When I stablished my commandement vpon it, and set barres and doores, 
\v 11 And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no farther, and here shall it stay thy proude waues. 
\v 12 Hast thou commanded the morning since thy dayes? hast thou caused the morning to knowe his place, 
\v 13 That it might take hold of the corners of the earth, and that the wicked might be shaken out of it? 
\v 14 It is turned as clay to facion, and all stand vp as a garment. 
\v 15 And from the wicked their light shall be taken away, and the hie arme shalbe broken. 
\v 16 Hast thou entred into the bottomes of the sea? or hast thou walked to seeke out the depth? 
\v 17 Haue the gates of death bene opened vnto thee? or hast thou seene the gates of the shadowe of death? 
\v 18 Hast thou perceiued the breadth of the earth? tell if thou knowest all this. 
\v 19 Where is the way where light dwelleth? and where is the place of darkenesse, 
\v 20 That thou shouldest receiue it in the boundes thereof, and that thou shouldest knowe the paths to the house thereof? 
\v 21 Knewest thou it, because thou wast then borne, and because the nomber of thy dayes is great? 
\v 22 Hast thou entred into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seene the treasures of ye haile, 
\v 23 Which I haue hid against the time of trouble, against the day of warre and battell? 
\v 24 By what way is the light parted, which scattereth the East winde vpon the earth? 
\v 25 Who hath deuided the spowtes for the raine? or the way for the lightning of ye thunders, 
\v 26 To cause it to raine on the earth where no man is, and in the wildernes where there is no man? 
\v 27 To fulfil the wilde and waste place, and to cause the bud of the herbe to spring forth? 
\v 28 Who is the father of the rayne? or who hath begotten the droppes of the dewe? 
\v 29 Out of whose wombe came the yee? who hath ingendred the frost of the heauen? 
\v 30 The waters are hid as with a stone: and the face of the depth is frosen. 
\v 31 Canst thou restraine the sweete influences of the Pleiades? or loose the bandes of Orion? 
\v 32 Canst thou bring foorth Mazzaroth in their time? canst thou also guide Arcturus with his sonnes? 
\v 33 Knowest thou the course of heauen, or canst thou set the rule thereof in the earth? 
\v 34 Canst thou lift vp thy voice to the cloudes that the aboundance of water may couer thee? 
\v 35 Canst thou sende the lightenings that they may walke, and say vnto thee, Loe, heere we are? 
\v 36 Who hath put wisedome in the reines? or who hath giuen the heart vnderstanding? 
\v 37 Who can nomber cloudes by wisedome? or who can cause to cease the bottels of heaue, 
\v 38 When the earth groweth into hardnesse, and the clottes are fast together? 
\c 39  
\p
\v 1 Wilt thou hunt the pray for the lyon? or fill the appetite of the lyons whelpes, 
\v 2 When they couch in their places, and remaine in the couert to lye in waite? 
\v 3 Who prepareth for the rauen his meate, when his birdes crie vnto God, wandering for lacke of meate? 
\v 4 Knowest thou the time when the wilde goates bring foorth yong? or doest thou marke when the hindes doe calue? 
\v 5 Canst thou nomber the moneths that they fulfill? or knowest thou the time when they bring foorth? 
\v 6 They bow them selues: they bruise their yong and cast out their sorowes. 
\v 7 Yet their yong waxe fatte, and growe vp with corne: they goe foorth and returne not vnto them. 
\v 8 Who hath set the wilde asse at libertie? or who hath loosed the bondes of the wilde asse? 
\v 9 It is I which haue made the wildernesse his house, and the salt places his dwellings. 
\v 10 He derideth the multitude of the citie: he heareth not the crie of the driuer. 
\v 11 He seeketh out the mountaine for his pasture, and searcheth after euery greene thing. 
\v 12 Will the vnicorne serue thee? or will he tary by thy cribbe? 
\v 13 Canst thou binde the vnicorne with his band to labour in the furrowe? or will he plowe the valleyes after thee? 
\v 14 Wilt thou trust in him, because his strength is great, and cast off thy labour vnto him? 
\v 15 Wilt thou beleeue him, that he will bring home thy seede, and gather it vnto thy barne? 
\v 16 Hast thou giuen the pleasant wings vnto the peacockes? or winges and feathers vnto the ostriche? 
\v 17 Which leaueth his egges in the earth, and maketh them hote in the dust, 
\v 18 And forgetteth that the foote might scatter the, or that the wild beast might breake the. 
\v 19 He sheweth himselfe cruell vnto his yong ones, as they were not his, and is without feare, as if he trauailed in vaine. 
\v 20 For God had depriued him of wisedom, and hath giuen him no part of vnderstanding. 
\v 21 When time is, he mounteth on hie: he mocketh the horse and his rider. 
\v 22 Hast thou giuen the horse strength? or couered his necke with neying? 
\v 23 Hast thou made him afraid as the grashopper? his strong neying is fearefull. 
\v 24 He diggeth in the valley, and reioyceth in his strength: he goeth foorth to meete the harnest man. 
\v 25 He mocketh at feare, and is not afraid, and turneth not backe from the sworde, 
\v 26 Though the quiuer rattle against him, the glittering speare and the shield. 
\v 27 He swalloweth the ground for fearcenes and rage, and he beleeueth not that it is the noise of the trumpet. 
\v 28 He sayth among the trumpets, Ha, ha: hee smellleth the battell afarre off, and the noyse of the captaines, and the shouting. 
\v 29 Shall the hauke flie by thy wisedome, stretching out his wings toward the South? 
\v 30 Doeth the eagle mount vp at thy commandement, or make his nest on hie? 
\v 31 Shee abideth and remaineth in the rocke, euen vpon the toppe of the rocke, and the tower. 
\v 32 From thence she spieth for meate, and her eyes beholde afarre off. 
\v 33 His young ones also sucke vp blood: and where the slaine are, there is she. 
\v 34 Moreouer ye Lord spake vnto Iob, and said, 
\v 35 Is this to learne to striue with the Almightie? he that reprooueth God, let him answere to it. 
\v 36 Then Iob answered the Lord, saying, 
\v 37 Beholde, I am vile: what shall I answere thee? I will lay mine hand vpon my mouth. 
\v 38 Once haue I spoken, but I will answere no more, yea twise, but I will proceede no further. 
\c 40  
\p
\v 1 Againe the Lord answered Iob out of the whirle winde, and said, 
\v 2 Girde vp now thy loynes like a man: I will demaunde of thee, and declare thou vnto me. 
\v 3 Wilt thou disanul my iudgement? or wilt thou condemne me, that thou mayst be iustified? 
\v 4 Or hast thou an arme like God? or doest thou thunder with a voyce like him? 
\v 5 Decke thy selfe now with maiestie and excellencie, and aray thy selfe with beautie and glory. 
\v 6 Cast abroad the indignation of thy wrath, and beholde euery one that is proude, and abase him. 
\v 7 Looke on euery one that is arrogant, and bring him lowe: and destroy the wicked in their place. 
\v 8 Hide them in the dust together, and binde their faces in a secret place. 
\v 9 Then will I confesse vnto thee also, that thy right hand can saue thee. 
\v 10 Behold now Behemoth (whom I made with thee) which eateth grasse as an oxe. 
\v 11 Behold now, his strength is in his loynes, and his force is in the nauil of his belly. 
\v 12 When hee taketh pleasure, his taile is like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapt together. 
\v 13 His bones are like staues of brasse, and his small bones like staues of yron. 
\v 14 He is the chiefe of the wayes of God: he that made him, will make his sworde to approch vnto him. 
\v 15 Surely the mountaines bring him foorth grasse, where all the beastes of the fielde play. 
\v 16 Lyeth hee vnder the trees in the couert of the reede and fennes? 
\v 17 Can the trees couer him with their shadow? or can the willowes of the riuer compasse him about? 
\v 18 Behold, he spoyleth the riuer, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw vp Iorden into his mouth. 
\v 19 Hee taketh it with his eyes, and thrusteth his nose through whatsoeuer meeteth him. 
\v 20 Canst thou drawe out Liuiathan with an hooke, and with a line which thou shalt cast downe vnto his tongue? 
\v 21 Canst thou cast an hooke into his nose? canst thou perce his iawes with an angle? 
\v 22 Will he make many prayers vnto thee, or speake thee faire? 
\v 23 Will hee make a couenant with thee? and wilt thou take him as a seruant for euer? 
\v 24 Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bynd him for thy maydes? 
\v 25 Shall the companions baket with him? shall they deuide him among the marchants? 
\v 26 Canst thou fill the basket with his skinne? or the fishpanier with his head? 
\v 27 Lay thine hand vpon him: remember the battel, and do no more so. 
\v 28 Behold, his hope is in vaine: for shall not one perish euen at the sight of him? 
\c 41  
\p
\v 1 None is so fearce that dare stirre him vp. Who is he then that can stand before me? 
\v 2 Who hath preuented mee that I shoulde make an ende? Al vnder heauen is mine. 
\v 3 I will not keepe silence concerning his partes, nor his power nor his comely proportion. 
\v 4 Who can discouer the face of his garmet? or who shall come to him with a double bridle? 
\v 5 Who shall open the doores of his face? his teeth are fearefull round about. 
\v 6 The maiestie of his scales is like strog shields, and are sure sealed. 
\v 7 One is set to another, that no winde can come betweene them. 
\v 8 One is ioyned to another: they sticke together, that they cannot be sundered. 
\v 9 His niesings make the light to shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning. 
\v 10 Out of his mouth go lampes, and sparkes of fire leape out. 
\v 11 Out of his nostrels commeth out smoke, as out of a boyling pot or caldron. 
\v 12 His breath maketh the coales burne: for a flame goeth out of his mouth. 
\v 13 In his necke remayneth strength, and labour is reiected before his face. 
\v 14 The members of his bodie are ioyned: they are strong in themselues, and cannot be mooued. 
\v 15 His heart is as strong as a stone, and as hard as the nether milstone. 
\v 16 The mightie are afrayd of his maiestie, and for feare they faint in themselues. 
\v 17 When the sword doeth touch him, he will not rise vp, nor for the speare, dart nor habergeon. 
\v 18 He esteemeth yron as strawe, and brasse as rotten wood. 
\v 19 The archer canot make him flee: ye stones of the sling are turned into stubble vnto him: 
\v 20 The dartes are counted as strawe: and hee laugheth at the shaking of the speare. 
\v 21 Sharpe stones are vnder him, and he spreadeth sharpe things vpon the myre. 
\v 22 He maketh the depth to boyle like a pot, and maketh the sea like a pot of oyntment. 
\v 23 He maketh a path to shine after him: one would thinke the depth as an hoare head. 
\v 24 In the earth there is none like him: hee is made without feare. 
\v 25 He beholdeth al hie things: he is a King ouer all the children of pride.

\v 1 Then Iob answered the Lord, and sayd, 
\v 2 I knowe that thou canst doe all things, and that there is no thought hidde from thee. 
\v 3 Who is hee that hideth counsell without knowledge? therefore haue I spoken that I vnderstood not, euen things too wonderfull for me, and which I knew not. 
\v 4 Heare, I beseech thee, and I will speake: I will demaunde of thee, and declare thou vnto me. 
\v 5 I haue heard of thee by the hearing of the eare, but now mine eye seeth thee. 
\v 6 Therefore I abhorre my selfe, and repent in dust and ashes. 
\v 7 Now after that the Lord had spoken these wordes vnto Iob, ye Lord also said vnto Eliphaz ye Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for yee haue not spoken of me the thing that is right, like my seruant Iob. 
\v 8 Therefore take vnto you nowe seuen bullockes, and seuen rammes, and go to my seruant Iob, and offer vp for your selues a burnt offring, and my seruant Iob shall pray for you: for I wil accept him, least I should put you to shame, because ye haue not spoken of me the thing, which is right, like my seruant Iob. 
\v 9 So Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the Lord had saide vnto them, and the Lord accepted Iob. 
\v 10 Then the Lord turned the captiuitie of Iob, when he prayed for his friends: also the Lord gaue Iob twise so much as he had before. 
\v 11 Then came vnto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had bene of his acquaintance before, and did eate bread with him in his house, and had compassion of him, and comforted him for al the euil, that the Lord had brought vpon him, and euery man gaue him a piece of money, and euery one an earing of golde. 
\v 12 So the Lord blessed the last dayes of Iob more then the first: for he had foureteene thousand sheepe, and sixe thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand shee asses. 
\v 13 He had also seue sonnes, and three daughters. 
\v 14 And he called the name of one Iemimah, and the name of the seconde Keziah, and the name of the third Keren-happuch. 
\v 15 In all the lande were no women found so faire as the daughters of Iob, and their father gaue them inheritaunce among their brethren. 
\v 16 And after this liued Iob an hundreth and fourtie yeres, and sawe his sonnes, and his sonnes sonnes, euen foure generations. 
\v 17 So Iob dyed, being old, and full of dayes.
