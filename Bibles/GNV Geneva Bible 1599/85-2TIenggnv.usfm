\mt1 THE SECOND EPISTLE OF PAUL THE APOSTLE TO TIMOTHY 
\c 1  
\p
\v 1 Paul an Apostle of Iesus Christ, by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Iesus, 
\v 2 To Timotheus my beloued sonne: Grace, mercie and peace from God the Father, and from Iesus Christ our Lord. 
\v 3 I thanke God, whom I serue from mine elders with pure conscience, that without ceasing I haue remembrance of thee in my praiers night and day, 
\v 4 Desiring to see thee, mindefull of thy teares, that I may be filled with ioy: 
\v 5 When I call to remembrance the vnfained faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and in thy mother Eunice, and am assured that it dwelleth in thee also. 
\v 6 Wherefore, I put thee in remembrance that thou stirre vp the gift of God which is in thee, by the putting on of mine hands. 
\v 7 For God hath not giuen to vs the Spirite of feare, but of power, and of loue, and of a sound minde. 
\v 8 Be not therefore ashamed of the testimonie of our Lord, neither of me his prisoner: but be partaker of the afflictions of the Gospel, according to the power of God, 
\v 9 Who hath saued vs, and called vs with an holy calling, not according to our workes, but according to his owne purpose and grace, which was giuen to vs through Christ Iesus before the world was, 
\v 10 But is nowe made manifest by that appearing of our Sauiour Iesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortalitie vnto light through the Gospel. 
\v 11 Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and Apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles. 
\v 12 For the which cause I also suffer these things, but I am not ashamed: for I knowe whom I haue beleeued, and I am persuaded that he is able to keepe that which I haue committed to him against that day. 
\v 13 Keepe the true paterne of the wholesome wordes, which thou hast heard of me in faith and loue which is in Christ Iesus. 
\v 14 That worthie thing, which was committed to thee, keepe through the holy Ghost, which dwelleth in vs. 
\v 15 This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia, be turned from me: of which sort are Phygellus and Hermogenes. 
\v 16 The Lord giue mercie vnto the house of Onesiphorus: for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chaine, 
\v 17 But when he was at Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me. 
\v 18 The Lord graunt vnto him, that he may finde mercie with the Lord at that day, and in how many things he hath ministred vnto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 Thou therefore, my sonne, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Iesus. 
\v 2 And what things thou hast heard of me, by many witnesses, ye same deliuer to faithfull men, which shalbe able to teache other also. 
\v 3 Thou therefore suffer affliction as a good souldier of Iesus Christ. 
\v 4 No man that warreth, entangleth himselfe with the affaires of this life, because he woulde please him that hath chosen him to be a souldier. 
\v 5 And if any man also striue for a Masterie, he is not crowned, except he striue as he ought to doe. 
\v 6 The husbandman must labour before he receiue the fruites. 
\v 7 Consider what I say: and the Lord giue thee vnderstanding in all things: 
\v 8 Remember that Iesus Christ, made of the seede of Dauid, was raysed againe from the dead according to my Gospel, 
\v 9 Wherein I suffer trouble as an euill doer, euen vnto bondes: but the worde of God is not bounde. 
\v 10 Therefore I suffer all things, for the elects sake, that they might also obtaine the saluation which is in Christ Iesus, with eternall glorie. 
\v 11 It is a true saying, For if we be dead together with him, we also shall liue together with him. 
\v 12 If we suffer, we shall also reigne together with him: if we denie him, he also will denie vs. 
\v 13 If we beleeue not, yet abideth he faithfull: he cannot denie himselfe. 
\v 14 Of these things put them in remembrance, and protest before the Lord, that they striue not about wordes, which is to no profit, but to the peruerting of the hearers. 
\v 15 Studie to shewe thy selfe approued vnto God, a workeman that needeth not to be ashamed, diuiding the worde of trueth aright. 
\v 16 Stay prophane, and vaine babblings: for they shall encrease vnto more vngodlinesse. 
\v 17 And their worde shall fret as a canker: of which sort is Hymeneus and Philetus, 
\v 18 Which as concerning ye trueth haue erred from the marke, saying that the resurrection is past alreadie, and do destroy the faith of certaine. 
\v 19 But the foundation of God remaineth sure, and hath this seale, The Lord knoweth who are his: and, Let euery one that calleth on the Name of Christ, depart from iniquitie. 
\v 20 Notwithstanding in a great house are not onely vessels of gold and of siluer, but also of wood and of earth, and some for honour, and some vnto dishonour. 
\v 21 If any man therefore purge him selfe from these, he shalbe a vessell vnto honour, sanctified, and meete for the Lord, and prepared vnto euery good worke. 
\v 22 Flee also from the lustes of youth, and follow after righteousnes, faith, loue, and peace, with them that call on the Lord with pure heart, 
\v 23 And put away foolish and vnlearned questions, knowing that they ingender strife. 
\v 24 But the seruant of ye Lord must not striue, but must be gentle toward all men, apt to teache, suffering the euill, 
\v 25 Instructing them with meekenesse that are contrary minded, prouing if God at any time will giue them repentance, that they may acknowledge the trueth, 
\v 26 And come to amendment out of that snare of the deuil, of whom they are taken prisoners, to doe his will. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 This knowe also, that in the last dayes shall come perilous times. 
\v 2 For men shalbe louers of their owne selues, couetous, boasters, proud, cursed speakers, disobedient to parents, vnthankefull, vnholy, 
\v 3 Without naturall affection, truce breakers, false accusers, intemperate, fierce, no louers at all of them which are good, 
\v 4 Traitours, headie, high minded, louers of pleasures more then louers of God, 
\v 5 Hauing a shewe of godlinesse, but haue denied the power thereof: turne away therefore from such. 
\v 6 For of this sort are they which creepe into houses, and leade captiue simple women laden with sinnes, and led with diuers lustes, 
\v 7 Which women are euer learning, and are neuer able to come to the acknowledging of the trueth. 
\v 8 And as Iannes and Iambres withstoode Moses, so doe these also resist the trueth, men of corrupt mindes, reprobate concerning the faith. 
\v 9 But they shall preuaile no longer: for their madnesse shalbe euident vnto all men, as theirs also was. 
\v 10 But thou hast fully knowen my doctrine, maner of liuing, purpose, faith, long suffering, loue, patience, 
\v 11 Persecutions, and afflictions which came vnto me at Antiochia, at Iconium, and at Lystri, which persecutions I suffered: but from them all the Lord deliuered me. 
\v 12 Yea, and all that will liue godly in Christ Iesus, shall suffer persecution. 
\v 13 But the euill men and deceiuers, shall waxe worse and worse, deceiuing, and being deceiued. 
\v 14 But continue thou in the thinges which thou hast learned, and which are committed vnto thee, knowing of who thou hast learned them: 
\v 15 And that thou hast knowen the holy Scriptures of a childe, which are able to make thee wise vnto saluation, through the faith which is in Christ Iesus. 
\v 16 For the whole Scripture is giuen by inspiration of God, and is profitable to teache, to conuince, to correct, and to instruct in righteousnesse, 
\v 17 That the man of God may be absolute, being made perfect vnto all good workes. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 I charge thee therefore before God, and before the Lord Iesus Christ, which shall iudge the quicke and dead at that his appearing, and in his kingdome, 
\v 2 Preach the worde: be instant, in season and out of season: improue, rebuke, exhort with all long suffering and doctrine. 
\v 3 For the time will come, when they will not suffer wholesome doctrine: but hauing their eares itching, shall after their owne lustes get them an heape of teachers, 
\v 4 And shall turne their eares from the trueth, and shalbe giuen vnto fables. 
\v 5 But watch thou in all thinges: suffer aduersitie: doe the worke of an Euangelist: cause thy ministerie to be throughly liked of. 
\v 6 For I am nowe readie to be offered, and the time of my departing is at hand. 
\v 7 I haue fought a good fight, and haue finished my course: I haue kept the faith. 
\v 8 For hence foorth is laide vp for me the crowne of righteousnesse, which the Lord the righteous iudge shall giue me at that day: and not to me onely, but vnto all them also that loue that his appearing. 
\v 9 Make speede to come vnto me at once: 
\v 10 For Demas hath forsaken me, and hath embraced this present world, and is departed vnto Thessalonica. Crescens is gone to Galatia, Titus vnto Dalmatia. 
\v 11 Onely Luke is with me. Take Marke and bring him with thee: for he is profitable vnto me to minister. 
\v 12 And Tychicus haue I sent to Ephesus. 
\v 13 The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou commest, bring with thee, and the bookes, but specially the parchments. 
\v 14 Alexander the coppersmith hath done me much euill: the Lord rewarde him according to his workes. 
\v 15 Of whome be thou ware also: for he withstoode our preaching sore. 
\v 16 At my first answering no man assisted me, but all forsooke me: I pray God, that it may not be laide to their charge. 
\v 17 Notwithstanding the Lord assisted me, and strengthened me, that by me the preaching might be fully beleeued, and that al the Gentiles should heare: and I was deliuered out of the mouth of the lion. 
\v 18 And the Lord will deliuer me from euery euil worke, and will preserue me vnto his heauenly kingdome: to whome be praise for euer and euer, Amen. 
\v 19 Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the householde of Onesiphorus. 
\v 20 Erastus abode at Corinthus: Trophimus I left at Miletum sicke. 
\v 21 Make speede to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren. 
\v 22 The Lord Iesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you, Amen. ‘The second Epistle written from Rome vnto Timotheus, the first Bishop elected of the Church of Ephesus, when Paul was presented the second time before the Emperour Nero.’
