\v 1 Nowe the Lord called Moses, and spake vnto him out of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, saying, 
\v 2 Speake vnto the children of Israel, and thou shalt say vnto them, If any of you offer a sacrifice vnto the Lord, ye shall offer your sacrifice of cattell, as of beeues and of the sheepe. 
\v 3 If his sacrifice be a burnt offering of the heard, he shall offer a male without blemish, presenting him of his owne voluntarie will at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation before the Lord. 
\v 4 And he shall put his hande vpon the head of the burnt offering, and it shalbe accepted to the Lord, to be his atonement. 
\v 5 And he shall kill the bullocke before the Lord, and the Priestes Aarons sonnes shall offer the blood, and shall sprinckle it round about vpon the altar, that is by the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation. 
\v 6 Then shall he fley the burnt offering, and cut it in pieces. 
\v 7 So the sonnes of Aaron the Priest shall put fire vpon the altar, and lay the wood in order vpon the fire. 
\v 8 Then the Priestes Aarons sonnes shall lay the parts in order, the head and the kall vpon the wood that is in the fire which is vpon the altar. 
\v 9 But the inwardes thereof and the legges thereof he shall wash in water, and the Priest shall burne all on the altar: for it is a burnt offering, an oblation made by fire, for a sweete sauour vnto the Lord. 
\v 10 And if his sacrifice for the burnt offering be of the flocks (as of the sheepe, or of the goats) he shall offer a male without blemish, 
\v 11 And he shall kill it on the Northside of the altar before the Lord, and the Priestes Aarons sonnes shall sprinckle the blood thereof rounde about vpon the altar. 
\v 12 And he shall cut it in pieces, separating his head and his kall, and the Priest shall lay them in order vpon the wood that lyeth in the fire which is on the altar: 
\v 13 But he shall wash the inwardes, and the legges with water, and the Priest shall offer the whole and burne it vpon the altar: for it is a burnt offering, an oblation made by fire for a sweete sauour vnto the Lord. 
\v 14 And if his sacrifice be a burnt offring to the Lord of ye foules, then he shall offer his sacrifice of the turtle doues, or of the yong pigeons. 
\v 15 And the Priest shall bring it vnto the altar, and wring the necke of it asunder, and burne it on the altar: and the blood thereof shall bee shed vpon the side of the altar. 
\v 16 And he shall plucke out his maw with his fethers, and cast them beside the altar on the East part in the place of the ashes. 
\v 17 And he shall cleaue it with his wings, but not deuide it asunder: and the Priest shall burne it vpon the altar vpon the wood that is in the fire: for it is a burnt offering, an oblation made by fire for a sweete sauour vnto the Lord. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 And when any will offer a meate offering vnto the Lord, his offering shall be of fine floure, and he shall powre oyle vpon it, and put incense thereon, 
\v 2 And shall bring it vnto Aarons sonnes the Priestes, and he shall take thence his handfull of the flowre, and of the oyle with al the incense, and the Priest shall burne it for a memoriall vpon the altar: for it is an offering made by fire for a sweete sauour vnto the Lord. 
\v 3 But the remnant of the meate offering shalbe Aarons and his sonnes: for it is most holy of the Lordes offrings made by fire. 
\v 4 If thou bring also a meate offring baken in the ouen, it shalbe an vnleauened cake of fine floure mingled with oyle, or an vnleauened wafer anointed with oyle. 
\v 5 But if thy meate offring be an oblation of the frying pan, it shall be of fine flowre vnleauened, mingled with oyle. 
\v 6 And thou shalt part it in pieces, and power oyle thereon: for it is a meate offring. 
\v 7 And if thy meate offring be an oblation made in the caldron, it shalbe made of fine floure with oyle. 
\v 8 After, thou shalt bring the meate offering (that is made of these things) vnto the Lord, and shalt present it vnto the Priest, and he shall bring it to the altar, 
\v 9 And the Priest shall take from the meate offring a memoriall of it, and shall burne it vpon the altar: for it is an oblation made by fire for a sweete sauour vnto the Lord. 
\v 10 But that which is left of the meate offring, shalbe Aarons and his sonnes: for it is most holy of the offrings of the Lord made by fire. 
\v 11 All the meate offrings which ye shall offer vnto the Lord, shalbe made without leauen: for ye shall neither burne leauen nor honie in any offring of the Lord made by fire. 
\v 12 In the oblation of the first fruits ye shall offer them vnto the Lord, but they shall not be burnt vpon the altar for a sweete sauour. 
\v 13 (All the meate offrings also shalt thou season with salt, neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the couenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meate offring, but vpon all thine oblations thou shalt offer salt) 
\v 14 If then thou offer a meate offring of thy first fruites vnto the Lord, thou shalt offer for thy meate offering of thy first fruites eares of corne dryed by the fire, and wheate beaten out of the greene eares. 
\v 15 After, thou shalt put oyle vpon it, and lay incense thereon: for it is a meate offring. 
\v 16 And the Priest shall burne the memoriall of it, euen of that that is beaten, and of the oyle of it, with all the incense thereof: for it is an offring vnto the Lord made by fire. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 Also if his oblation be a peace offering, if he will offer of the droue (whether it be male or female) he shall offer such as is without blemish, before the Lord, 
\v 2 And shall put his hande vpon the head of his offering, and kill it at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation: and Aarons sonnes the Priestes shall sprinkle the blood vpon the altar rounde about. 
\v 3 So he shall offer part of the peace offerings as a sacrifice made by fire vnto the Lord, euen the fat that couereth the inwardes, and all the fat that is vpon the inwardes. 
\v 4 He shall also take away the two kidneis, and the fat that is on them, and vpon the flankes, and the kall on the liuer with the kidneis. 
\v 5 And Aarons sonnes shall burne it on the altar, with the burnt offering, which is vpon the wood, that is on the fire: this is a sacrifice made by fire for a sweete sauour vnto the Lord. 
\v 6 Also if his oblation be a peace offring vnto the Lord out of ye flocke, whether it be male or female, he shall offer it without blemish. 
\v 7 If he offer a lambe for his oblation, then he shall bring it before the Lord, 
\v 8 And lay his hand vpon the head of his offring, and shall kill it before the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and Aarons sonnes shall sprinckle the blood thereof round about vpon the altar. 
\v 9 After, of the peace offrings he shall offer an offring made by fire vnto the Lord: he shall take away the fat therof, and the rump altogether, hard by the backe bone, and the fat that couereth the inwardes, and all the fat that is vpon the inwards. 
\v 10 Also hee shall take away the two kidneis, with the fat that is vpon them, and vpon the flankes, and the kall vpon the liuer with the kidneis. 
\v 11 Then the Priest shall burne it vpon the altar, as the meat of an offring made by fire vnto the Lord. 
\v 12 Also if his offring be a goate, then shall he offer it before the Lord, 
\v 13 And shall put his hande vpon the head of it, and kill it before the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and the sonnes of Aaron shall sprinkle the blood thereof vpon the altar round about. 
\v 14 Then he shall offer thereof his offring, euen an offring made by fire vnto the Lord, the fat that couereth the inwardes, and all the fatte that is vpon the inwardes. 
\v 15 Also hee shall take away the two kidneis, and the fat that is vpon them, and vpon ye flankes, and the kall vpon the liuer with the kidneis. 
\v 16 So the Priest shall burne them vpon the altar, as the meate of an offering made by fire for a sweete sauour: all the fatte is the Lordes. 
\v 17 This shalbe a perpetual ordinance for your generations, throughout al your dwellings, so that ye shall eate neither fatte nor blood. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 Moreouer the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Speake vnto the children of Israel, saying, If any shall sinne through ignorance, in any of the commandementes of the Lord, (which ought not to be done) but shall doe contrary to any of them, 
\v 3 If the Priest that is anointed doe sinne (according to the sinne of the people) then shall he offer, for his sinne which hee hath sinned, a yong bullocke without blemish vnto the Lord for a sinne offring, 
\v 4 And hee shall bring the bullocke vnto the dore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation before the Lord, and shall put his hande vpon the bullocks head, and kill the bullocke before the Lord. 
\v 5 And the Priest that is anointed shall take of the bullocks blood, and bring it into the Tabernacle of the Congregation. 
\v 6 Then the Priest shall dippe his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seuen times before the Lord, before the vaile of the Sanctuarie. 
\v 7 The Priest also shall put some of the blood before the Lord, vpon the hornes of the altar of sweete incense, which is in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, then shall hee powre all the rest of the blood of the bullocke at the foote of the altar of burnt offring, which is at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation. 
\v 8 And hee shall take away all the fat of the bullocke for the sinne offring: to wit, the fat that couereth the inwardes, and all the fatte that is about the inwardes. 
\v 9 He shall take away also the two kidneis, and the fat that is vpon them, and vpon the flankes, and the kall vpon the liuer with the kidneis, 
\v 10 As it was taken away from the bullock of the peace offrings, and the Priest shall burne them vpon the altar of burnt offring. 
\v 11 But the skinne of the bullocke, and all his flesh, with his heade, and his legs, and his inwardes, and his dung shall he beare out. 
\v 12 So he shall cary the whole bullocke out of the host vnto a cleane place, where the ashes are powred, and shall burne him on ye wood in the fire: where ye ashes are cast out, shall he be burnt. 
\v 13 And if the whole Congregation of Israel shall sinne through ignorance, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the multitude, and haue done against any of the commandements of the Lord which should not be done, and haue offended: 
\v 14 When the sinne which they haue committed shalbe knowen, then the Congregation shall offer a yong bullocke for the sinne, and bring him before the Tabernacle of the Congregation, 
\v 15 And the Elders of the Congregation shall put their handes vpon the head of the bullocke before the Lord, and he shall kill the bullocke before the Lord. 
\v 16 Then the Priest that is anointed, shall bring of the bullockes blood into the Tabernacle of the Congregation, 
\v 17 And the Priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle it seuen times before the Lord, euen before the vaile. 
\v 18 Also he shall put some of ye blood vpon the hornes of the altar, which is before the Lord, that is in the Tabernacle of the Congregation: then shall he powre all the rest, of the blood at ye foote of the altar of burnt offring, which is at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, 
\v 19 And he shall take all his fat from him, and burne it vpon the altar. 
\v 20 And the Priest shall doe with this bullocke, as he did with the bullocke for his sinne: so shall he do with this: so the Priest shall make an atonement for them, and it shalbe forgiuen them. 
\v 21 For he shall carie the bullocke without the hoste, and burne him as he burned the first bullock: for it is an offring for the sinne of the Congregation. 
\v 22 When a ruler shall sinne, and do through ignorance against any of the commandements of the Lord his God, which should not be done, and shall offend, 
\v 23 If one shewe vnto him his sinne, which he hath committed, the shall he bring for his offring an hee goat without blemish, 
\v 24 And shall lay his hand vpon the heade of the he goate, and kill it in the place where he should kill the burnt offring before the Lord: for it is a sinne offring. 
\v 25 Then the Priest shall take of the blood of the sinne offring with his finger, and put it vpon the hornes of the burnt offring altar, and shall powre the rest of his blood at the foote of the burnt offring altar, 
\v 26 And shall burne all his fat vpon the altar, as the fat of the peace offring: so the Priest shall make an atonement for him, concerning his sinne, and it shalbe forgiuen him. 
\v 27 Likewise if any of the people of ye lande shall sinne through ignoraunce in doing against any of the commandements of the Lord, which should not be done, and shall offend, 
\v 28 If one shewe him his sinne which he hath committed, then he shall bring for his offring, a shee goate without blemish for his sinne which he hath committed, 
\v 29 And he shall lay his hand vpon the head of the sinne offring, and slay the sinne offring in the place of burnt offring. 
\v 30 Then the Priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and put it vpon the hornes of the burnt offring altar, and powre all the rest of the blood thereof at the foote of the altar, 
\v 31 And shall take away all his fat, as the fat of the peace offringes is taken away, and the Priest shall burne it vpon the altar for a sweete sauour vnto the Lord, and the Priest shall make an atonement for him, and it shalbe forgiuen him. 
\v 32 And if he bring a lambe for his sinne offring, he shall bring a female without blemish, 
\v 33 And shall lay his hand vpon the head of the sinne offring, and hee shall slay it for a sinne offring in the place where hee shoulde kill the burnt offring. 
\v 34 Then the Priest shall take of the blood of the sinne offring with his finger, and put it vpon the hornes of the burnt offring altar, and shall powre al the rest of the blood thereof at the foote of the altar. 
\v 35 And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fatte of the lambe of the peace offrings is taken away: then the Priest shall burne it vpon the altar with the oblations of the Lord made by fire, and the Priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his sinne that he hath committed, and it shalbe forgiuen him. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 Also if any haue sinned, that is, If he haue heard the voyce of an othe, and hee can be a witnes, whether he hath seene or knowen of it, if hee doe not vtter it, he shall beare his iniquitie: 
\v 2 Either if one touche any vncleane thing, whether it be a carion of an vncleane beast, or a carion of vncleane cattel, or a carion of vncleane creeping things, and is not ware of it, yet he is vncleane, and hath offended: 
\v 3 Eyther if hee touche any vncleannesse of man (whatsoeuer vncleannes it be, that hee is defiled with) and is not ware of it, and after commeth to the knowledge of it, he hath sinned: 
\v 4 Either if any sweare and pronounce with his lippes to do euill, or to doe good (whatsoeuer it bee that a man shall pronounce with an othe) and it be hid from him, and after knoweth that he hath offended in one of these poyntes, 
\v 5 Whe he hath sinned in any of these things, then he shall confesse that he hath sinned therein. 
\v 6 Therefore shall he bring his trespasse offring vnto the Lord for his sinne which he hath committed, euen a female from ye flocke, be it a lambe or a she goat for a sinne offring, and the Priest shall make an atonement for him, concerning his sinne. 
\v 7 But if he be not able to bring a sheepe, he shall bring for his trespas which he hath committed, two turtle doues, or two yong pigeons vnto the Lord, one for a sinne offring, and the other for a burnt offring. 
\v 8 So he shall bring them vnto the Priest, who shall offer the sinne offring first, and wring the necke of it a sunder, but not plucke it cleane off. 
\v 9 After he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sinne offring vpon the side of the altar, and the rest of the blood shall be shed at the foote of the altar: for it is a sinne offering. 
\v 10 Also he shall offer the seconde for a burnt offring as the maner is: so shall the Priest make an atonement for him (for his sinne which hee hath committed) and it shalbe forgiuen him. 
\v 11 But if he be not able to bring two turtle doues, or two yong pigeons, then he that hath sinned, shall bring for his offring, the tenth parte of an Ephah of fine floure for a sinne offring, he shall put none oyle thereto, neither put any incense thereon: for it is a sinne offering. 
\v 12 Then shall hee bring it to the Priest, and the Priest shall take his handfull of it for the remembrance thereof, and burne it vpon the altar with the offrings of the Lord made by fire: for it is a sinne offring. 
\v 13 So the Priest shall make an atonement for him, as touching his sinne that he hath committed in one of these poyntes, and it shall bee forgiuen him: and the remnant shalbe the Priests, as the meate offring. 
\v 14 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 15 If any person transgresse and sinne through ignorance by taking away things consecrated vnto the Lord, hee shall then bring for his trespasse offring vnto the Lord a ramme without blemish out of the flocke, worth two shekels of siluer by thy estimation after the shekel of the Sanctuarie, for a trespasse offring. 
\v 16 So hee shall restore that wherein hee hath offended, in taking away of the holy thing, and shall put the fift part more thereto, and giue it vnto the Priest: so the Priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of ye trespasse offring, and it shalbe forgiuen him. 
\v 17 Also if any sinne and doe against any of the commandements of the Lord, which ought not to be done, and knowe not and sinne and beare his iniquitie, 
\v 18 Then shall he bring a ramme without blemishe out of the flocke, in thy estimation worth two shekels for a trespasse offring vnto ye Priest: and the Priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance wherein he erred, and was not ware: so it shalbe forgiuen him. 
\v 19 This is the trespasse offring for the trespasse committed against the Lord. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 If any sinne and commit a trespasse against the Lord, and denie vnto his neighbour that, which was take him to keepe, or that which was put to him of trust, or doth by robberie, or by violence oppresse his neighbour, 
\v 3 Or hath found that which was lost, and denieth it, and sweareth falsely, for any of these things that a man doeth, wherein he sinneth: 
\v 4 When, I say, he thus sinneth and trespasseth, he shall then restore the robbery that he robbed, or the thing taken by violence which hee tooke by force, or the thing which was deliuered him to keepe, or the lost thing which he founde, 
\v 5 Or for whatsoeuer he hath sworne falsely, he shall both restore it in the whole summe, and shall adde the fift parte more thereto, and giue it vnto him to whome perteyneth, the same day that he offreth for trespasse. 
\v 6 Also he shall bring for his trespasse vnto the Lord, a ramme without blemish out of the flocke in thy estimation worth two shekels for a trespasse offring vnto the Priest. 
\v 7 And the Priest shall make an atonement for him before the Lord, and it shall be forgiuen him, whatsoeuer thing he hath done, and trespassed therein. 
\v 8 Then the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 9 Commaund Aaron and his sonnes, saying, This is the lawe of the burnt offring, (it is the burnt offring because it burneth vpon the altar al the night vnto the morning, and the fire burneth on the altar) 
\v 10 And the Priest shall put on his linen garment, and shall put on his linen breeches vpon his flesh, and take away the ashes when the fire hath consumed the burnt offring vpon the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar. 
\v 11 After, he shall put off his garments, and put on other raiment, and cary the ashes foorth without the hoste vnto a cleane place. 
\v 12 But the fire vpon the altar shall burne thereon and neuer be put out: wherefore the Priest shall burne wood on it euery morning, and lay the burnt offering in order vpon it, and he shall burne thereon the fat of the peace offrings. 
\v 13 The fire shall euer burne vpon the altar, and neuer go out. 
\v 14 Also this is the lawe of the meate offring, which Aarons sonnes shall offer in the presence of the Lord, before the altar. 
\v 15 He shall euen take thence his handfull of fine flowre of the meate offring and of the oyle, and all the incense which is vpon the meat offring, and shall burne it vpon the altar for a sweete sauour, as a memoriall therefore vnto the Lord: 
\v 16 But the rest thereof shall Aaron and his sonnes eate: it shalbe eaten without leauen in the holy place: in the court of the Tabernacle of the Congregation they shall eate it. 
\v 17 It shall not be baken with leauen: I haue giuen it for their portion of mine offrings made by fire: for it is as the sinne offering and as the trespasse offring. 
\v 18 All the males among the children of Aaron shall eate of it: It shalbe a statute for euer in your generations concerning the offrings of the Lord, made by fire: whatsoeuer toucheth them shall be holy. 
\v 19 Agayne the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 20 This is the offering of Aaron and his sonnes, which they shall offer vnto the Lord in the day when he is anointed: the tenth part of an Ephah of fine floure, for a meate offering perpetuall: halfe of it in ye morning, and halfe thereof at night. 
\v 21 In the frying panne it shalbe made with oyle: thou shalt bring it fryed, and shalt offer the baken pieces of the meate offering for a sweete sauour vnto the Lord. 
\v 22 And the Priest that is anointed in his steade, among his sonnes shall offer it: It is the Lordes ordinance for euer, it shall be burnt altogether. 
\v 23 For euery meate offring of the Priest shall be burnt altogether, it shall not be eaten. 
\v 24 Furthermore, the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 25 Speake vnto Aaron, and vnto his sonnes, and say, This is the Lawe of the sinne offering, In the place where the burnt offring is killed, shall the sinne offring be killed before the Lord, for it is most holy. 
\v 26 The Priest that offreth this sinne offring, shall eate it: in the holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of ye Tabernacle of the Congregation. 
\v 27 Whatsoeuer shall touch the flesh thereof shalbe holy: and when there droppeth of the blood thereof vpon a garment, thou shalt wash that whereon it droppeth in the holy place. 
\v 28 Also the earthen pot that it is sodden in, shalbe broken, but if it be sodden in a brasen pot, it shall both be scoured and washed with water. 
\v 29 All the males among the Priestes shall eate thereof, for it is most holy. 
\v 30 But no sinne offering, whose blood is brought into the Tabernacle of the Congregation to make reconciliation in the holy place, shalbe eaten, but shalbe burnt in the fire. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1 Likewise this is the lawe of the trespasse offering, it is most holy. 
\v 2 In the place where they kill the burnt offering, shall they kill the trespasse offering, and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle rounde about vpon the altar. 
\v 3 All the fat thereof also shall he offer, the rumpe, and the fat that couereth the inwardes. 
\v 4 After he shall take away the two kidneis, with the fat that is on them and vpon the flankes, and the kall on the liuer with the kidneis. 
\v 5 Then the Priest shall burne them vpon the altar, for an offring made by fire vnto the Lord: this is a trespasse offring. 
\v 6 All the males among the Priestes shall eate thereof, it shalbe eaten in the holy place, for it is most holy. 
\v 7 As the sinne offring is, so is the trespasse offring, one lawe serueth for both: that wherewith the Priest shall make atonement, shalbe his. 
\v 8 Also the Priest that offereth any mans burnt offring, shall haue the skinne of the burnt offring which he hath offered. 
\v 9 And all the meate offring that is baken in the ouen, and that is dressed in the pan, and in the frying pan, shall be the Priestes that offereth it. 
\v 10 And euery meate offering mingled with oyle, and that is dry, shall pertaine vnto all the sonnes of Aaron, to all alike. 
\v 11 Furthermore, this is the lawe of the peace offrings, which he shall offer vnto the Lord. 
\v 12 If he offer it to giue thankes, then he shall offer for his thankes offering, vnleauened cakes mingled with oyle, and vnleauened wafers anointed with oyle, and fine floure fryed with the cakes mingled with oyle. 
\v 13 He shall offer also his offring with cakes of leauened bread, for his peace offrings, to giue thankes. 
\v 14 And of all the sacrifice he shall offer one cake for an heaue offering vnto the Lord, and it shalbe the Priestes that sprinckleth the blood of the peace offrings. 
\v 15 Also the flesh of his peace offerings, for thankesgiuing, shalbe eaten the same day that it is offered: he shall leaue nothing thereof vntill the morning. 
\v 16 But if the sacrifice of his offring be a vow, or a free offering, it shalbe eaten the same day that he offreth his sacrifice: and so in the morning the residue thereof shalbe eaten. 
\v 17 But as much of the offered flesh as remaineth vnto the third day, shalbe burnt with fire. 
\v 18 For if any of the flesh of his peace offrings be eaten in the third day, he shall not be accepted that offereth it, neither shall it be reckoned vnto him, but shalbe an abomination: therefore ye person that eateth of it shall beare his iniquitie. 
\v 19 The flesh also that toucheth any vncleane thing, shall not be eaten, but burnt with fire: but of this flesh all that be cleane shall eate thereof. 
\v 20 But if any eate of the flesh of the peace offerings that pertaineth to the Lord, hauing his vncleannesse vpon him, euen the same person shalbe cut off from his people. 
\v 21 Moreouer, whe any toucheth any vncleane thing, as the vncleannesse of man, or of an vncleane beast, or of any filthie abomination, and eate of the flesh of the peace offrings, which pertaineth vnto the Lord, euen that person shalbe cut off from his people. 
\v 22 Againe ye Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 23 Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say, Ye shall eate no fat of beeues, nor of sheepe, nor of goates: 
\v 24 Yet the fat of the dead beast, and the fat of that, which is torne with beastes, shalbe occupied to any vse, but ye shall not eate of it. 
\v 25 For whosoeuer eateth the fat of the beast, of the which he shall offer an offering made by fire to the Lord, euen the person that eateth, shalbe cut off from his people. 
\v 26 Neither shall ye eate any blood, either of foule, or of beast in all your dwellings. 
\v 27 Euery person that eateth any blood, euen the same person shall be cut off from his people. 
\v 28 And the Lord talked with Moses, saying, 
\v 29 Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say, Hee that offereth his peace offerings vnto the Lord, shall bring his gifte vnto the Lord of his peace offerings: 
\v 30 His handes shall bring the offerings of the Lord made by fire: euen the fatte with the breast shall he bring, that the breast may be shaken to and from before the Lord. 
\v 31 Then the Priest shall burne the fatte vpon the Altar, and the breast shall be Aarons and his sonnes. 
\v 32 And the right shoulder shall ye giue vnto the Priest for an heaue offering, of your peace offrings. 
\v 33 The same that offreth the blood of ye peace offrings, and the fatte, among the sonnes of Aaron, shall haue the right shoulder for his parte. 
\v 34 For the breast shaken to and from, and the shoulder lifted vp, haue I taken of the children of Israel, euen of their peace offrings, and haue giuen them vnto Aaron the Priest and vnto his sonnes by a statute for euer from among the children of Israel. 
\v 35 This is the anointing of Aaron, and the anointing of his sonnes, concerning the offerings of the Lord made by fire, in the day when he presented them to serue in the Priestes office vnto the Lord. 
\v 36 The which portions the Lord commanded to giue them in the day that he anointed them from among the children of Israel, by a statute for euer in their generations. 
\v 37 This is also the lawe of the burnt offring of the meate offring, and of the sinne offring, and of the trespasse offring, and of the consecrations, and of the peace offrings, 
\v 38 Which the Lord commanded Moses in the mount Sinai, when he commanded the children of Israel to offer their giftes vnto the Lord in the wildernesse of Sinai. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1 Afterwarde the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Take Aaron and his sonnes with him, and the garments and the anointing oyle, and a bullocke for the sinne offring, and two rammes, and a basket of vnleauened bread, 
\v 3 And assemble all the company at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation. 
\v 4 So Moses did as the Lord had commanded him, and the companie was assembled at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation. 
\v 5 Then Moses said vnto the company, This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded to doe. 
\v 6 And Moses brought Aaron and his sonnes, and washed them with water, 
\v 7 And put vpon him the coate, and girded him with a girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the Ephod on him, which he girded with the broydred garde of the Ephod, and bounde it vnto him therewith. 
\v 8 After he put the brest plate thereon, and put in the breast plate the Vrim and the Thummim. 
\v 9 Also he put the miter vpon his head, and put vpon the miter on the fore front the golden plate, and the holy crowne, as the Lord had commanded Moses. 
\v 10 (Nowe Moses had taken the anointing oyle, and anoynted the Tabernacle, and al that was therein, and sanctified them, 
\v 11 And sprinkled thereof vpon the altar seuen times, and anointed the altar and all his instruments, and the lauer, and his foote, to sanctifie them) 
\v 12 And he powred of the anointing oyle vpon Aarons head, and anointed him, to sanctifie him. 
\v 13 After, Moses brought Aarons sonnes, and put coates vpon them, and girded them with girdles, and put bonets vpon their heades, as the Lord had commanded Moses. 
\v 14 Then he brought the bullocke for the sinne offring, and Aaron and his sonnes put their handes vpon the head of the bullocke for the sinne offring. 
\v 15 And Moses slew him, and tooke the blood, which he put vpon the hornes of the Altar roud about with his finger, and purified the altar, and powred the rest of the blood at the foote of ye altar: so he sanctified it, to make reconciliation vpon it. 
\v 16 Then he tooke all the fatte that was vpon the inwardes, and the kall of the liuer and the two kidneis, with their fat, which Moses burned vpon the Altar. 
\v 17 But the bullocke and his hide, and his flesh, and his doung, hee burnt with fire without the host as the Lord had commanded Moses. 
\v 18 Also hee brought the ram for the burnt offring, and Aaron and his sonnes put their hands vpon the head of the ramme. 
\v 19 So Moses killed it, and sprinkled the blood vpon the Altar round about, 
\v 20 And Moses cut the ram in pieces, and burnt the head with the pieces, and the fat, 
\v 21 And washed the inwardes and the legges in water: so Moses burnt the ram euery whit vpon ye Altar: for it was a burnt offring for a sweete sauour, which was made by fire vnto the Lord, as the Lord had commanded Moses. 
\v 22 After, he brought the other ram, the ram of consecrations, and Aaron and his sonnes layed their handes vpon the head of the ram, 
\v 23 Which Moses slewe, and tooke of the blood of it, and put it vpon the lappe of Aarons right eare, and vpon the thumbe of his right hand, and vpon the great toe of his right foote. 
\v 24 Then Moses brought Aarons sonnes, and put of the blood on the lap of their right eares, and vpon the thumbes of their right handes, and vpon the great toes of their right feete, and Moses sprinckled the rest of the blood vpon the Altar round about. 
\v 25 And he tooke the fat and the rumpe and all the fat that was vpon the inwards, and the kall of the liuer, and the two kidneis with their fat, and the right shoulder. 
\v 26 Also he tooke of ye basket of ye vnleauened bread that was before the Lord, one vnleauened cake and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and put them on the fat, and vpon the right shoulder. 
\v 27 So hee put all in Aarons handes, and in his sonnes handes, and shooke it to and from before the Lord. 
\v 28 After, Moses tooke the out of their hands, and burnt them vpon the altar for a burnt offring: for these were consecrations for a sweete sauour which were made by fire vnto the Lord. 
\v 29 Likewise Moses tooke the breast of the ram of consecrations, and shooke it to and from before the Lord: for it was Moses portion, as the Lord had commanded Moses. 
\v 30 Also Moses tooke of the anointing oyle, and of the blood which was vpon the Altar, and sprinkled it vpon Aaron, vpon his garments, and vpon his sonnes, and on his sonnes garments with him: so hee sanctified Aaron, his garments, and his sonnes, and his sonnes garments with him. 
\v 31 Afterward Moses saide vnto Aaron and his sonnes, Seethe the flesh at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and there eate it with the bread that is in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sonnes shall eate it, 
\v 32 But that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread, shall ye burne with fire. 
\v 33 And ye shall not depart from the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation seuen dayes, vntill the dayes of your consecrations bee at an ende: for seuen dayes, saide the Lord, shall hee consecrate you, 
\v 34 As hee hath done this day: so the Lord hath commanded to doe, to make an atonement for you. 
\v 35 Therefore shall yee abide at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation day and night, seuen dayes, and shall keepe the watch of the Lord, that ye dye not: for so I am commanded. 
\v 36 So Aaron and his sonnes did all thinges which the Lord had commanded by the hand of Moses. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 And in the eight day Moses called Aaron and his sonnes, and the Elders of Israel: 
\v 2 Then hee sayde vnto Aaron, Take thee a yong calfe for a sinne offring, and a ram for a burnt offring, both without blemish, and bring them before the Lord. 
\v 3 And vnto the children of Israel thou shalt speake, saying, Take yee an hee goate for a sinne offring, and a calfe, and a lambe, both of a yeere olde, without blemish for a burnt offring: 
\v 4 Also a bullock, and a ramme for peace offringes, to offer before the Lord, and a meate offring mingled with oyle: for to day the Lord will appeare vnto you. 
\v 5 Then they brought that which Moses commanded before the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and all the assembly drewe neere and stood before the Lord. 
\v 6 (For Moses had sayde, This is the thing, which the Lord commanded that ye should do, and the glory of the Lord shall appeare vnto you) 
\v 7 Then Moses sayd vnto Aaron, Draw neere to the Altar, and offer thy sinne offering, and thy burnt offring, and make an attonement for thee and for the people: offer also the offring of the people, and make an atonement for them, as the Lord hath commanded. 
\v 8 Aaron therefore went vnto the Altar, and killed the calfe of the sinne offring, which was for himselfe. 
\v 9 And the sonnes of Aaron brought ye blood vnto him, and he dipt his finger in the blood, and put it vpon the hornes of the Altar, and powred the rest of the blood at the foote of the Altar. 
\v 10 But the fat and the kidneis and the kall of the liuer of the sinne offring, he burnt vpon the Altar, as the Lord had commanded Moses. 
\v 11 The flesh also and the hide hee burnt with fire without the hoste. 
\v 12 After, he slewe the burnt offering, and Aarons sonnes brought vnto him the blood, which he sprinckled round about vpon the Altar. 
\v 13 Also they brought the burnt offring vnto him with the pieces thereof, and the head, and he burnt them vpon the Altar. 
\v 14 Likewise he did wash the inwardes and the legs, and burnt them vpon the burnt offring on the Altar. 
\v 15 Then he offred the peoples offring, and tooke a goate, which was the sinne offring for the people, and slewe it: and offred it for sinne, as the first: 
\v 16 So he offred the burnt offring, and prepared it, according to the maner. 
\v 17 He presented also the meate offring, and filled his hand thereof, and beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning he burnt this vpon the Altar. 
\v 18 He slewe also the bullock, and the ram for the peace offrings, that was for the people, and Arons sonnes brought vnto him the blood, which he sprinkled vpon the Altar round about, 
\v 19 With the fat of the bullocke, and of the ram, the rumpe, and that which couereth the inwards and the kidneis, and the kall of the liuer. 
\v 20 So they layed the fat vpon the breasts, and he burnt the fat vpon the Altar. 
\v 21 But the breastes and the right shoulder Aaron shooke to and from before the Lord, as the Lord had commanded Moses. 
\v 22 So Aaron lift vp his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and came downe from offring of the sinne offring, and the burnt offring, and the peace offrings. 
\v 23 After, Moses and Aaron went into the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and came out, and blessed the people, and the glorie of the Lord appeared to all the people. 
\v 24 And there came a fire out from the Lord and consumed vpon the Altar the burnt offring and the fatte: which when all the people sawe, they gaue thankes, and fell on their faces. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1 But Nadab and Abihu, the sonnes of Aaron, tooke either of them his censor, and put fire therein, and put incense thereupon, and offred strange fire before the Lord, which hee had not commanded them. 
\v 2 Therefore a fire went out from the Lord, and deuoured them: so they dyed before the Lord. 
\v 3 Then Moses sayde vnto Aaron, This is it that the Lord spake, saying, I will bee sanctified in the that come neere me, and before all the people I will be glorified: but Aaron held his peace. 
\v 4 And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan the sonnes of Vzziel, the vncle of Aaron, and saide vnto them, Come neere, cary your brethre from before the Sanctuarie out of the hoste. 
\v 5 Then they went, and caried them in their coates out of the host, as Moses had comaunded. 
\v 6 After, Moses saide vnto Aaron and vnto Eleazar and Ithamar his sonnes, Vncouer not your heads, neither rent your clothes, least ye dye, and least wrath come vpon all ye people: but let your brethren, all the house of Israel bewayle the burning which the Lord hath kindled. 
\v 7 And go not yee out from the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, least ye dye: for the anointing oyle of the Lord is vpon you: and they did according to Moses commandement. 
\v 8 And the Lord spake vnto Aaron, saying, 
\v 9 Thou shalt not drinke wine nor strong drinke, thou, nor thy sonnes with thee, when yee come into the Tabernacle of the Congregation, lest ye die: this is an ordinance for euer throughout your generations, 
\v 10 That ye may put difference betweene the holy and the vnholy, and betweene the cleane and the vncleane, 
\v 11 And that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the Lord hath commanded them by the hand of Moses. 
\v 12 Then Moses saide vnto Aaron and vnto Eleazar and to Ithamar his sonnes that were left, Take the meate offring that remaineth of the offrings of the Lord, made by fire, and eate it without leauen beside ye altar: for it is most holy: 
\v 13 And ye shall eate it in the holy place, because it is thy duetie and thy sonnes duety of the offringes of the Lord made by fire: for so I am commanded. 
\v 14 Also the shaken breast and the heaue shoulder shall yee eate in a cleane place: thou, and thy sonnes, and thy daughters with thee: for they are giuen as thy duetie and thy sonnes duety, of the peace offringes of the children of Israel. 
\v 15 The heaue shoulder, and the shaken breast shall they bring with the offringes made by fire of the fat, to shake it to and from before the Lord, and it shalbe thine and thy sonnes with thee by a lawe for euer, as the Lord hath commanded. 
\v 16 And Moses sought the goate that was offred for sinne, and lo, it was burnt: therefore he was angrie with Eleazar and Ithamar the sonnes of Aaron, which were left aliue, saying, 
\v 17 Wherfore haue ye not eaten the sinne offring in the holy place, seeing it is most Holie? and God hath giuen it you, to beare the iniquitie of the Congregation, to make an atonement for them before the Lord. 
\v 18 Beholde, the blood of it was not brought within the holy place: ye should haue eaten it in the holy place, as I commanded. 
\v 19 And Aaron said vnto Moses, Behold, this day haue they offred their sinne offring, and their burnt offring before the Lord, and such things as thou knowest are come vnto mee: If I had eaten the sinne offring to day, should it haue bene accepted in the sight of the Lord? 
\v 20 So when Moses heard it, he was content. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 After, the Lord spake vnto Moses and to Aaron, saying vnto them, 
\v 2 Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say, These are the beastes which yee shall eate, among all the beasts that are on the earth. 
\v 3 Whatsoeuer parteth the hoofe, and is clouen footed, and cheweth the cudde, among the beastes, that shall ye eate. 
\v 4 But of them that chewe the cud, or deuide the hoofe onely, of them yee shall not eate: as the camel, because he cheweth the cud, and deuideth not ye hoofe, he shall be vncleane vnto you. 
\v 5 Likewise the conie, because he cheweth the cud and deuideth not the hoofe, he shall bee vncleane to you. 
\v 6 Also the hare, because he cheweth the cud, and deuideth not the hoofe, he shalbe vncleane to you. 
\v 7 And the swine, because he parteth ye hoofe and is clouen footed, but cheweth not the cud, he shalbe vncleane to you. 
\v 8 Of their flesh shall yee not eate, and their carkeise shall yee not touch: for they shall bee vncleane to you. 
\v 9 These shall ye eate, of all that are in the waters: whatsoeuer hath finnes and skales in ye waters, in the seas, or in the riuers, them shall ye eate. 
\v 10 But all that haue not finnes nor skales in the seas, or in the riuers, of all that moueth in the waters, and of al liuing things that are in the waters, they shalbe an abomination vnto you. 
\v 11 They, I say, shalbe an abomination to you: ye shall not eate of their flesh, but shall abhorre their carkeis. 
\v 12 Whatsoeuer hath not fins nor skales in the waters, that shalbe abomination vnto you. 
\v 13 These shall ye haue also in abomination among the foules, they shall not be eaten: for they are an abomination, the eagle, and the goshauke, and the osprey: 
\v 14 Also the vultur, and the kite after his kinde, 
\v 15 And all rauens after their kinde: 
\v 16 The ostrich also, and the night crowe, and the seameaw, and the hauke after his kinde: 
\v 17 The litle owle also, and the connorant, and the great owle. 
\v 18 Also the redshanke and the pelicane, and the swanne: 
\v 19 The storke also, the heron after his kinde, and the lapwing, and the backe: 
\v 20 Also euery foule that creepeth and goeth vpon all foure, such shalbe an abomination vnto you. 
\v 21 Yet these shall ye eate: of euery foule that creepeth, and goeth vpon all foure which haue their feete and legs all of one to leape withal vpon the earth, 
\v 22 Of them ye shall eate these, the grashopper after his kinde, and the solean after his kinde, the hargol after his kinde, and the hagab after his kind. 
\v 23 But al other foules that creepe and haue foure feete, they shalbe abomination vnto you. 
\v 24 For by such ye shalbe polluted: whosoeuer toucheth their carkeis, shalbe vncleane vnto the euening. 
\v 25 Whosoeuer also beareth of their carkeis, shall wash his clothes, and be vncleane vntil euen. 
\v 26 Euery beast that hath clawes deuided, and is not clouen footed, nor cheweth the cud, such shalbe vncleane vnto you: euery one that toucheth them, shalbe vncleane. 
\v 27 And whatsoeuer goeth vpon his pawes among all maner beastes that goeth on all foure, such shalbe vncleane vnto you: who so doth touch their carkeis shalbe vncleane vntil the euen. 
\v 28 And he that beareth their carkeis, shall wash his clothes, and be vncleane vntill the euen: for such shalbe vncleane vnto you. 
\v 29 Also these shalbe vncleane to you amog the things that creepe and moue vpon the earth, the weasell, and the mouse, and the frog, after his kinde: 
\v 30 Also the rat, and the lizard, and the chameleon, and the stellio, and the molle. 
\v 31 These shall be vncleane to you among all that creepe: whosoeuer doeth touch them when they be dead, shalbe vncleane vntil the euen. 
\v 32 Also whatsoeuer any of the dead carkeises of them doth fall vpon, shalbe vncleane, whether it be vessel of wood, or rayment, or skinne, or sacke: whatsoeuer vessel it be that is occupied, it shalbe put in the water as vncleane vntil the euen, and so be purified. 
\v 33 But euery earthen vessel, whereinto any of them falleth, whatsoeuer is within it shalbe vncleane, and ye shall breake it. 
\v 34 Al meate also that shalbe eaten, if any such water come vpon it, shalbe vncleane: and all drinke that shalbe drunke in al such vessels shalbe vncleane. 
\v 35 And euery thing that their carkeis fall vpon, shalbe vncleane: the fornais or the pot shalbe broken: for they are vncleane, and shalbe vncleane vnto you. 
\v 36 Yet the fountaines and welles where there is plentie of water shalbe cleane: but that which toucheth their carkeises shalbe vncleane. 
\v 37 And if there fal of their dead carkeis vpon any seede, which vseth to be sowe, it shalbe cleane. 
\v 38 But if any water be powred vpon ye seede, and there fal of their dead carkeis thereon, it shall be vncleane vnto you. 
\v 39 If also any beast, whereof ye may eate, die, he that toucheth the carkeis thereof shall be vncleane vntil the euen. 
\v 40 And he that eateth of the carkeis of it, shall wash his clothes and be vncleane vntil the euen: he also that beareth the carkeis of it, shall wash his clothes, and be vncleane vntil the euen. 
\v 41 Euery creeping thing therefore that creepeth vpon the earth shalbe an abomination, and not be eaten. 
\v 42 Whatsoeuer goeth vpon the breast, and whatsoeuer goeth vpon al foure, or that hath many feete among all creeping thinges that creepe vpon the earth, ye shall not eate of them, for they shalbe abomination. 
\v 43 Ye shall not pollute your selues with any thing that creepeth, neither make your selues vncleane with them, neither defile your selues thereby: ye shall not, I say, be defiled by them, 
\v 44 For I am the Lord your God: be sanctified therefore, and be holy, for I am holy, and defile not your selues with any creeping thing, that creepeth vpon the earth. 
\v 45 For I am the Lord that brought you out of the lande of Egypt, to be your God, and that you should be holy, for I am holy. 
\v 46 This is the law of beasts, and of foules, and of euery liuing thing that moueth in the waters, and of euery thing that creepeth vpon the earth: 
\v 47 That there may be a difference betweene the vncleane and cleane, and betweene the beast that may be eaten, and the beast that ought not to be eaten. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say, When a woman hath brought forth seede, and borne a manchilde, shee shalbe vncleane seuen dayes, like as she is vncleane when she is put apart for her disease. 
\v 3 (And in the eight day, the foreskin of the childes flesh shalbe circumcised) 
\v 4 And she shall continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirtie dayes: she shall touch no halowed thing, nor come into the Sanctuarie, vntil the time of her purifying be out. 
\v 5 But if she beare a mayde childe, then shee shalbe vncleane two weekes, as when shee hath her disease: and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying three score and sixe dayes. 
\v 6 Nowe when the dayes of her purifying are out, (whether it be for a sonne or for a daughter) shee shall bring to the Priest a lambe of one yeere olde for a burnt offering, and a yong pigeon or a turtle doue for a sinne offring, vnto the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, 
\v 7 Who shall offer it before the Lord, and make an atonement for her: so she shalbe purged of the issue of her blood this is the law for her that hath borne a male or female. 
\v 8 But if she bee not able to bring a lambe, she shall bring two turtles, or two yong pigeons: the one for a burnt offring, and the other for a sinne offring: and the Priest shall make an atonement for her: so she shall be cleane. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 Moreouer the Lord spake vnto Moses, and to Aaron, saying, 
\v 2 The man that shall haue in the skin of his flesh a swelling or a skab, or a white spot, so that in the skinne of his flesh it be like the plague of leprosie, then he shalbe brought vnto Aaron the Priest, or vnto one of his sonnes the Priestes, 
\v 3 And the Priest shall looke on the sore in the skinne of his flesh: if the heare in the sore be turned into white, and the sore seeme to be lower then the skinne of his flesh, it is a plague of leprosie. therefore the Priest shall looke on him, and pronounce him vncleane: 
\v 4 But if the white spot be in the skinne of his flesh, and seeme not to bee lower then the skin, nor the heare thereof be turned vnto white, then the Priest shall shut vp him that hath the plague, seuen dayes. 
\v 5 After, the Priest shall looke vpon him the seuenth day: and if the plague seeme to him to abide still, and the plague growe not in the skin, the Priest shall shut him vp yet seuen dayes more. 
\v 6 Then the Priest shall looke on him againe the seuenth day, and if the plague be darke, and the sore grow not in the skinne, then the Priest shall pronounce him cleane, for it is a skab: therefore he shall washe his clothes and be cleane. 
\v 7 But if the skab growe more in the skinne, after that he is seene of ye Priest for to be purged, he shall be seene of the Priest yet againe. 
\v 8 Then the Priest shall consider, and if the skab growe in the skin, then the Priest shall pronounce him vncleane: for it is leprosie. 
\v 9 When the plague of leprosie is in a man, he shalbe brought vnto the Priest, 
\v 10 And the Priest shall see him: and if the swelling be white in ye skin, and haue made ye heare white, and there be rawe flesh in the swelling, 
\v 11 It is an old leprosie in the skin of his flesh: and the Priest shall pronounce him vncleane, and shall not shut him vp, for he is vncleane. 
\v 12 Also if the leprosie breake out in the skin, and the leprosie couer all the skin of the plague, from his head euen to his feete, wheresoeuer the Priest looketh, 
\v 13 Then the Priest shall consider: and if the leprosie couer all his flesh, he shall pronounce the plague to bee cleane, because it is all turned into whitenesse: so he shalbe cleane. 
\v 14 But if there be raw flesh on him when he is seene, he shalbe vncleane. 
\v 15 For the Priest shall see the rawe flesh, and declare him to be vncleane: for the rawe flesh is vncleane, therefore it is the leprosie. 
\v 16 Or if the rawe flesh change and be turned into white, then he shall come to the Priest, 
\v 17 And the Priest shall beholde him and if the sore be changed into white, then the Priest shall pronounce the plague cleane, for it is cleane. 
\v 18 The flesh also in whose skin there is a bile and is healed, 
\v 19 And in ye place of the bile there be a white swelling, or a white spot somewhat reddish, it shall be seene of the Priest. 
\v 20 And when the Priest seeth it, if it appeare lower then the skinne, and the heare thereof bee changed into white, ye Priest then shall pronounce him vncleane: for it is a plague of leprosie, broken out in the bile. 
\v 21 But if the Priest looke on it, and there be no white heares therein, and if it bee not lower then the skin, but be darker, then the Priest shall shut him vp seuen dayes. 
\v 22 And if it spred abroad in the flesh, ye Priest shall pronounce him vncleane, for it is a sore. 
\v 23 But if the spot continue in his place, and growe not, it is a burning bile: therefore the Priest shall declare him to be cleane. 
\v 24 If there be any flesh, in whose skin there is an hote burning, and the quick flesh of ye burning haue a white spot, somewhat reddish or pale, 
\v 25 Then the Priest shall looke vpon it: and if the heare in that spot be changed into white, and it appeare lower then the skin, it is a leprosie broken out in the burning therefore the Priest shall pronounce him vncleane: for it is the plague of leprosie. 
\v 26 But if the Priest looke on it, and there be no white heare in the spot, and be no lower then the other skinne, but be darker, then the Priest shall shut him vp seuen dayes. 
\v 27 After, the Priest shall looke on him the seuenth day: if it be growen abroad in the skinne, then the Priest shall pronounce him vncleane: for it is the plague of leprosie. 
\v 28 And if the spot abide in his place, not growing in the skin, but is darke, it is a rising of the burning: the Priest shall therefore declare him cleane, for it is the drying vp of the burning. 
\v 29 If also a man or woman hath a sore on the head or in the beard, 
\v 30 Then the Priest shall see his sore: and if it appeare lower then the skin, and there be in it a small yellow haire, then the Priest shall pronouce him vncleane: for it is a blacke spot, and leprosie of the head or of the beard. 
\v 31 And if the Priest looke on the sore of the blacke spotte, and if it seeme not lower then the skinne, nor haue any blacke heare in it, then the Priest shall shut vp him, that hath the sore of the blacke spot, seuen dayes. 
\v 32 After, in the seuenth day the Priest shall looke on the sore: and if the blacke spot growe not, and there be in it no yelowe heare, and the blacke spot seeme not lower then the skinne, 
\v 33 Then he shalbe shauen, but the place of the blacke spot shall he not shaue: but the Priest shall shut vp him, that hath the blacke spot, seuen dayes more. 
\v 34 And the seuenth day the Priest shall looke on the blacke spot: and if the blacke spot growe not in the skinne, nor seeme lower then the other skinne, then the Priest shall clense him, and hee shall wash his clothes, and be cleane. 
\v 35 But if the blacke spot growe abroad in the flesh after his clensing, 
\v 36 Then the Priest shall looke on it: and if the blacke spot grow in the skin, the Priest shall not seeke for the yelowe heare: for he is vncleane. 
\v 37 But if ye blacke spot seeme to him to abide, and that blacke heare growe therein, the blacke spot is healed, he is cleane, and the Priest shall declare him to be cleane. 
\v 38 Furthermore if there bee many white spots in the skin of the flesh of man or woman, 
\v 39 Then the Priest shall consider: and if the spots in the skin of their flesh be somewhat darke and white withall, it is but a white spot broken out in the skin: therefore he is cleane. 
\v 40 And the man whose heare is fallen off his head, and is balde, is cleane. 
\v 41 And if his head lose the heare on the forepart, and be balde before, he is cleane. 
\v 42 But if there be in the balde head, or in the balde forehead a white reddish sore, it is a leprosie springing in his balde head, or in his balde forehead. 
\v 43 Therefore the Priest shall looke vpon it, and if the rising of the sore bee white reddish in his balde head, or in his bald forehead, appearing like leprosie in the skin of the flesh, 
\v 44 He is a leper and vncleane: therefore the Priest shall pronounce him altogether vncleane: for the sore is in his head. 
\v 45 The leper also in whom the plague is, shall haue his clothes rent, and his head bare, and shall put a couering vpon his lips, and shall cry, I am vncleane, I am vncleane. 
\v 46 As long as the disease shall be vpon him, he shalbe polluted, for he is vncleane: he shall dwell alone, without the campe shall his habitation be. 
\v 47 Also the garment that the plague of leprosie is in, whether it be a wollen garment or a linen garment, 
\v 48 Whether it bee in the warpe or in ye woofe of linen or of wollen, either in a skin, or in any thing made of skin, 
\v 49 And if the sore be greene or somewhat reddish in the garment or in ye skin, or in the warpe, or in the woofe, or in any thing that is made of skin, it is a plague of leprosie and shalbe shewed vnto the Priest. 
\v 50 Then the Priest shall see the plague, and shut vp it that hath the plague, seuen dayes, 
\v 51 And shall looke on the plague the seuenth day: if the plague growe in the garment or in the warpe, or in the woofe, or in the skinne, or in any thing that is made of skin, that plague is a fretting leprosie and vncleane. 
\v 52 And hee shall burne the garment, or the warpe, or the woofe, whether it bee wollen or linen, or any thing that is made of skin, wherein the plague is: for it is a freating leprosie, therefore it shalbe burnt in the fire. 
\v 53 If the Priest yet see that the plague grow not in the garment, or in the woofe, or in whatsoeuer thing of skin it be, 
\v 54 Then the Priest shall commaund them to wash the thing wherein the plague is, and he shall shut it vp seuen dayes more. 
\v 55 Againe ye Priest shall looke on the plague, after it is washed: and if the plague haue not changed his colour, though the plague haue spred no further, it is vncleane: thou shalt burne it in the fire, for it is a fret inwarde, whether the spot bee in the bare place of the whole, or in part thereof. 
\v 56 And if the Priest see that the plague bee darker, after that it is washed, he shall cut it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warpe, or out of the woofe. 
\v 57 And if it appeare stil in ye garment or in the warpe, or in the woofe, or in any thing made of skin, it is a spreading leprie: thou shalt burne the thing wherein the plague is, in the fire. 
\v 58 If thou hast washed ye garment or ye warpe, or ye woofe, or whatsouer thing of skin it be, if the plague be departed therefrom, then shall it be washed the second time, and be cleane. 
\v 59 This is the lawe of the plague of leprosie in a garment of wollen or linnen, or in the warpe, or in the woofe, or in any thing of skin, to make it cleane or vncleane.

\v 1 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 This is the law of the leper in the day of his clensing: that is, he shall be brought vnto the Priest, 
\v 3 And the Priest shall go out of the campe, and the Priest shall consider him: and if the plague of leprosie be healed in the leper, 
\v 4 Then shall the Priest commaund to take for him that is clensed, two sparrowes aliue and cleane, and cedar wood and a skarlet lace, and hyssope. 
\v 5 And the Priest shall commaund to kill one of the birdes ouer pure water in an earthen vessell. 
\v 6 After, he shall take the liue sparowe with the cedar wood, and the skarlet lace, and the hyssope, and shall dip them and the liuing sparowe in the blood of the sparowe slaine, ouer the pure water, 
\v 7 And hee shall sprinkle vpon him, that must be clensed of his leprosie, seuen times, and clense him, and shall let goe the liue sparowe into the broad fielde. 
\v 8 Then he that shall be clensed, shall wash his clothes, and shaue off all his heare, and wash himselfe in water, so he shalbe cleane: after that shall he come into the host, but shall tary without his tent seuen dayes. 
\v 9 So in the seuenth day hee shall shaue off all his heare, both his head, and his beard, and his eye browes: euen all his heare shall he shaue, and shall wash his clothes and shall wash his flesh in water: so he shalbe cleane. 
\v 10 Then in the eight day he shall take two hee lambes without blemish, and an ewe lambe of a yere olde without blemish, and three tenth deales of fine flower for a meate offering, mingled with oyle, and a pint of oyle. 
\v 11 And the Priest that maketh him cleane shall bring the man which is to bee made cleane, and those things, before the Lord, at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation. 
\v 12 Then the Priest shall take one lambe, and offer him for a trespasse offering, and the pint of oyle, and shake the to and from before the Lord. 
\v 13 And hee shall kill the lambe in the place where the sinne offring and the burnt offring are slaine, euen in the holy place: for as the sinne offring is the Priests, so is the trespasse offring: for it is most holy. 
\v 14 So the Priest shall take of the blood of the trespasse offring, and put it vpon the lappe of the right eare of him that shalbe clensed, and vpon the thumbe of his right hand, and vpon the great toe of his right foote. 
\v 15 The Priest shall also take of ye pint of oyle, and powre it into the palme of his left hand, 
\v 16 And the Priest shall dip his right finger in the oyle that is in his left hand, and sprinkle of the oyle with his finger seuen times before the Lord. 
\v 17 And of the rest of the oyle that is in his hand, shall the Priest put vpon the lap of the right eare of him that is to bee clensed, and vpon the thumbe of his right hand, and vpon the great toe of his right foote, where the blood of the trespasse offring was put. 
\v 18 But the remnant of the oyle that is in the Priests hand, he shall powre vpon the head of him that is to be clensed: so the Priest shall make an atonement for him before the Lord. 
\v 19 And the Priest shall offer the sinne offring and make an atonement for him that is to bee clensed of his vncleannesse: then after shall he kill the burnt offring. 
\v 20 So the Priest shall offer ye burnt offring and the meat offring vpon ye altar and the Priest shall make an atonement for him: so he shalbe cleane. 
\v 21 But if he be poore, and not able, then he shall bring one lambe for a trespasse offring to be shaken, for his reconciliation, and a tenth deale of fine flower mingled with oyle, for a meate offring, with a pinte of oyle. 
\v 22 Also two turtle doues, or two yong pigeons, as he is able, whereof the one shalbe a sinne offering, and the other a burnt offring, 
\v 23 And he shall bring them the eight day for his clensing vnto the Priest at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation before ye Lord. 
\v 24 The the Priest shall take the lambe of the trespasse offring, and the pint of oyle, and the Priest shall shake them to and from before the Lord. 
\v 25 And he shall kill the lambe of the trespasse offering, and the Priest shall take of the blood of the trespasse offring, and put it vpon the lap of his right eare that is to be clensed, and vpon ye thumbe of his right hande, and vpon the great toe of his right foote. 
\v 26 Also the Priest shall powre of the oyle into the palme of his owne left hand. 
\v 27 So ye Priest shall with his right finger sprinkle of the oyle that is in his left hand, seuen times before the Lord. 
\v 28 Then the Priest shall put of the oyle that is in his hande, vpon the lap of the right eare of him that is to bee clensed, and vpon the thumbe of his right hande, and vpon the great toe of his right foote: vpon the place of the blood of the trespasse offring. 
\v 29 But ye rest of the oyle that is in the Priests hand, he shall put vpon the head of him that is to be clensed, to make an atonement for him before the Lord. 
\v 30 Also hee shall present one of the turtle doues, or of the yong pigeons, as he is able: 
\v 31 Such, I say, as he is able, the one for a sinne offring, and the other for a burnt offring with the meate offring: so the Priest shall make an atonement for him that is to bee clensed before the Lord. 
\v 32 This is the lawe of him which hath the plague of leprosie, who is not able in his clensing to offer the whole. 
\v 33 The Lord also spake vnto Moses and to Aaron, saying, 
\v 34 When ye be come vnto the land of Canaan which I giue you in possession, if I sende the plague of leprosie in an house of the land of your possession, 
\v 35 Then he that oweth the house, shall come and tell the Priest, saying, Me thinke there is like a plague of leprosie in the house. 
\v 36 Then the Priest shall commande them to emptie the house before the Priest goe into it to see the plague, that all that is in the house be not made vncleane, and then shall the Priest goe in to see the house, 
\v 37 And hee shall marke the plague: and if the plague be in the walles of the house, and that there be deepe spots, greenish or reddish, which seeme to be lower then the wall, 
\v 38 Then the Priest shall goe out of the house to the doore of the house, and shall cause to shut vp the house seuen dayes. 
\v 39 So the Priest shall come againe ye seuenth day: and if he see that the plague bee increased in the walles of the house, 
\v 40 Then the Priest shall commande them to take away the stones wherein the plague is, and they shall cast them into a foule place without the citie. 
\v 41 Also hee shall cause to scrape the house within rounde about, and powre the dust, that they haue pared off, without the citie in an vncleane place. 
\v 42 And they shall take other stones, and put them in the places of those stones, and shall take other mortar, to plaister the house with. 
\v 43 But if the plague come againe and breake out in the house, after that he hath taken away ye stones, and after that hee hath scraped and playstered the house, 
\v 44 Then the Priest shall come and see: and if the plague growe in the house, it is a freating leprosie in the house: it is therefore vncleane. 
\v 45 And hee shall breake downe the house, with the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the mortar of the house, and hee shall carie them out of the citie vnto an vncleane place. 
\v 46 Moreouer he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut vp, hee shall bee vncleane vntill the euen. 
\v 47 Hee also that sleepeth in the house shall wash his clothes: he likewise that eateth in the house, shall wash his clothes. 
\v 48 But if the Priest shall come and see, that the plague hath spread no further in the house, after the house be plaistered, the Priest shall pronounce that house cleane, for the plague is healed. 
\v 49 Then shall he take to purifie the house, two sparrowes, and cedar wood, and skarlet lace, and hyssope. 
\v 50 And hee shall kill one sparowe ouer pure water in an earthen vessell, 
\v 51 And shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssope, and the skarlet lace with the liue Sparrow, and dip them in the blood of the slayne Sparrow, and in the pure water, and sprinkle the house seuen times: 
\v 52 So shall hee clense the house with ye blood of the sparowe, and with the pure water, and with the liue sparowe, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssope, and with the skarlet lace. 
\v 53 Afterwarde he shall let go the liue sparowe out of the towne into the broad fieldes: so shall he make atonement for the house, and it shall be cleane. 
\v 54 This is the law for euery plague of leprosie and blacke spot, 
\v 55 And of the leprosie of the garment, and of the house, 
\v 56 And of the swelling, and of the skab, and of the white spot. 
\v 57 This is the lawe of the leprosie to teache when a thing is vncleane, and when it is cleane. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1 Moreouer the Lord spake vnto Moses, and to Aaron, saying, 
\v 2 Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say vnto them, Whosoeuer hath an issue from his flesh, is vncleane, because of his issue. 
\v 3 And this shalbe his vncleannes in his issue: when his flesh auoydeth his issue, or if his flesh be stopped from his issue, this is his vncleannes. 
\v 4 Euery bed whereon he lyeth that hath the issue, shall be vncleane, and euery thing whereon he sitteth, shalbe vncleane. 
\v 5 Whosoeuer also toucheth his bed, shall wash his clothes, and wash himselfe in water, and shall be vncleane vntill the euen. 
\v 6 And he that sitteth on any thing, whereon he sate that hath the issue, shall wash his clothes, and wash himselfe in water, and shalbe vncleane vntill the euen. 
\v 7 Also he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue, shall wash his clothes, and wash himselfe in water, and shalbe vncleane vntil the euen. 
\v 8 If he also, that hath the issue, spit vpon him that is cleane, he shall wash his clothes, and wash himselfe in water, and shalbe vncleane vntill the euen. 
\v 9 And what saddle soeuer he rideth vpon, that hath the issue, shalbe vncleane, 
\v 10 And whosoeuer toucheth any thing that was vnder him, shall be vncleane vnto the euen: and he that beareth those things, shall wash his clothes, and wash himselfe in water, and shall be vncleane vntill the euen. 
\v 11 Likewise whomesoeuer hee toucheth that hath the issue (and hath not washed his handes in water) shall wash his clothes and wash himselfe in water, and shalbe vncleane vntill the euen. 
\v 12 And the vessel of earth that he toucheth, which hath the issue, shalbe broken: and euery vessel of wood shalbe rinsed in water. 
\v 13 But if he that hath an issue, be cleansed of his issue, then shall he count him seuen dayes for his cleansing, and wash his clothes, and wash his flesh in pure water: so shall he be cleane. 
\v 14 Then the eight day he shall take vnto him two Turtle doues or two yong pigeons, and come before the Lord at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and shall giue them vnto the Priest. 
\v 15 And the Priest shall make of the one of them a sinne offring, and of the other a burnt offering: so the Priest shall make an atonement for him before the Lord, for his issue. 
\v 16 Also if any mans issue of seede depart from him, he shall wash all his flesh in water, and be vncleane vntill the euen. 
\v 17 And euery garment, and euery skinne whereupon shalbe issue of seede, shall be euen washed with water, and be vncleane vnto the euen. 
\v 18 If he that hath an issue of seede, do lie with a woman, they shall both wash themselues with water, and be vncleane vntill the euen. 
\v 19 Also when a woman shall haue an issue, and her issue in her flesh shalbe blood, she shalbe put apart seuen dayes: and whosoeuer toucheth her, shalbe vncleane vnto the euen. 
\v 20 And whatsoeuer she lieth vpon in her separation, shalbe vncleane, and euery thing that she sitteth vpon, shalbe vncleane. 
\v 21 Whosoeuer also toucheth her bedde, shall wash his clothes, and wash himselfe with water, and shalbe vncleane vnto the euen. 
\v 22 And whosoeuer toucheth any thing that she sate vpon, shall wash his clothes, and wash him selfe in water, and shalbe vncleane vnto the euen: 
\v 23 So that whether he touche her bed, or any thing whereon shee hath sit, he shalbe vncleane vnto the euen. 
\v 24 And if a man lye with her, and the flowers of her separation touch him, he shalbe vncleane seuen dayes, and all the whole bed whereon he lieth, shalbe vncleane. 
\v 25 Also when a womans issue of blood runneth long time besides the time of her floures, or when she hath an issue, longer then her floures, all the dayes of the issue of her vncleannesse shee shalbe vncleane, as in the time of her floures. 
\v 26 Euery bed whereon shee lyeth (as long as her issue lasteth) shalbe to her as her bed of her separation: and whatsoeuer she sitteth vpon, shalbe vncleane, as her vncleannes whe she is put apart. 
\v 27 And whosoeuer toucheth these things, shall be vncleane, and shall wash his clothes, and wash him selfe in water, and shalbe vncleane vnto the euen. 
\v 28 But if she be clensed of her issue, then shee shall count her seuen dayes, and after, shee shall be cleane. 
\v 29 And in the eight day shee shall take vnto her two Turtles or two yong pigeons, and bring them vnto the Priest at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation. 
\v 30 And the Priest shall make of ye one a sinne offring, and of the other a burnt offring, and the Priest shall make an atonement for her before the Lord, for the issue of her vncleannes. 
\v 31 Thus shall yee separate the children of Israel from their vncleannes, that they dye not in their vncleannesse, if they defile my Tabernacle that is among them. 
\v 32 This is the lawe of him that hath an issue, and of him from whome goeth an issue of seede whereby he is defiled: 
\v 33 Also of her that is sicke of her floures, and of him that hath a running issue, whether it bee man or woman, and of him that lyeth with her which is vncleane.

\p
\v 1 Fvrthermore the Lord spake vnto Moses, after the death of the two sonnes of Aaron, whe they came to offer before the Lord, and dyed: 
\v 2 And the Lord sayd vnto Moses, Speake vnto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all times into the Holy place within the vayle, before the Merciseate, which is vpon the Arke, that he dye not: for I wil appeare in the cloude vpon the Merciseate. 
\v 3 After this sort shall Aaron come into the Holy place: euen with a yong bullocke for a sinne offring, and a ramme for a burnt offring. 
\v 4 He shall put on the holy linnen coate, and shall haue linnen breeches vpon his flesh, and shall be girded with a linnen girdle, and shall couer his head with a linnen miter: these are the holy garments: therefore shall hee wash his flesh in water, when he doeth put them on. 
\v 5 And hee shall take of the Congregation of the children of Israel, two hee goates for a sinne offring, and a ramme for a burnt offring. 
\v 6 Then Aaron shall offer the bullocke for his sinne offring, and make an atonement for himselfe, and for his house. 
\v 7 And he shall take the two hee goates, and present them before the Lord at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation. 
\v 8 Then Aaron shall cast lots ouer the two hee goates: one lot for the Lord, and the other for the Scape goate. 
\v 9 And Aaron shall offer the goat, vpon which the Lords lot shall fal, and make him a sinne offring. 
\v 10 But the goate, on which the lot shall fall to be the Scape goate, shalbe presented aliue before the Lord, to make reconciliation by him, and to let him go (as a Scape goate) into the wildernes. 
\v 11 Thus Aaron shall offer the bullocke for his sinne offring, and make a reconciliation for himselfe, and for his house, and shall kill the bullocke for his sinne offring. 
\v 12 And he shall take a censer full of burning coles from off the altar before the Lord, and his handfull of sweete incense beaten small, and bring it within the vayle, 
\v 13 And shall put the incense vpon the fire before the Lord, that the cloude of the incense may couer the Merciseat that is vpon the Testimonie: so he shall not dye. 
\v 14 And hee shall take of the blood of the bullocke, and sprinkle it with his finger vpon the Merciseat Eastward: and before the Merciseate shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seuen times. 
\v 15 Then shall he kill the goate that is the peoples sinne offring, and bring his blood within the vaile, and doe with that blood, as he did with the blood of the bullocke, and sprinckle it vpon the Merciseate, and before the Merciseate. 
\v 16 So he shall purge the Holy place from the vncleannes of the children of Israel, and from their trespasses of all their sinnes: so shall he do also for the Tabernacle of the Cogregation placed with them, in the middes of their vncleannesse. 
\v 17 And there shalbe no man in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, when he goeth in to make an atonement in the Holy place, vntill hee come out, and haue made an atonement for himselfe, and for his housholde, and for all the Congregation of Israel. 
\v 18 After, he shall goe out vnto the altar that is before the Lord and make a reconciliation vpon it, and shall take of the blood of the bullocke, and of the blood of the goate, and put it vpon the hornes of the Altar round about: 
\v 19 So shall hee sprinkle of the blood vpon it with his finger seuen times, and clense it, and halowe it from the vncleannes of the children of Israel. 
\v 20 When he hath made an ende of purging the Holy place, and the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and the altar, then he shall bring the liue goate: 
\v 21 And Aaron shall put both his handes vpon the head of the liue goate, and confesse ouer him al the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their trespasses, in all their sinnes, putting them vpon the head of the goate, and shall sende him away (by the hand of a man appointed) into the wildernes. 
\v 22 So the goate shall beare vpon him all their iniquities into the land that is not inhabited, and he shall let the goate go into the wildernesse. 
\v 23 After, Aaron shall come into the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and put off the linnen clothes, which he put on when he went into the Holy place, and leaue them there. 
\v 24 Hee shall wash also his flesh with water in the Holy place, and put on his owne rayment, and come out, and make his burnt offring, and the burnt offring of the people, and make an atonement for himselfe, and for the people. 
\v 25 Also the fatte of the sinne offring shall he burne vpon the altar. 
\v 26 And he that caried forth the goat, called the Scape goat, shall wash his clothes, and wash his flesh in water, and after that shall come into the hoste. 
\v 27 Also the bullocke for the sinne offring, and the goate for the sinne offring (whose blood was brought to make a reconciliation in the Holy place) shall one carie out without the hoste to be burnt in the fire, with their skinnes, and with their flesh, and with their doung. 
\v 28 And hee that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and wash his flesh in water, and afterward come into the hoste. 
\v 29 So this shalbe an ordinance for euer vnto you: the tenth day of the seuenth moneth, yee shall humble your soules, and do no worke at all, whether it be one of the same countrey or a strager that soiourneth among you. 
\v 30 For that day shall ye Priest make an atonement for you to clense you: ye shalbe cleane from all your sinnes before the Lord. 
\v 31 This shall be a Sabbath of rest vnto you, and ye shall humble your soules, by an ordinance for euer. 
\v 32 And the Priest whom he shall anoynt, and whom he shall cosecrate (to minister in his fathers steade) shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linnen clothes and Holy vestments, 
\v 33 And shall purge the Holy Sanctuarie and the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and shall clense the altar, and make an atonement for the Priests and for all the people of the Congregation. 
\v 34 And this shalbe an euerlasting ordinance vnto you, to make an atonement for the children of Israel for all their sinnes once a yeere: and as the Lord commanded Moses, he did. 
\c 17  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Speake vnto Aaron, and to his sonnes, and to all the children of Israel, and say vnto them, This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded, saying, 
\v 3 Whosoeuer he be of the house of Israel that killeth a bullocke, or lambe, or goate in the hoste, or that killeth it out of the hoste, 
\v 4 And bringeth it not vnto the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation to offer an offring vnto the Lord before the Tabernacle of the Lord, blood shalbe imputed vnto that man: he hath shed blood, wherefore that man shall be cut off from among his people. 
\v 5 Therefore the children of Israel shall bring their offrings, which they would offer abroad in the fielde, and present the vnto ye Lord at the doore of the Tabernacle of ye Congregation by ye Priest, and offer them for peace offrings vnto the Lord. 
\v 6 Then the Priest shall sprinkle the blood vpon the Altar of the Lord before the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and burne the fat for a sweete sauour vnto the Lord. 
\v 7 And they shall no more offer their offerings vnto deuils, after whom they haue gone a whoring: this shalbe an ordinance for euer vnto them in their generations. 
\v 8 Also thou shalt say vnto them, whosoeuer he be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers which soiourne among them, that offreth a burnt offring or sacrifice, 
\v 9 And bringeth it not vnto ye doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation to offer it vnto the Lord, euen that man shall be cut off from his people. 
\v 10 Likewise whosoeuer he be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that soiourne among them, that eateth any blood, I will euen set my face against that person that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people. 
\v 11 For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I haue giuen it vnto you to offer vpon the altar, to make an atonement for your soules: for this blood shall make an atonement for the soule. 
\v 12 Therefore I saide vnto ye children of Israel, None of you shall eate blood: neither the stranger that soiourneth among you, shall eate blood. 
\v 13 Moreouer whosoeuer he be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that soiourne among the, which by hunting taketh any beast or foule that may be eaten, he shall powre out the blood thereof, and couer it with dust: 
\v 14 For ye life of all flesh is his blood, it is ioyned with his life: therefore I sayd vnto the children of Israel, Ye shall eate the blood of no flesh: for the life of al flesh is the blood thereof: whosoeuer eateth it, shalbe cut off. 
\v 15 And euery person that eateth it which dyeth alone, or that which is torne with beastes, whether it be one of the same countrey or a stranger, he shall both wash his clothes, and wash himselfe in water, and be vncleane vnto the euen: after he shalbe cleane. 
\v 16 But if he wash them not, nor wash his flesh, then he shall beare his iniquitie. 
\c 18  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say vnto them, I am the Lord your God. 
\v 3 After ye doings of the land of Egypt, wherin ye dwelt, shall ye not doe: and after the maner of the land of Canaan, whither I will bring you, shall ye not do, neither walke in their ordinances, 
\v 4 But do after my iudgements, and keepe mine ordinances, to walke therein: I am the Lord your God. 
\v 5 Ye shall keepe therefore my statutes, and my iudgements, which if a man doe, he shall then liue in them: I am the Lord. 
\v 6 None shall come neere to any of ye kinred of his flesh to vncouer her shame: I am the Lord. 
\v 7 Thou shalt not vncouer the shame of thy father, nor the shame of thy mother: for she is thy mother, thou shalt not discouer her shame. 
\v 8 The shame of thy fathers wife shalt thou not discouer: for it is thy fathers shame. 
\v 9 Thou shalt not discouer the shame of thy sister the daughter of thy father, or the daughter of thy mother, whether shee bee borne at home, or borne without: thou shalt not discouer their shame. 
\v 10 The shame of thy sonnes daughter, or of thy daughters daughter, thou shalt not, I say, vncouer their shame: for it is thy shame. 
\v 11 The shame of thy fathers wiues daughter, begotten of thy father (for she is thy sister) thou shalt not, I say, discouer her shame. 
\v 12 Thou shalt not vncouer the shame of thy fathers sister: for she is thy fathers kinswoman. 
\v 13 Thou shalt not discouer the shame of thy mothers sister: for she is thy mothers kinsewoman. 
\v 14 Thou shalt not vncouer the shame of thy fathers brother: that is, thou shalt not goe in to his wife, for she is thine aunte. 
\v 15 Thou shalt not discouer the shame of thy daughter in lawe: for she is thy sonnes wife: therefore shalt thou not vncouer her shame. 
\v 16 Thou shalt not discouer the shame of thy brothers wife. for it is thy brothers shame. 
\v 17 Thou shalt not discouer the shame of the wife and of her daughter, neither shalt thou take her sonnes daughter, nor her daughters daughter, to vncouer her shame: for they are thy kinsfolkes, and it were wickednesse. 
\v 18 Also thou shalt not take a wife with her sister, during her life, to vexe her, in vncouering her shame vpon her. 
\v 19 Thou shalt not also go vnto a woman to vncouer her shame, as long as she is put apart for her disease. 
\v 20 Moreouer, thou shalt not giue thy selfe to thy neighbours wife by carnall copulation, to be defiled with her. 
\v 21 Also thou shalt not giue thy children to offer them vnto Molech, neither shalt thou defile the name of thy God: for I am the Lord. 
\v 22 Thou shalt not lie with ye male as one lieth with a woman: for it is abomination. 
\v 23 Thou shalt not also lie with any beast to bee defiled therewith, neither shall any woman stand before a beast, to lie downe thereto: for it is abomination. 
\v 24 Yee shall not defile your selues in any of these things: for in al these the nations are defiled, which I will cast out before you: 
\v 25 And the land is defiled: therefore I wil visit the wickednesse thereof vpon it, and the lande shall vomit out her inhabitants. 
\v 26 Ye shall keepe therefore mine ordinances, and my iudgements, and commit none of these abominations, aswell hee that is of the same countrey, as the straunger that soiourneth among you. 
\v 27 (For all these abominations haue the men of the land done, which were before you, and the land is defiled: 
\v 28 And shall not the lande spue you out if ye defile it, as it spued out the people that were before you?) 
\v 29 For whosoeuer shall commit any of these abominations, the persons that doe so, shall bee cut off from among their people. 
\v 30 Therefore shall yee keepe mine ordinances that ye do not any of the abominable customes, which haue bene done before you, and that yee defile not your selues therein: for I am the Lord your God. 
\c 19  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Speake vnto all the Congregation of the children of Israel, and say vnto them, Ye shalbe holy, for I the Lord your God am holy. 
\v 3 Yee shall feare euery man his mother and his father, and shall keepe my Sabbaths: for I am the Lord your God. 
\v 4 Ye shall not turne vnto idoles, nor make you molten gods: I am the Lord your God. 
\v 5 And when yee shall offer a peace offering vnto the Lord, ye shall offer it freely. 
\v 6 It shall be eaten the day yee offer it, or on the morowe: and that which remaineth vntill the third day, shalbe burnt in the fire. 
\v 7 For if it be eaten the third day, it shall be vncleane, it shall not be accepted. 
\v 8 Therefore he that eateth it, shall beare his iniquitie, because he hath defiled the halowed thing of the Lord, and that person shalbe cut off from his people. 
\v 9 When yee reape the haruest of your land, ye shall not reape euery corner of your field, neither shalt thou gather the glainings of thy haruest. 
\v 10 Thou shalt not gather the grapes of thy vineyarde cleane, neyther gather euery grape of thy vineyarde, but thou shalt leaue them for the poore and for the straunger: I am the Lord your God. 
\v 11 Ye shall not steale, neither deale falsely, neither lie one to another. 
\v 12 Also yee shall not sweare by my name falsely, neither shalt thou defile the name of thy God: I am the Lord. 
\v 13 Thou shalt not do thy neighbour wrong, neither rob him. The workemans hire shall not abide with thee vntil the morning. 
\v 14 Thou shalt not curse the deafe, neither put a stumbling blocke before the blinde, but shalt feare thy God: I am the Lord. 
\v 15 Ye shall not doe vniustly in iudgement. Thou shalt not fauour the person of the poore, nor honour the person of the mightie, but thou shalt iudge thy neighbour iustly. 
\v 16 Thou shalt not walke about with tales among thy people. Thou shalt not stand against the blood of thy neighbour: I am the Lord. 
\v 17 Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart, but thou shalt plainely rebuke thy neighbour, and suffer him not to sinne. 
\v 18 Thou shalt not auenge, nor be mindful of wrong against ye childre of thy people, but shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe: I am the Lord. 
\v 19 Yee shall keepe mine ordinances. Thou shalt not let thy cattel gender with others of diuers kindes. Thou shalt not sowe thy fielde with mingled seede, neyther shall a garment of diuers thinges, as of linen and wollen come vpon thee. 
\v 20 Whosoeuer also lyeth and medleth with a woman that is a bonde mayde, affianced to a husband, and not redeemed, nor freedome giuen her, she shalbe scourged, but they shall not die, because she is not made free. 
\v 21 And he shall bring for his trespasse offring vnto the Lord, at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, a ramme for a trespasse offering. 
\v 22 Then the Priest shall make an atonement for him with the ramme of the trespasse offering before the Lord, concerning his sinne which he hath done, and pardon shalbe giuen him for his sinne which he hath committed. 
\v 23 Also when ye shall come into the land, and haue planted euery tree for meate, ye shall count the fruite thereof as vncircumcised: three yeere shall it be vncircumcised vnto you, it shall not be eaten: 
\v 24 But in the fourth yere all the fruite thereof shalbe holy to the praise of the Lord. 
\v 25 And in the fifth yeere shall ye eate of the fruite of it that it may yeelde to you the encrease thereof: I am the Lord your God. 
\v 26 Ye shall not eat the flesh with the blood, ye shall not vse witchcraft, nor obserue times. 
\v 27 Ye shall not cut rounde the corners of your heades, neither shalt thou marre the tuftes of thy beard. 
\v 28 Ye shall not cut your flesh for the dead, nor make any print of a marke vpon you: I am the Lord, 
\v 29 Thou shalt not make thy daughter common, to cause her to be a whore, least the lande also fall to whoredome, and the lande bee full of wickednesse. 
\v 30 Ye shall keepe my Sabbaths and reuerence my Sanctuarie: I am the Lord. 
\v 31 Ye shall not regarde them that worke with spirites, neither soothsayers: ye shall not seeke to them to be defiled by them: I am the Lord your God. 
\v 32 Thou shalt rise vp before the horehead, and honour the person of the old man, and dread thy God: I am the Lord. 
\v 33 And if a stranger soiourne with thee in your lande, ye shall not vexe him. 
\v 34 But the stranger that dwelleth with you, shalbe as one of your selues, and thou shalt loue him as thy selfe: for ye were strangers in the lad of Egypt: I am the Lord your God. 
\v 35 Ye shall not doe vniustly in iudgement, in line, in weight, or in measure. 
\v 36 You shall haue iust ballances, true weightes, a true Ephah, and a true Hin. I am the Lord your God, which haue brought you out of the lande of Egypt. 
\v 37 Therefore shall ye obserue all mine ordinances, and all my iudgements, and doe them: I am the Lord. 
\c 20  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Thou shalt say also to the children of Israel, Whosoeuer he be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that dwell in Israel, that giueth his children vnto Molech, he shall die the death, ye people of ye land shall stone him to death. 
\v 3 And I will set my face against that man and cut him off from among his people, because he hath giuen his children vnto Molech, for to defile my Sanctuarie, and to pollute mine holy Name. 
\v 4 And if the people of the lande hide their eyes, and winke at that man when he giueth his children vnto Molech, and kill him not, 
\v 5 Then will I set my face against that man, and against his familie, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him to comit whoredome with Molech, from among their people. 
\v 6 If any turne after such as worke with spirits, and after soothsayers, to go a whoring after them, then will I set my face against that person, and will cut him off from among his people. 
\v 7 Sanctifie your selues therefore, and be holie, for I am the Lord your God. 
\v 8 Keepe ye therefore mine ordinances, and doe them. I am the Lord which doeth sanctifie you. 
\v 9 If there be any that curseth his father or his mother, he shall die the death: seeing hee hath cursed his father and his mother, his blood shalbe vpon him. 
\v 10 And the man that committeth adulterie with another mans wife, because he hath comitted adulterie with his neighbours wife, the adulterer and the adulteresse shall die the death. 
\v 11 And the man that lyeth with his fathers wife, because hee hath vncouered his fathers shame, they shall both dye: their blood shalbe vpon them. 
\v 12 Also the man that lyeth with his daughter in lawe, they both shall dye the death, they haue wrought abomination, their blood shalbe vpon them. 
\v 13 The man also that lyeth with the male, as one lyeth with a woman, they haue both committed abomination: they shall dye the death, their blood shalbe vpon them. 
\v 14 Likewise he that taketh a wife and her mother, committeth wickednesse: they shall burne him and them with fire, that there be no wickednes among you. 
\v 15 Also the man that lyeth with a beast, shall dye the death, and ye shall slay the beast. 
\v 16 And if a woman come to any beast, and lye therewith, then thou shalt kill the woman and the beast: they shall die the death, their blood shalbe vpon them. 
\v 17 Also the man that taketh his sister, his fathers daughter, or his mothers daughter, and seeth her shame and she seeth his shame, it is villenie: therefore they shall be cut off in the sight of their people, because he hath vncouered his sisters shame, he shall beare his iniquitie. 
\v 18 The man also that lyeth with a woman hauing her disease, and vncouereth her shame, and openeth her fountaine, and she open the foutaine of her blood, they shall bee euen both cut off from among their people. 
\v 19 Moreouer thou shalt not vncouer the shame of thy mothers sister, nor of thy fathers sister: because he hath vncouered his kin, they shall beare their iniquitie. 
\v 20 Likewise the man that lyeth with his fathers brothers wife, and vncouereth his vncles shame: they shall beare their iniquitie, and shall die childlesse. 
\v 21 So the man that taketh his brothers wife, committeth filthines, because he hath vncouered his brothers shame: they shalbe childles. 
\v 22 Ye shall keepe therefore all mine ordinances and all my iudgements, and doe them, that the land, whither I bring you to dwel therein, spue you not out. 
\v 23 Wherefore ye shall not walke in the maners of this nation which I cast out before you: for they haue committed all these things, therefore I abhorred them. 
\v 24 But I haue saide vnto you, ye shall inherite their land, and I will giue it vnto you to possesse it, euen a land that floweth with milke and honie: I am the Lord your God, which haue separated you from other people. 
\v 25 Therefore shall ye put difference betweene cleane beastes and vncleane, and betweene vncleane foules and cleane: neither shall ye defile your selues with beastes and foules, nor with any creeping thing, that ye ground bringeth forth, which I haue separated from you as vncleane. 
\v 26 Therefore shall ye be holie vnto me: for I the Lord am holy, and I haue separated you from other people, that ye shoulde be mine. 
\v 27 And if a man or woman haue a spirite of diuination, or soothsaying in them, they shall die the death: they shall stone them to death, their blood shalbe vpon them. 
\c 21  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord said vnto Moses, Speake vnto the Priestes the sonnes of Aaron, and say vnto them, Let none be defiled by the dead among his people, 
\v 2 But by his kinseman that is neere vnto him: to wit, by his mother, or by his father, or by his sonne, or by his daughter, or by his brother, 
\v 3 Or by his sister a maid, that is neere vnto him, which hath not had a husband: for her he may lament. 
\v 4 He shall not lament for the Prince among his people, to pollute him selfe. 
\v 5 They shall not make balde partes vpon their head, nor shaue off the locks of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh. 
\v 6 They shalbe holy vnto their God, and not pollute the name of their God: for the sacrifices of the Lord made by fire, and the bread of their God they doe offer: therefore they shalbe holie. 
\v 7 They shall not take to wife an whore, or one polluted, neither shall they marrie a woman diuorced from her husband: for such one is holy vnto his God. 
\v 8 Thou shalt sanctifie him therefore, for he offereth the bread of thy God: he shall be holy vnto thee: for I the Lord, which sanctifie you, am holy. 
\v 9 If a Priestes daughter fall to play the whore, she polluteth her father: therefore shall she be burnt with fire. 
\v 10 Also ye hie Priest among his brethren, (vpon whose head the anointing oyle was powred, and hath consecrated his hand to put on the garments) shall not vncouer his head, nor rent his clothes, 
\v 11 Neither shall he goe to any dead bodie, nor make him selfe vncleane by his father or by his mother, 
\v 12 Neither shall he goe out of the Sanctuarie, nor pollute the holy place of his God: for the crowne of the anoynting oyle of his God is vpon him: I am the Lord. 
\v 13 Also he shall take a maide vnto his wife: 
\v 14 But a widowe, or a diuorced woman, or a polluted, or an harlot, these shall he not marrie, but shall take a maide of his owne people to wife: 
\v 15 Neyther shall he defile his seede among his people: for I am the Lord which sanctifie him. 
\v 16 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 17 Speake vnto Aaron, and say, Whosoeuer of thy seede in their generations hath any blemishes, shall not prease to offer the bread of his God: 
\v 18 For whosoeuer hath any blemish, shall not come neere: as a man blinde or lame, or that hath a flat nose, or that hath any misshapen member, 
\v 19 Or a man that hath a broken foote, or a broken hande, 
\v 20 Or is crooke backt, or bleare eyed, or hath a blemish in his eye, or be skiruie, or skabbed, or haue his stones broken. 
\v 21 None of the seede of Aaron the Priest that hath a blemish, shall come neere to offer the sacrifices of the Lord made by fire, hauing a blemish: he shall not prease to offer the bread of his God. 
\v 22 The bread of his God, euen of the most holie, and of the holy shall he eate: 
\v 23 But he shall not goe in vnto the vaile, nor come neere the altar, because hee hath a blemish, least he pollute my Sanctuaries: for I am the Lord that sanctifie them. 
\v 24 Thus spake Moses vnto Aaron, and to his sonnes, and to all the children of Israel. 
\c 22  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Speake vnto Aaron, and to his sonnes, that they be separated from the holy thinges of the children of Israel, and that they pollute not mine holy name in those things, which they hallowe vnto me: I am the Lord. 
\v 3 Say vnto them, Whosoeuer he be of all your seede among your generations after you, that toucheth the holy things which the children of Israel hallowe vnto the Lord, hauing his vncleannesse vpon him, euen that person shall be cut off from my sight: I am the Lord. 
\v 4 Whosoeuer also of the seede of Aaron is a leper, or hath a running issue, he shall not eate of the holy things vntill he be cleane: and who so toucheth any that is vncleane, by reason of the dead, or a man whose issue of seede runneth from him, 
\v 5 Or the man that toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be made vncleane, or a man, by whom he may take vncleannesse, whatsoeuer vncleannesse he hath, 
\v 6 The person that hath touched such, shall therefore be vncleane vntill the euen, and shall not eat of ye holy things, except he haue washed his flesh with water. 
\v 7 But when the Sunne is downe, hee shalbe cleane, and shall afterward eate of the holy things: for it is his foode. 
\v 8 Of a beast that dyeth, or is rent with beasts, whereby he may be defiled, hee shall not eate: I am the Lord. 
\v 9 Let them keepe therefore mine ordinance, least they beare their sinne for it, and die for it, if they defile it: I the Lord sanctifie them. 
\v 10 There shall no stranger also eate of the holie thing, neither the ghest of the Priest, neither shall an hired seruant eat of the holie thing: 
\v 11 But if the Priest bye any with money, he shall eate of it, also he that is borne in his house: they shall eate of his meate. 
\v 12 If the Priests daughter also be maried vnto a stranger, she may not eate of the holy offrings. 
\v 13 Notwithstanding if the Priests daughter be a widowe or diuorced, and haue no childe, but is returned vnto her fathers house shee shall eate of her fathers bread, as she did in her youth but there shall no stranger eate thereof. 
\v 14 If a man eate of the holie thing vnwittingly, he shall put the fift part thereunto, and giue it vnto the Priest with the halowed thing. 
\v 15 So they shall not defile the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer vnto the Lord, 
\v 16 Neither cause the people to beare the iniquitie of their trespas, while they eate their holy thing: for I the Lord do halowe them. 
\v 17 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 18 Speake vnto Aaron, and to his sonnes, and to all the children of Israel, and say vnto them, Whosoeuer he be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that will offer his sacrifice for all their vowes, and for all their free offrings, which they vse to offer vnto the Lord for a burnt offring, 
\v 19 Yee shall offer of your free minde a male without blemish of the beeues, of the sheepe, or of the goates. 
\v 20 Ye shall not offer any thing that hath a blemish: for that shall not be acceptable for you. 
\v 21 And whosoeuer bringeth a peace offring vnto ye Lord to accomplish his vowe, or for a free offring, of the beeues, or of the sheepe, his free offring shall bee perfect, no blemish shalbe in it. 
\v 22 Blinde, or broken, or maimed, or hauing a wenne, or skiruie, or skabbed: these shall yee not offer vnto the Lord nor make an offring by fire of these vpon the altar of the Lord. 
\v 23 Yet a bullocke, or a sheepe that hath any member superfluous, or lacking, such mayest thou present for a free offring, but for a vowe it shall not be accepted. 
\v 24 Ye shall not offer vnto ye Lord that which is bruised or crusshed, or broken, or cut away, neither shall ye make an offring thereof in your land, 
\v 25 Neither of ye hand of a strager shall ye offer ye bread of your God of any of these, because their corruption is in them, there is a blemish in them: therefore shall they not be accepted for you. 
\v 26 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 27 When a bullocke, or a sheepe, or a goate shall be brought foorth, it shalbe euen seuen daies vnder his damme: and from the eight day forth, it shalbe accepted for a sacrifice made by fire vnto the Lord. 
\v 28 As for the cowe or the ewe, yee shall not kill her, and her yong both in one day. 
\v 29 So when ye will offer a thanke offring vnto the Lord, ye shall offer willingly. 
\v 30 The same day it shalbe eaten, yee shall leaue none of it vntill the morowe: I am the Lord. 
\v 31 Therefore shall ye keepe my commandements and do them: for I am the Lord. 
\v 32 Neither shall ye pollute mine holy Name, but I will be halowed among the children of Israel. I the Lord sanctifie you, 
\v 33 Which haue brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the Lord. 
\c 23  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say vnto them, The feastes of ye Lord which yee shall call ye holie assemblies, euen these are my feasts. 
\v 3 Six daies shall worke be done, but in the seuenth day shalbe the Sabbath of rest, an holie conuocation: ye shall do no worke therein, it is the Sabbath of the Lord, in all your dwellings. 
\v 4 These are the feastes of the Lord, and holie conuocations, which yee shall proclaime in their seasons. 
\v 5 In the first moneth, and in the fourteenth day of the moneth at euening shalbe ye Passeouer of the Lord. 
\v 6 And on the fifteenth day of this moneth shalbe the feast of vnleauened bread vnto the Lord: seuen dayes ye shall eate vnleauened bread. 
\v 7 In the first day yee shall haue an holy conuocation: ye shall do no seruile worke therein. 
\v 8 Also ye shall offer sacrifice made by fire vnto the Lord seuen daies, and in the seuenth day shalbe an holie conuocation: ye shall do no seruile worke therein. 
\v 9 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 10 Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say vnto them, When ye be come into ye land which I giue vnto you, and reape the haruest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheafe of the first fruites of your haruest vnto the Priest, 
\v 11 And hee shall shake the sheafe before the Lord, that it may be acceptable for you: the morowe after the Sabbath, the Priest shall shake it. 
\v 12 And that day when yee shake the sheafe, shall yee prepare a lambe without blemish of a yeere olde, for a burnt offring vnto the Lord: 
\v 13 And the meate offring thereof shalbe two tenth deales of fine floure mingled with oyle, for a sacrifice made by fire vnto ye Lord of sweete sauour. and the drinke offring thereof the fourth part of an Hin of wine. 
\v 14 And ye shall eat neither bread nor parched corne, nor greene eares vntill the selfe same day that ye haue brought an offring vnto your God: this shalbe a lawe for euer in your generations and in all your dwellings. 
\v 15 Ye shall count also to you from the morowe after the Sabbath, euen from the day that yee shall bring the sheafe of the shake offring, seuen Sabbaths, they shalbe complete. 
\v 16 Vnto ye morow after the seuenth Sabbath shall ye nomber fiftie dayes: then yee shall bring a newe meate offring vnto the Lord. 
\v 17 Ye shall bring out of your habitations bread for the shake offring: they shalbe two loaues of two tenth deales of fine floure, which shalbe baken with leauen for first fruites vnto the Lord. 
\v 18 Also yee shall offer with the bread seuen lambes without blemish of one yeere olde, and a yong bullocke and two rams: they shalbe for a burnt offring vnto the Lord, with their meate offrings and their drinke offrings, for a sacrifice made by fire of a sweete sauour vnto the Lord. 
\v 19 Then ye shall prepare an hee goate for a sinne offring, and two lambes of one yeere olde for peace offrings. 
\v 20 And the Priest shall shake them to and from with the bread of the first fruits before the Lord, and with the two lambes: they shalbe holy to the Lord, for the Priest. 
\v 21 So ye shall proclayme the same day, that it may be an holie conuocation vnto you: ye shall doe no seruile worke therein: it shalbe an ordinance for euer in al your dwellinges, throughout your generations. 
\v 22 And when you reape the haruest of your land, thou shalt not rid cleane the corners of thy field when thou reapest, neither shalt thou make any aftergathering of thy haruest, but shalt leaue them vnto the poore and to the stranger: I am the Lord your God. 
\v 23 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 24 Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say, In the seuenth moneth, and in the first day of the moneth shall ye haue a Sabbath, for the remembrance of blowing the trumpets, an holy conuocation. 
\v 25 Ye shall do no seruile worke therein, but offer sacrifice made by fire vnto the Lord. 
\v 26 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 27 The tenth also of this seuenth moneth shalbe a day of reconciliation: it shalbe an holie conuocation vnto you, and yee shall humble your soules, and offer sacrifice made by fire vnto the Lord. 
\v 28 And ye shall doe no worke that same day: for it is a day of reconciliation, to make an atonement for you before the Lord your God. 
\v 29 For euery person that humbleth not himselfe that same day, shall euen be cut off from his people. 
\v 30 And euery person that shall doe any work that same day, the same person also will I destroy from among his people. 
\v 31 Ye shall do no maner worke therefore: this shalbe a law for euer in your generations, throughout all your dwellings. 
\v 32 This shalbe vnto you a Sabbath of rest, and ye shall humble your soules: in the ninth day of the moneth at euen, from euen to euen shall ye celebrate your Sabbath. 
\v 33 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 34 Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say, In the fifteenth day of this seueth moneth shalbe for seuen dayes the feast of Tabernacles vnto the Lord. 
\v 35 In the first day shalbe an holie conuocation: ye shall do no seruile worke therein. 
\v 36 Seuen daies ye shall offer sacrifice made by fire vnto the Lord, and in the eight day shalbe an holy conuocation vnto you, and ye shall offer sacrifices made by fire vnto the Lord: it is the solemne assemblie, yee shall doe no seruile worke therein. 
\v 37 These are the feastes of the Lord (which ye shall call holie conuocations) to offer sacrifice made by fire vnto the Lord, as burnt offring, and meate offring, sacrifice, and drinke offrings, euery one vpon his day, 
\v 38 Beside the Sabbaths of the Lord, and beside your giftes, and beside al your vowes, and beside all your free offrings, which ye shall giue vnto the Lord. 
\v 39 But in the fifteenth day of the seueth moneth, when ye haue gathered in the fruite of the land, ye shall keepe an holie feast vnto the Lord seuen daies: in the first day shalbe a Sabbath: likewise in the eight day shalbe a Sabbath. 
\v 40 And yee shall take you in the first day the fruite of goodly trees, branches of palme trees, and the boughes of thicke trees, and willowes of the brooke, and shall reioyce before the Lord your God seuen daies. 
\v 41 So ye shall keepe this feast vnto the Lord seuen daies in the yere, by a perpetuall ordinance through your generations: in the seuenth moneth shall you keepe it. 
\v 42 Ye shall dwell in boothes seuen daies: all that are Israelites borne, shall dwel in boothes, 
\v 43 That your posterity may know that I haue made the children of Israel to dwell in boothes, when I brought them out of the lande of Egypt: I am the Lord your God. 
\v 44 So Moses declared vnto the children of Israel the feastes of the Lord. 
\c 24  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Commande the children of Israel that they bring vnto thee pure oyle oliue beaten, for the light, to cause ye lampes to burne continually. 
\v 3 Without the vaile of the Testimonie, in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, shall Aaron dresse them, both euen and morning before the Lord alwayes: this shalbe a lawe for euer through your generations. 
\v 4 He shall dresse the lampes vpon the pure Candlesticke before the Lord perpetually. 
\v 5 Also thou shalt take fine floure, and bake twelue cakes thereof: two tenth deales shalbe in one cake. 
\v 6 And thou shalt set them in two rowes, six in a rowe vpon the pure table before the Lord. 
\v 7 Thou shalt also put pure incense vpon the rowes, that in steade of the bread it may bee for a remembrance, and an offering made by fire to the Lord. 
\v 8 Euery Sabbath hee shall put them in rowes before the Lord euermore, receiuing them of the children of Israel for an euerlasting couenant. 
\v 9 And the bread shalbe Aarons and his sonnes, and they shall eate it in the holie place: for it is most holie vnto him of the offrings of the Lord made by fire by a perpetuall ordinance. 
\v 10 And there went out among the children of Israel the sonne of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an Egyptian: and this sonne of the Israelitish woman, and a man of Israel stroue together in the hoste. 
\v 11 So the Israelitish womans sonne blasphemed the name of the Lord, and cursed, and they brought him vnto Moses (his mothers name also was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan) 
\v 12 And they put him in warde, till he tolde them the minde of the Lord. 
\v 13 Then the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 14 Bring the blasphemer without the hoste, and let all that heard him, put their handes vpon his head, and let all the Congregation stone him. 
\v 15 And thou shalt speake vnto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoeuer curseth his God, shall beare his sinne. 
\v 16 And he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, shalbe put to death: all the Congregation shall stone him to death: aswell the stranger, as he that is borne in the lande: when he blasphemeth the name of the Lord, let him beslaine. 
\v 17 He also that killeth any man, he shall be put to death. 
\v 18 And he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it, beast for beast. 
\v 19 Also if a man cause any blemish in his neighbour: as he hath done, so shall it be done to him. 
\v 20 Breache for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: such a blemish as he hath made in any, such shalbe repayed to him. 
\v 21 And he that killeth a beast shall restore it: but he that killeth a man shall be slaine. 
\v 22 Ye shall haue one lawe: it shalbe aswel for the stranger as for one borne in the countrey: for I am the Lord your God. 
\v 23 Then Moses tolde the children of Israel, and they brought the blasphemer out of the hoste, and stoned him with stones: so the children of Israel did as the Lord had commanded Moses. 
\c 25  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spake vnto Moses in mount Sinai, saying, 
\v 2 Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say vnto them, When ye shall come into the lande which I giue you, the lande shall keepe Sabbath vnto the Lord. 
\v 3 Sixe yeeres thou shalt sowe thy field, and sixe yeeres thou shalt cut thy vineyarde, and gather the fruite thereof. 
\v 4 But the seuenth yeere shalbe a Sabbath of rest vnto the lande: it shall be the Lordes Sabbath: thou shalt neither sowe thy fielde, nor cut thy vineyarde. 
\v 5 That which groweth of it owne accorde of thy haruest, thou shalt not reape, neither gather the grapes that thou hast left vnlaboured: for it shalbe a yeere of rest vnto the land. 
\v 6 And the rest of the lande shall be meate for you, euen for thee, and for thy seruant, and for thy mayde, and for thy hired seruant, and for the stranger that soiourneth with thee: 
\v 7 And for thy cattell, and for the beastes that are in thy lande shall all the encrease thereof be meate. 
\v 8 Also thou shalt number seuen Sabbaths of yeeres vnto thee, euen seuen times seuen yeere: and the space of the seuen Sabbaths of yeeres will be vnto thee nine and fourtie yeere. 
\v 9 Then thou shalt cause to blow the trumpet of the Iubile in the tenth day of the seuenth moneth: euen in the day of the reconciliation shall ye make the trumpet blowe, throughout all your lande. 
\v 10 And ye shall halowe that yeere, euen the fiftieth yeere, and proclaime libertie in the lande to all the inhabitants thereof: it shalbe the Iubile vnto you, and ye shall returne euery man vnto his possession, and euery man shall returne vnto his familie. 
\v 11 This fiftieth yeere shalbe a yeere of Iubile vnto you: ye shall not sowe, neither reape that which groweth of it selfe, neither gather the grapes thereof, that are left vnlaboured. 
\v 12 For it is the Iubile, it shall be holy vnto you: ye shall eate of the encrease thereof out of the fielde. 
\v 13 In the yeere of this Iubile, ye shall returne euery man vnto his possession. 
\v 14 And when thou sellest ought to thy neighbour, or byest at thy neighbours hande, ye shall not oppresse one another: 
\v 15 But according to the nomber of yeeres after the Iubile thou shalt bye of thy neighbour: also according to the nomber of the yeeres of the reuenues, he shall sell vnto thee. 
\v 16 According to the multitude of yeeres, thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewnesse of yeeres, thou shalt abate the price of it: for the nomber of fruites doeth he sell vnto thee. 
\v 17 Oppresse not ye therefore any man his neighbour, but thou shalt feare thy God: for I am the Lord your God. 
\v 18 Wherefore ye shall obey mine ordinances, and keepe my lawes, and do them, and ye shall dwell in the land in safetie. 
\v 19 And the lande shall giue her fruite, and ye shall eate your fill, and dwell therein in safetie. 
\v 20 And if ye shall say, What shall we eate the seuenth yeere, for we shall not sowe, nor gather in our increase? 
\v 21 I will sende my blessing vpon you in the sixt yeere, and it shall bring foorth fruite for three yeeres. 
\v 22 And ye shall sowe the eight yeere, and eate of the olde fruite vntill the ninth yeere: vntill the fruite thereof come, ye shall eate the olde. 
\v 23 Also the lande shall not be solde to be cut off from the familie: for the land is mine, and ye be but strangers and soiourners with me. 
\v 24 Therefore in all the land of your possession ye shall graunt a redemption for the lande. 
\v 25 If thy brother be impouerished, and sell his possession, then his redeemer shall come, euen his neere kinsman, and bye out that which his brother solde. 
\v 26 And if he haue no redeemer, but hath gotten and founde to bye it out, 
\v 27 Then shall he count the yeeres of his sale, and restore the ouerplus to the man, to whome he solde it: so shall he returne to his possession. 
\v 28 But if he can not get sufficient to restore to him, then that which is solde, shall remaine in the hande of him that hath bought it, vntill the yere of the Iubile: and in the Iubile it shall come out, and he shall returne vnto his possession. 
\v 29 Likewise if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled citie, he may bye it out againe within a whole yeere after it is solde: within a yeere may he bye it out. 
\v 30 But if it be not bought out within ye space of a ful yeere, then the house that is in the walled citie, shalbe stablished, as cut off from the familie, to him that bought it, throughout his generations: it shall not goe out in the Iubile. 
\v 31 But the houses of villages, which haue no walles round about them, shalbe esteemed as the fielde of the countrey: they may be bought out againe, and shall goe out in the Iubile. 
\v 32 Notwithstanding, the cities of the Leuites, and the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Leuites redeeme at all seasons. 
\v 33 And if a man purchase of the Leuites, the house that was solde, and the citie of their possession shall goe out in the Iubile: for the houses of the cities of the Leuites are their possession among the children of Israel. 
\v 34 But the fielde of the suburbes of their cities, shall not be solde: for it is their perpetuall possession. 
\v 35 Moreouer, if thy brother be impouerished, and fallen in decay with thee, thou shalt relieue him, and as a stranger and soiourner, so shall he liue with thee. 
\v 36 Thou shalt take no vsurie of him, nor vantage, but thou shalt feare thy God, that thy brother may liue with thee. 
\v 37 Thou shalt not giue him thy money to vsurie, nor lende him thy vitailes for increase. 
\v 38 I am the Lord your God, which haue brought you out of the lande of Egypt, to giue you the lande of Canaan, and to be your God. 
\v 39 If thy brother also that dwelleth by thee, be impouerished, and be sold vnto thee, thou shalt not compel him to serue as a bond seruant, 
\v 40 But as an hired seruant, and as a soiourner he shalbe with thee: he shall serue thee vnto the yeere of the Iubile. 
\v 41 Then shall he depart from thee, both hee, and his children with him, and shall returne vnto his familie, and vnto the possession of his fathers shall he returne: 
\v 42 For they are my seruants, whom I brought out of the lande of Egypt: they shall not be solde as bondmen are solde. 
\v 43 Thou shalt not rule ouer him cruelly, but shalt feare thy God. 
\v 44 Thy bond seruant also, and thy bond maid, which thou shalt haue, shalbe of the heathen that are rounde about you: of them shall ye bye seruants and maydes. 
\v 45 And moreouer of the children of the stragers, that are soiourners among you, of them shall ye bye, and of their families that are with you, which they begate in your lande: these shall be your possession. 
\v 46 So ye shall take them as inheritance for your children after you, to possesse them by inheritance, ye shall vse their labours for euer: but ouer your brethren the children of Israel ye shall not rule one ouer another with crueltie. 
\v 47 If a soiourner or a stranger dwelling by thee get riches, and thy brother by him be impouerished, and sell him selfe vnto the stranger or soiourner dwelling by thee, or to the stocke of the strangers familie, 
\v 48 After that he is solde, he may be bought out: one of his brethren may bye him out, 
\v 49 Or his vncle, or his vncles sonne may bye him out, or any of the kindred of his flesh among his familie, may redeeme him: either if he can get so much, he may bye him selfe out. 
\v 50 Then he shall recken with his byer from the yeere that he was solde to him, vnto the yere of Iubile: and the money of his sale shalbe according to the number of yeeres: according to the time of an hyred seruant shall he be with him. 
\v 51 If there be many yeeres behind, according to them he shall giue againe for his deliuerance, of the money that he was bought for. 
\v 52 If there remaine but fewe yeeres vnto the yeere of Iubile, then he shall count with him, and according to his yeeres giue againe for his redemption. 
\v 53 He shalbe with him yeere by yeere as an hired seruant: he shall not rule cruelly ouer him in thy sight. 
\v 54 And if he be not redeemed thus, he shall go out in the yeere of Iubile, he, and his children with him. 
\v 55 For vnto me the children of Israel are seruants: they are my seruants, who I haue brought out of the land of Egypt: I am ye Lord your God. 
\c 26  
\p
\v 1 Ye shall make you none idoles nor grauen image, neither reare you vp any pillar, neither shall ye set any image of stone in your land to bow downe to it: for I am the Lord your God. 
\v 2 Ye shall keepe my Sabbaths, and reuerence my Sanctuarie: I am the Lord. 
\v 3 If ye walke in mine ordinances, and keepe my commandements, and doe them, 
\v 4 I will then sende you raine in due season, and the land shall yelde her increase, and the trees of the fielde shall giue her fruite. 
\v 5 And your threshing shall reache vnto the vintage, and the vintage shall reache vnto sowing time, and you shall eate your bread in plenteousnesse, and dwell in your land safely. 
\v 6 And I will sende peace in the land, and ye shall sleepe and none shall make you afraid: also I will rid euill beastes out of the lande, and the sworde shall not go through your lande. 
\v 7 Also ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you vpon the sworde. 
\v 8 And fiue of you shall chase an hundreth, and an hundreth of you shall put ten thousande to flight, and your enemies shall fall before you vpon the sworde. 
\v 9 For I will haue respect vnto you, and make you encrease, and multiplie you, and establish my couenant with you. 
\v 10 Ye shall eate also olde store, and cary out olde because of the newe. 
\v 11 And I will set my Tabernacle among you, and my soule shall not lothe you. 
\v 12 Also I will walke among you, and I wil be your God, and ye shalbe my people. 
\v 13 I am the Lord your God which haue brought you out of the lande of Egypt, that yee should not be their bondmen, and I haue broken ye bonds of your yoke, and made you goe vpright. 
\v 14 But if ye will not obey me, nor do all these commandements, 
\v 15 And if ye shall despise mine ordinances, either if your soule abhorre my lawes, so that yee will not do all my commandements, but breake my couenant, 
\v 16 Then wil I also do this vnto you, I wil appoint ouer you fearefulnes, a consumption, and the burning ague to consume the eyes, and make the heart heauie, and you shall sowe your seede in vaine: for your enemies shall eate it: 
\v 17 And I will set my face against you, and ye shall fal before your enemies, and they that hate you, shall raigne ouer you, and yee shall flee when none pursueth you. 
\v 18 And if ye wil not for these things obey me, then wil I punish you seuen times more, according to your sinnes, 
\v 19 And I wil breake the pride of your power, and I will make your heauen as yron, and your earth as brasse: 
\v 20 And your strength shalbe spent in vaine: neither shall your lande giue her increase, neither shall the trees of the land giue their fruite. 
\v 21 And if ye walke stubburnly against me, and will not obey mee, I will then bring seuen times more plagues vpon you, according to your sinnes. 
\v 22 I will also sende wilde beastes vpon you, which shall spoyle you, and destroy your cattell, and make you fewe in number: so your hye waies shalbe desolate. 
\v 23 Yet if by these ye will not be reformed by me, but walke stubburnly against me, 
\v 24 Then wil I also walke stubburnly against you, and I will smite you yet seuen times for your sinnes: 
\v 25 And I wil send a sword vpon you, that shall auenge the quarel of my couenant: and when ye are gathered in your cities, I wil send the pestilence among you, and ye shall be deliuered into the hand of the enemie. 
\v 26 When I shall breake the staffe of your bread, then ten women shall bake your breade in one ouen, and they shall deliuer your bread againe by weight, and ye shall eate, but not be satisfied. 
\v 27 Yet if ye will not for this obey mee, but walke against me stubburnly, 
\v 28 Then will I walke stubburnly in mine anger against you, and I will also chastice you seuen times more according to your sinnes. 
\v 29 And ye shall eate ye flesh of your sonnes, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye deuoure. 
\v 30 I will also destroy your hye places, and cut away your images, and cast your carkeises vpon the bodies of your idoles, and my soule shall abhorre you. 
\v 31 And I will make your cities desolate, and bring your Sanctuarie vnto nought, and will not smelll the sauour of your sweete odours. 
\v 32 I will also bring the land vnto a wildernes, and your enemies, which dwell therein, shalbe astonished thereat. 
\v 33 Also I wil scatter you among the heathen, and will drawe out a sworde after you, and your land shalbe waste, and your cities shalbe desolate. 
\v 34 Then shall the land inioy her Sabbaths, as long as it lieth voide, and yee shalbe in your enemies land: then shall the land rest, and enioy her Sabbaths. 
\v 35 All the dayes that it lieth voide, it shall rest, because it did not rest in your Sabbaths, when ye dwelt vpon it. 
\v 36 And vpon them that are left of you, I will send euen a faintnes into their hearts in ye land of their enemies, and the sounde of a leafeshaken shall chase them, and they shall flee as fleeing from a sword, and they shall fall, no man pursuing them. 
\v 37 They shall fall also one vpon another, as before a sword, though none pursue them, and ye shall not be able to stand before your enemies: 
\v 38 And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eate you vp. 
\v 39 And they that are left of you, shall pine away for their iniquitie, in your enemies landes, and for the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them also. 
\v 40 Then they shall confesse their iniquitie, and the wickednes of their fathers for their trespasse, which they haue trespassed against mee, and also because they haue walked stubburnly against me. 
\v 41 Therefore I wil walke stubburnly against them, and bring them into the land of their enemies: so then their vncircumcised hearts shalbe humbled, and then they shalt willingly beare the punishment of their iniquitie. 
\v 42 Then I will remember my couenant with Iaakob, and my couenant also with Izhak, and also my couenant with Abraham will I remember, and will remember the land. 
\v 43 The land also in the meane season shalbe left of them, and shall enioye her Sabbaths while she lieth waste without them, but they shall willingly suffer the punishment of their iniquitie, because they despised my lawes, and because their soule abhorred mine ordinances. 
\v 44 Yet notwithstanding this, when they shalbe in the lande of their enemies, I wil not cast them away, neither will I abhorre them, to destroy them vtterly, nor to breake my couenant with them: for I am the Lord their God: 
\v 45 But I will remember for them the couenant of olde when I brought them out of ye land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen that I might be their God: I am the Lord. 
\v 46 These are the ordinances, and the iudgements, and the lawes, which the Lord made betweene him, and the children of Israel in mount Sinai, by the hand of Moses. 
\c 27  
\p
\v 1 Moreouer the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say vnto them, If any man shall make a vowe of a person vnto the Lord, by thy estimation, 
\v 3 Then thy estimation shall bee thus: a male from twentie yeere olde vnto sixty yeere olde shalbe by thy estimation euen fifty shekels of siluer, after the shekel of the Sanctuarie. 
\v 4 But if it be a female, then thy valuation shall be thirtie shekels. 
\v 5 And from fiue yere old to twentie yere olde thy valuation shall be for the male twentie shekels, and for the female ten shekels. 
\v 6 But from a moneth old vnto fiue yere old, thy price of the male shall bee fiue shekels of siluer, and thy price of the female, three shekels of siluer. 
\v 7 And from sixty yeere olde and aboue, if he be a male, then thy price shalbe fifteene shekels, and for the female ten shekels. 
\v 8 But if he be poorer then thou hast esteemed him, then shall hee present himselfe before the Priest, and the Priest shall value him, according to the abilitie of him that vowed, so shall the Priest value him. 
\v 9 And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering vnto the Lord, all that one giueth of such vnto the Lord, shalbe holy. 
\v 10 He shall not alter it nor change it, a good for a badde, nor a badde for a good: and if hee change beast for beast, then both this and that, which was changed for it, shall be holy. 
\v 11 And if it be any vncleane beast, of which men do not offer a sacrifice vnto the Lord, hee shall then present the beast before the Priest. 
\v 12 And the Priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: and as thou valuest it, which art the Priest, so shall it bee. 
\v 13 But if he will bye it againe, then hee shall giue the fift part of it more, aboue thy valuation. 
\v 14 Also whe a man shall dedicate his house to be holy vnto the Lord, then the Priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad, and as ye Priest shall prise it, so shall the value be. 
\v 15 But if he that sanctified it, will redeeme his house, then hee shall giue thereto the fift part of money more then thy estimation, and it shalbe his. 
\v 16 If also a man dedicate to the Lord any grounde of his inheritance, then shalt thou esteeme it according to the seede therof: an Homer of barlie seede shalbe at fiftie shekels of siluer. 
\v 17 If he dedicate his field immediatly from the yeere of Iubile, it shall bee worth as thou doest esteeme it. 
\v 18 But if hee dedicate his fielde after the Iubile, then the Priest shall recken him the money according to ye yeeres that remaine vnto the yere of Iubile, and it shalbe abated by thy estimation. 
\v 19 And if he that dedicateth it, will redeeme the fielde, then he shall put the fift parte of the price, that thou esteemedst it at, thereunto, and it shall remaine his. 
\v 20 And if he will not redeeme the fielde, but the Priest sell the fielde to another man, it shalbe redeemed no more. 
\v 21 But the field shalbe holy to the Lord, whe it goeth out in the Iubile, as a fielde separate from common vses: the possession thereof shall be the Priests. 
\v 22 If a man also dedicate vnto ye Lord a fielde which he hath bought, which is not of the groud of his inheritance, 
\v 23 Then the Priest shall set the price to him, as thou esteemest it, vnto the yeere of Iubile, and he shall giue thy price the same day, as a thing holy vnto the Lord. 
\v 24 But in the yeere of Iubile, the fielde shall returne vnto him, of whome it was bought: to him, I say, whose inheritance the land was. 
\v 25 And all thy valuation shall bee according to the shekel of the Sanctuarie: a shekel conteyneth twenty gerahs. 
\v 26 Notwithstanding the first borne of the beastes, because it is the Lordes first borne, none shall dedicate such, be it bullocke, or sheepe; for it is the Lords. 
\v 27 But if it be an vncleane beast, then he shall redeeme it by thy valuation, and giue the fift part more thereto: and if it be not redeemed, then it shalbe solde, according to thy estimation. 
\v 28 Notwithstanding, nothing separate from the common vse that a man doeth separate vnto the Lord of all that he hath (whether it bee man or beast, or lande of his inheritance) may be solde nor redeemed: for euery thing separate from the common vse is most holy vnto the Lord. 
\v 29 Nothing separate from the common vse, which shall be separate from man, shalbe redeemed, but dye the death. 
\v 30 Also all the tithe of the lande both of the seede of the ground, and of the fruite of the trees is the Lords: it is holy to the Lord. 
\v 31 But if a man will redeeme any of his tithe, he shall adde the fift part thereto. 
\v 32 And euery tithe of bullock, and of sheepe, and of all that goeth vnder the rod, the tenth shalbe holy vnto the Lord. 
\v 33 He shall not looke if it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: els if he change it, both it, and that it was changed withall, shalbe holy, and it shall not be redeemed. 
\v 34 These are the commandements which the Lord commanded by Moses vnto the children of Israel in mount Sinai.
