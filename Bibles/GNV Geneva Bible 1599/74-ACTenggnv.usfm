\mt1 THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 
\c 1  
\p
\v 1 I have made the former treatise, O Theophilus, of al that Jesus began to doe and teach, 
\v 2 Vntill the day that hee was taken vp, after that hee through the holy Ghost, had giuen commandements vnto the Apostles, whome hee had chosen: 
\v 3 To whome also he presented himselfe aliue after that he had suffered, by many infallible tokens, being seene of them by the space of fourtie daies, and speaking of those thinges which appertaine to the kingdome of God. 
\v 4 And when he had gathered them together, he commanded them, that they should not depart from Hierusalem, but to waite for the promise of the Father, which sayde hee, yee haue heard of me. 
\v 5 For Iohn in deede baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized with the holy Ghost within these fewe daies. 
\v 6 When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore the kingdome to Israel? 
\v 7 And hee saide vnto them, It is not for you to know the times, or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his owne power, 
\v 8 But yee shall receiue power of the holy Ghost, when he shall come on you: and ye shalbe witnesses vnto me both in Hierusalem and in all Iudea, and in Samaria, and vnto the vttermost part of the earth. 
\v 9 And when he had spoken these things, while they behelde, he was taken vp: for a cloude tooke him vp out of their sight. 
\v 10 And while they looked stedfastly towarde heauen, as hee went, beholde, two men stoode by them in white apparell, 
\v 11 Which also sayde, Yee men of Galile, why stande yee gasing into heauen? This Iesus which is taken vp from you into heauen, shall so come, as yee haue seene him goe into heauen. 
\v 12 Then returned they vnto Hierusalem from the mount that is called the mount of Oliues, which is neere to Hierusalem, being from it a Sabbath daies iourney. 
\v 13 And when they were come in, they went vp into an vpper chamber, where abode both Peter and Iames, and Iohn, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartlemew, and Matthewe, Iames the sonne of Alpheus, and Simon Zelotes, and Iudas Iames brother. 
\v 14 These all continued with one accorde in prayer and supplication with the women, and Marie the mother of Iesus, and with his brethren. 
\v 15 And in those dayes Peter stoode vp in the middes of the disciples, and sayde (nowe the nomber of names that were in one place were about an hundreth and twentie.) 
\v 16 Yee men and brethren, this scripture must needes haue beene fulfilled, which the holy Ghost by the mouth of Dauid spake before of Iudas, which was guide to them that tooke Iesus. 
\v 17 For hee was nombred with vs, and had obteined fellowship in this ministration. 
\v 18 He therefore hath purchased a field with the reward of iniquitie: and when he had throwen downe himselfe headlong, hee brast asunder in the middes, and all his bowels gushed out. 
\v 19 And it is knowen vnto all the inhabitants of Hierusalem, in so much, that that field is called in their owne language, Aceldama, That is, the field of blood. 
\v 20 For it is written in the booke of Psalmes, Let his habitation be void, and let no man dwel therein: also, Let another take his charge. 
\v 21 Wherefore of these men which haue companied with vs, all the time that the Lord Iesus was conuersant among vs, 
\v 22 Beginning from the baptisme of Iohn vnto the day that hee was taken vp from vs, must one of them bee made a witnesse with vs of his resurrection. 
\v 23 And they presented two, Ioseph called Barsabas, whose surname was Iustus, and Matthias. 
\v 24 And they praied, saying, Thou Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, shewe whether of these two thou hast chosen, 
\v 25 That he may take the roume of this ministration and Apostleship, from which Iudas hath gone astray, to goe to his owne place. 
\v 26 Then they gaue foorth their lottes: and the lotte fell on Matthias, and hee was by a common consent counted with the eleuen Apostles. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 And when the day of Pentecost was come, they were al with one accord in one place. 
\v 2 And suddenly there came a sounde from heauen, as of a russhing and mightie winde, and it filled all the house where they sate. 
\v 3 And there appeared vnto them clouen tongues, like fire, and it sate vpon eche of them. 
\v 4 And they were all filled with the holy Ghost, and began to speake with other tongues, as the Spirit gaue them vtterance. 
\v 5 And there were dwelling at Hierusalem Iewes, men that feared God, of euery nation vnder heauen. 
\v 6 Nowe when this was noised, the multitude came together and were astonied, because that euery man heard them speake his owne language. 
\v 7 And they wondered al, and marueiled, saying among themselues, Beholde, are not all these which speake, of Galile? 
\v 8 How then heare we euery man our owne language, wherein we were borne? 
\v 9 Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the inhabitants of Mesopotamia, and of Iudea, and of Cappadocia, of Pontus, and Asia, 
\v 10 And of Phrygia, and Pamphylia, of Egypt, and of the partes of Libya, which is beside Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, and Iewes, and Proselytes, 
\v 11 Creetes, and Arabians: wee hearde them speake in our owne tongues the wonderful works of God. 
\v 12 They were all then amased, and douted, saying one to another, What may this be? 
\v 13 And others mocked, and saide, They are full of newe wine. 
\v 14 But Peter standing with ye Eleuen, lift vp his voice, and said vnto them, Ye men of Iudea, and ye all that inhabite Hierusalem, be this knowen vnto you, and hearken vnto my woordes. 
\v 15 For these are not drunken, as yee suppose, since it is but the third houre of the day. 
\v 16 But this is that, which was spoken by the Prophet Ioel, 
\v 17 And it shalbe in the last daies, saith God, I wil powre out of my Spirite vpon al flesh, and your sonnes, and your daughters shall prophecie, and your yong men shall see visions, and your old men shall dreame dreames. 
\v 18 And on my seruauntes, and on mine handmaides I will powre out of my Spirite in those daies, and they shall prophecie. 
\v 19 And I wil shew wonders in heauen aboue, and tokens in the earth beneath, blood, and fire, and the vapour of smoke. 
\v 20 The Sunne shalbe turned into darkenesse, and the moone into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come. 
\v 21 And it shalbe, that whosoeuer shall call on the Name of the Lord, shalbe saued. 
\v 22 Yee men of Israel, heare these woordes, JESUS of Nazareth, a man approued of God among you with great workes, and wonders, and signes, which God did by him in the middes of you, as yee your selues also knowe: 
\v 23 Him, I say, being deliuered by the determinate counsell, and foreknowledge of God, after you had taken, with wicked handes you haue crucified and slaine. 
\v 24 Whome God hath raised vp, and loosed the sorrowes of death, because it was vnpossible that he should be holden of it. 
\v 25 For Dauid sayeth concerning him, I beheld the Lord alwaies before me: for hee is at my right hand, that I should not be shaken. 
\v 26 Therefore did mine heart reioyce, and my tongue was glad, and moreouer also my flesh shall rest in hope, 
\v 27 Because thou wilt not leaue my soule in graue, neither wilt suffer thine Holy one to see corruption. 
\v 28 Thou hast shewed me the waies of life, and shalt make me full of ioy with thy countenance. 
\v 29 Men and brethren, I may boldly speake vnto you of the Patriarke Dauid, that hee is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre remaineth with vs vnto this day. 
\v 30 Therefore, seeing hee was a Prophet, and knewe that God had sworne with an othe to him, that of the fruite of his loynes hee woulde raise vp Christ concerning the flesh, to set him vpon his throne, 
\v 31 Hee knowing this before, spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soule shoulde not bee left in graue, neither his flesh shoulde see corruption. 
\v 32 This Iesus hath God raised vp, whereof we all are witnesses. 
\v 33 Since then that he by the right hande of God hath bene exalted, and hath receiued of his Father the promise of the holy Ghost, hee hath shed foorth this which yee nowe see and heare. 
\v 34 For Dauid is not ascended into heauen, but he sayth, The Lord sayd to my Lord, Sit at my right hande, 
\v 35 Vntill I make thine enemies thy footestoole. 
\v 36 Therefore, let all the house of Israel know for a suretie, that God hath made him both Lord, and Christ, this Iesus, I say, whome yee haue crucified. 
\v 37 Now when they heard it, they were pricked in their heartes, and said vnto Peter and the other Apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we doe? 
\v 38 Then Peter said vnto them, Amend your liues, and bee baptized euery one of you in the Name of Iesus Christ for the remission of sinnes: and ye shall receiue the gift of the holy Ghost. 
\v 39 For the promise is made vnto you, and to your children, and to all that are a farre off, euen as many as the Lord our God shall call. 
\v 40 And with many other words he besought and exhorted them, saying, Saue your selues from this froward generation. 
\v 41 Then they that gladly receiued his word, were baptized: and the same day there were added to the Church about three thousand soules. 
\v 42 And they continued in the Apostles doctrine, and fellowship, and breaking of bread, and prayers. 
\v 43 And feare came vpon euery soule: and many wonders and signes were done by ye Apostles. 
\v 44 And all that beleeued, were in one place, and had all things common. 
\v 45 And they sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all me, as euery one had need. 
\v 46 And they continued dayly with one accord in the Temple, and breaking bread at home, did eate their meate together with gladnesse and singlenesse of heart, 
\v 47 Praysing God, and had fauour with all the people: and the Lord added to the Church from day to day, such as should be saued. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 Nowe Peter and Iohn went vp together into the Temple, at the ninth houre of prayer. 
\v 2 And a certaine man which was a creeple from his mothers wombe, was caried, whom they layde dayly at the gate of the Temple called Beautifull, to aske almes of them that entred into ye Temple. 
\v 3 Who seeing Peter and Iohn, that they would enter into the Temple, desired to receiue an almes. 
\v 4 And Peter earnestly beholding him with Iohn, said, Looke on vs. 
\v 5 And hee gaue heede vnto them, trusting to receiue some thing of them. 
\v 6 Then said Peter, Siluer and gold haue I none, but such as I haue, that giue I thee: In the Name of Iesus Christ of Nazareth, rise vp and walke. 
\v 7 And hee tooke him by the right hand, and lift him vp, and immediately his feete and ankle bones receiued strength. 
\v 8 And he leaped vp, stoode, and walked, and entred with them into the Temple, walking and leaping, and praysing God. 
\v 9 And all the people sawe him walke, and praysing God. 
\v 10 And they knewe him, that it was he which sate for the almes at the Beautifull gate of the Temple: and they were amased, and sore astonied at that, which was come vnto him. 
\v 11 And as the creeple which was healed, held Peter and Iohn, all the people ranne amased vnto them in the porch which is called Salomons. 
\v 12 So when Peter saw it, he answered vnto the people, Ye me of Israel, why marueile ye at this? or why looke ye so stedfastly on vs, as though by our owne power or godlines, we had made this man go? 
\v 13 The God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Iacob, the God of our fathers hath glorified his Sonne Iesus, whom ye betrayed, and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had iudged him to be deliuered. 
\v 14 But ye denied the Holy one and the Iust, and desired a murtherer to be giuen you, 
\v 15 And killed the Lord of life, whome God hath raised from the dead, whereof we are witnesses. 
\v 16 And his Name hath made this man sound, whom ye see, and know, through faith in his Name: and the faith which is by him, hath giuen to him this perfite health of his whole body in the presence of you all. 
\v 17 And now brethren, I know that through ignorance ye did it, as did also your gouernours. 
\v 18 But those thinges which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his Prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath thus fulfilled. 
\v 19 Amend your liues therefore, and turne, that your sinnes may be put away, whe the time of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord. 
\v 20 And he shall sende Iesus Christ, which before was preached vnto you, 
\v 21 Whome the heauen must containe vntill the time that all thinges be restored, which God had spoken by the mouth of all his holy Prophets since the world began. 
\v 22 For Moses said vnto the Fathers, The Lord your God shall raise vp vnto you a Prophet, euen of your brethren, like vnto me: ye shall heare him in all things, whatsoeuer he shall say vnto you. 
\v 23 For it shalbe that euery person which shall not heare that Prophet, shall be destroyed out of the people. 
\v 24 Also all the Prophets from Samuel, and thencefoorth as many as haue spoken, haue likewise foretolde of these dayes. 
\v 25 Ye are the children of the Prophets, and of the couenant, which God hath made vnto our fathers, saying to Abraham, Euen in thy seede shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed. 
\v 26 First vnto you hath God raysed vp his Sonne Iesus, and him hee hath sent to blesse you, in turning euery one of you from your iniquities. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 And as they spake vnto the people, the Priestes and the Captaine of the Temple, and the Sadduces came vpon them, 
\v 2 Taking it grieuously that they taught the people, and preached in Iesus Name the resurrection from the dead. 
\v 3 And they layde handes on them, and put them in holde, vntill the next day: for it was now euentide. 
\v 4 Howbeit, many of them which heard the word, beleeued, and the number of the men was about fiue thousand. 
\v 5 And it came to passe on the morow, that their rulers, and Elders, and Scribes, were gathered together at Hierusalem, 
\v 6 And Annas the chiefe Priest, and Caiaphas, and Iohn, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the hie Priestes. 
\v 7 And whe they had set them before them, they asked, By what power, or in what Name haue ye done this? 
\v 8 Then Peter ful of the holy Ghost, said vnto them, Ye rulers of the people, and Elders of Israel, 
\v 9 For as much as we this day are examined of the good deede done to the impotent man, to wit, by what meanes he is made whole, 
\v 10 Be it knowen vnto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the Name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye haue crucified, whome God raised againe from the dead, euen by him doth this man stand here before you, whole. 
\v 11 This is the stone cast aside of you builders which is become the head of the corner. 
\v 12 Neither is there saluation in any other: for among men there is giuen none other Name vnder heauen, whereby we must be saued. 
\v 13 Now when they sawe the boldnes of Peter and Iohn, and vnderstoode that they were vnlearned men and without knowledge, they marueiled, and knew them, that they had bin with Iesus: 
\v 14 And beholding also the man which was healed standing with them, they had nothing to say against it. 
\v 15 Then they commanded them to goe aside out of the Council, and conferred among themselues, 
\v 16 Saying, What shall we doe to these men? for surely a manifest signe is done by them, and it is openly knowen to all them that dwell in Hierusalem: and we cannot denie it. 
\v 17 But that it be noysed no farther among the people, let vs threaten and charge them, that they speake hencefoorth to no man in this Name. 
\v 18 So they called them, and commanded them, that in no wise they should speake or teach in the Name of Iesus. 
\v 19 But Peter and Iohn answered vnto them, and said, Whether it be right in the sight of God, to obey you rather then God, iudge ye. 
\v 20 For we cannot but speake the things which we haue seene and heard. 
\v 21 So they threatened them, and let them goe, and found nothing how to punish them, because of the people: for all men praised God for that which was done. 
\v 22 For the man was aboue fourtie yeeres olde, on whome this miracle of healing was shewed. 
\v 23 Then assoone as they were let goe, they came to their fellowes, and shewed all that the hie Priestes and Elders had said vnto them. 
\v 24 And when they heard it, they lift vp their voyces to God with one accord, and said, O Lord, thou art the God which hast made the heaue, and the earth, the sea, and all things that are in them, 
\v 25 Which by the mouth of thy seruant Dauid hast saide, Why did the Gentiles rage, and the people imagine vaine things? 
\v 26 The Kings of the earth assembled, and the rulers came together against the Lord, and against his Christ. 
\v 27 For doutlesse, against thine holy Sonne Iesus, whome thou haddest anoynted, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel gathered themselues together, 
\v 28 To doe whatsoeuer thine hand, and thy counsell had determined before to be done. 
\v 29 And nowe, O Lord, beholde their threatnings, and graunt vnto thy seruants with all boldnesse to speake thy word, 
\v 30 So that thou stretch forth thine hand, that healing, and signes, and wonders may be done by the Name of thine holy Sonne Iesus. 
\v 31 And when as they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together, and they were all filled with the holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God boldely. 
\v 32 And the multitude of them that beleeued, were of one heart, and of one soule: neither any of them said, that any thing of that which he possessed, was his owne, but they had all thinges common. 
\v 33 And with great power gaue the Apostles witnes of the resurrection of the Lord Iesus: and great grace was vpon them all. 
\v 34 Neither was there any among them, that lacked: for as many as were possessours of landes or houses, solde them, and brought the price of the things that were solde, 
\v 35 And layde it downe at the Apostles feete, and it was distributed vnto euery man, according as he had neede. 
\v 36 Also Ioses which was called of the Apostles, Barnabas (that is by interpretation the sonne of consolation) being a Leuite, and of the countrey of Cyprus, 
\v 37 Where as he had land, solde it, and brought the money, and laid it downe at the Apostles feete. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 But a certaine man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, solde a possession, 
\v 2 And kept away part of the price, his wife also being of counsell, and brought a certaine part, and layde it downe at the Apostles feete. 
\v 3 Then saide Peter, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart, that thou shouldest lye vnto the holy Ghost, and keepe away part of the price of this possession? 
\v 4 Whiles it remained, appertained it not vnto thee? and after it was solde, was it not in thine owne power? howe is it that thou hast conceiued this thing in thine heart? thou hast not lyed vnto men, but vnto God. 
\v 5 Now when Ananias heard these wordes, he fell downe, and gaue vp the ghost. Then great feare came on all them that heard these things. 
\v 6 And the yong men rose vp, and tooke him vp, and caried him out, and buried him. 
\v 7 And it came to passe about the space of three houres after, that his wife came in, ignorant of that which was done. 
\v 8 And Peter sayd vnto her, Tell me, solde ye the land for so much? And she sayd, Yea, for so much. 
\v 9 Then Peter sayde vnto her, Why haue ye agreed together, to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? beholde, the feete of them which haue buried thine husband, are at the doore, and shall carie thee out. 
\v 10 Then she fell downe straightway at his feete, and yeelded vp the ghost: and the yong men came in, and found her dead, and caried her out, and buried her by her husband. 
\v 11 And great feare came on all the Church, and on as many as heard these things. 
\v 12 Thus by the hands of the Apostles were many signes and wonders shewed among the people (and they were all with one accorde in Salomons porche. 
\v 13 And of the other durst no man ioyne him selfe to them: neuerthelesse the people magnified them. 
\v 14 Also the number of them that beleeued in the Lord, both of men and women, grewe more and more) 
\v 15 In so much that they brought the sicke into the streetes, and layd them on beds and couches, that at the least way the shadowe of Peter, when he came by, might shadow some of them. 
\v 16 There came also a multitude out of the cities round about vnto Hierusalem, bringing sicke folkes, and them which were vexed with vncleane spirits, who were all healed. 
\v 17 Then the chiefe Priest rose vp, and all they that were with him (which was the sect of the Sadduces) and were full of indignation, 
\v 18 And laide hands on the Apostles, and put them in the common prison. 
\v 19 But the Angel of the Lord, by night opened the prison doores, and brought them forth, and sayd, 
\v 20 Go your way, and stand in the Temple, and speake to the people, all the wordes of this life. 
\v 21 So when they heard it, they entred into the Temple early in the morning, and taught. And the chiefe Priest came, and they that were with him, and called the Councill together, and all the Elders of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison, to cause them to be brought. 
\v 22 But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned and tolde it, 
\v 23 Saying, Certainely we founde the prison shut as sure as was possible, and the keepers standing without, before the doores: but when we had opened, we found no man within. 
\v 24 Then when the chiefe Priest, and the captaine of the Temple, and the hie Priestes heard these things, they doubted of them, whereunto this would growe. 
\v 25 Then came one and shewed them, saying, Beholde, the men that ye put in prison, are standing in the Temple, and teach the people. 
\v 26 Then went the captaine with the officers, and brought them without violence (for they feared the people, lest they should haue bene stoned) 
\v 27 And when they had brought them, they set them before the Councill, and the chiefe Priest asked them, 
\v 28 Saying, Did not we straightly commaund you, that ye should not teach in this Name? and behold, ye haue filled Hierusale with your doctrine, and ye would bring this mans blood vpon vs. 
\v 29 Then Peter and the Apostles answered, and sayd, We ought rather to obey God then men. 
\v 30 The God of our fathers hath raised vp Iesus, whom ye slewe, and hanged on a tree. 
\v 31 Him hath God lift vp with his right hand, to be a Prince and a Sauiour, to giue repentance to Israel, and forgiuenes of sinnes. 
\v 32 And we are his witnesses concerning these things which we say: yea, and the holy Ghost, whome God hath giuen to them that obey him. 
\v 33 Now when they heard it, they brast for anger, and consulted to slay them. 
\v 34 Then stoode there vp in the Councill a certaine Pharise named Gamaliel, a doctour of the Lawe, honoured of all the people, and commanded to put the Apostles forth a litle space, 
\v 35 And sayd vnto them, Men of Israel, take heede to your selues, what ye intende to doe touching these men. 
\v 36 For before these times, rose vp Theudas boasting himselfe, to whom resorted a number of men, about a foure hundreth, who was slaine: and they all which obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought. 
\v 37 After this man, arose vp Iudas of Galile, in the dayes of the tribute, and drewe away much people after him: hee also perished, and all that obeyed him, were scattered abroad. 
\v 38 And nowe I say vnto you, Refraine your selues from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsell, or this worke be of men, it will come to nought: 
\v 39 But if it be of God, ye can not destroy it, lest ye be found euen fighters against God. 
\v 40 And to him they agreed, and called the Apostles: and when they had beaten them, they commanded that they should not speake in the Name of Iesus, and let them goe. 
\v 41 So they departed from the Councill, reioycing, that they were counted worthy to suffer rebuke for his Name. 
\v 42 And dayly in the Temple, and from house to house they ceased not to teach, and preach Iesus Christ. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1 And in those dayes, as the nomber of ye disciples grewe, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians towards ye Hebrewes, because their widowes were neglected in the dayly ministring. 
\v 2 Then the twelue called the multitude of the disciples together, and sayd, It is not meete that we should leaue the worde of God to serue the tables. 
\v 3 Wherefore brethren, looke ye out among you seuen men of honest report, and full of the holy Ghost, and of wisedome, which we may appoint to this busines. 
\v 4 And we will giue our selues continually to prayer, and to the ministration of the worde. 
\v 5 And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Steuen a man full of fayth and of the holy Ghost, and Philippe, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a Proselyte of Antiochia, 
\v 6 Which they set before the Apostles: and they prayed, and layed their hands on them. 
\v 7 And the worde of God increased, and the nomber of the disciples was multipled in Hierusalem greatly, and a great company of the Priests were obedient to the faith. 
\v 8 Now Steuen full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people. 
\v 9 Then there arose certaine of the Synagogue, which are called Libertines, and Cyrenians, and of Alexandria, and of them of Cilicia, and of Asia, and disputed with Steuen. 
\v 10 But they were not able to resist the wisdome, and the Spirit by the which he spake. 
\v 11 Then they suborned men, which saide, We haue heard him speake blasphemous wordes against Moses, and God. 
\v 12 Thus they mooued the people and the Elders, and the Scribes: and running vpon him, caught him, and brought him to the Councill, 
\v 13 And set forth false witnesses, which sayd, This man ceasseth not to speake blasphemous wordes against this holy place, and the Law. 
\v 14 For we haue heard him say, that this Iesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the ordinances, which Moses gaue vs. 
\v 15 And as all that sate in the Councill, looked stedfastly on him, they saw his face as it had bene the face of an Angel. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1 Then sayd the chiefe Priest, Are these things so? 
\v 2 And he sayd, Ye men, brethren and Fathers, hearken. That God of glory appeared vnto our father Abraham, while he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran, 
\v 3 And said vnto him, Come out of thy countrey, and from thy kindred, and come into the land, which I shall shewe thee. 
\v 4 Then came he out of the land of the Chaldeans, and dwelt in Charran. And after that his father was dead, God brought him from thence into this land, wherein ye now dwell, 
\v 5 And hee gaue him none inheritance in it, no, not the bredth of a foote: yet he promised that he would giue it to him for a possession, and to his seede after him, when as yet hee had no childe. 
\v 6 But God spake thus, that his seede should be a soiourner in a strange land: and that they should keepe it in bondage, and entreate it euill foure hundreth yeeres. 
\v 7 But the nation to whome they shall be in bondage, will I iudge, sayth God: and after that, they shall come forth and serue me in this place. 
\v 8 Hee gaue him also the couenant of circumcision: and so Abraham begate Isaac, and circumcised him the eight day: and Isaac begate Iacob, and Iacob the twelue Patriarkes. 
\v 9 And the Patriarkes moued with enuie, solde Ioseph into Egypt: but God was with him, 
\v 10 And deliuered him out of all his afflictions, and gaue him fauour and wisdome in the sight of Pharao King of Egypt, who made him gouernour ouer Egypt, and ouer his whole house. 
\v 11 Then came there a famine ouer all the land of Egypt and Chanaan, and great affliction, that our fathers found no sustenance. 
\v 12 But when Iacob heard that there was corne in Egypt, he sent our fathers first: 
\v 13 And at the second time, Ioseph was knowen of his brethren, and Iosephs kindred was made knowen vnto Pharao. 
\v 14 Then sent Ioseph and caused his father to be brought, and all his kindred, euen threescore and fifteene soules. 
\v 15 So Iacob went downe into Egypt, and he dyed, and our fathers, 
\v 16 And were remoued into Sychem, and were put in the sepulchre, that Abraham had bought for money of the sonnes of Emor, sonne of Sychem. 
\v 17 But when the time of the promise drewe neere, which God had sworne to Abraham, the people grewe and multiplied in Egypt, 
\v 18 Till another King arose, which knewe not Ioseph. 
\v 19 The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and euill entreated our fathers, and made them to cast out their yong children, that they should not remaine aliue. 
\v 20 The same time was Moses borne, and was acceptable vnto God, which was nourished vp in his fathers house three moneths. 
\v 21 And when he was cast out, Pharaohs daughter tooke him vp, and nourished him for her owne sonne. 
\v 22 And Moses was learned in all the wisdome of the Egyptians, and was mightie in wordes and in deedes. 
\v 23 Nowe when he was full fourtie yeere olde, it came into his heart to visite his brethren, the children of Israel. 
\v 24 And whe he saw one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and auenged his quarell that had the harme done to him, and smote the Egyptian. 
\v 25 For hee supposed his brethren would haue vnderstand, that God by his hande should giue them deliuerance: but they vnderstoode it not. 
\v 26 And the next day, he shewed himselfe vnto them as they stroue, and woulde haue set them at one againe, saying, Syrs, ye are brethren: why doe ye wrong one to another? 
\v 27 But he that did his neighbour wrong, thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a prince, and a iudge ouer vs? 
\v 28 Wilt thou kill mee, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday? 
\v 29 Then fled Moses at that saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begate two sonnes. 
\v 30 And when fourtie yeres were expired, there appeared to him in the wildernes of mout Sina, an Angel of the Lord in a flame of fire, in a bush. 
\v 31 And when Moses sawe it, hee wondred at the sight: and as he drew neere to consider it, the voyce of the Lord came vnto him, saying, 
\v 32 I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Iacob. Then Moses trembled, and durst not behold it. 
\v 33 Then the Lord said to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feete: for the place where thou standest, is holy ground. 
\v 34 I haue seene, I haue seene the affliction of my people, which is in Egypt, and I haue heard their groning, and am come downe to deliuer them: and nowe come, and I will sende thee into Egypt. 
\v 35 This Moses whome they forsooke, saying, Who made thee a prince and a iudge? the same God sent for a prince, and a deliuerer by the hand of the Angel, which appeared to him in the bush. 
\v 36 Hee brought them out, doing wonders, and miracles in the land of Egypt, and in the red sea, and in the wildernes fourtie yeeres. 
\v 37 This is that Moses, which saide vnto the children of Israel, A Prophet shall the Lord your God raise vp vnto you, euen of your brethren, like vnto me: him shall ye heare. 
\v 38 This is he that was in the Congregation, in the wildernes with the Angell, which spake to him in mount Sina, and with our fathers, who receiued the liuely oracles to giue vnto vs. 
\v 39 To whom our fathers would not obey, but refused, and in their hearts turned backe againe into Egypt: 
\v 40 Saying vnto Aaron, Make vs gods that may goe before vs: for we knowe not what is become of this Moses that brought vs out of the land of Egypt. 
\v 41 And they made a calfe in those dayes, and offered sacrifice vnto the idole, and reioyced in the workes of their owne handes. 
\v 42 Then God turned himselfe away, and gaue them vp to serue the host of heauen, as it is written in the booke of the Prophets, O house of Israel, haue ye offred to me slaine beasts and sacrifices by the space of fourtie yeres in the wildernes? 
\v 43 And ye tooke vp the tabernacle of Moloch, and the starre of your god Remphan, figures, which ye made to worship them: therefore I will carie you away beyond Babylon. 
\v 44 Our fathers had the tabernacle of witnes, in the wildernes, as hee had appointed, speaking vnto Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seene. 
\v 45 Which tabernacle also our fathers receiued, and brought in with Iesus into the possession of the Gentiles, which God draue out before our fathers, vnto the dayes of Dauid: 
\v 46 Who found fauour before God, and desired that hee might finde a tabernacle for the God of Iacob. 
\v 47 But Salomon built him an house. 
\v 48 Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with handes, as saith the Prophet, 
\v 49 Heauen is my throne, and earth is my footestoole: what house wil ye build for me, saith the Lord? or what place is it that I should rest in? 
\v 50 Hath not mine hand made all these things? 
\v 51 Ye stiffenecked and of vncircumcised heartes and eares, ye haue alwayes resisted the holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do you. 
\v 52 Which of the Prophets haue not your fathers persecuted? and they haue slaine them, which shewed before of the comming of that Iust, of whome ye are now the betrayers and murtherers, 
\v 53 Which haue receiued the Lawe by the ordinance of Angels, and haue not kept it. 
\v 54 But when they heard these thinges, their heartes brast for anger, and they gnashed at him with their teeth. 
\v 55 But he being full of the holy Ghost, looked stedfastly into heauen, and sawe the glory of God, and Iesus standing at the right hand of God, 
\v 56 And said, Beholde, I see the heauens open, and the Sonne of man standing at the right hand of God. 
\v 57 Then they gaue a shoute with a loude voyce, and stopped their eares, and ranne vpon him violently all at once, 
\v 58 And cast him out of the citie, and stoned him: and the witnesses layd downe their clothes at a yong mans feete, named Saul. 
\v 59 And they stoned Steuen, who called on God, and said, Lord Iesus, receiue my spirit. 
\v 60 And he kneeled downe, and cried with a loude voyce, Lord, laye not this sinne to their charge. And when he had thus spoken, he slept. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1 And Saul consented to his death, and at that time, there was a great persecution against the Church which was at Hierusalem, and they were all scattered abroad thorowe the regions of Iudea and of Samaria, except the Apostles. 
\v 2 Then certaine men fearing God, caried Steuen amongs them, to be buried, and made great lamentation for him. 
\v 3 But Saul made hauocke of the Church, and entred into euery house, and drewe out both men and women, and put them into prison. 
\v 4 Therefore they that were scattered abroad, went to and from preaching the worde. 
\v 5 Then came Philip into the citie of Samaria, and preached Christ vnto them. 
\v 6 And the people gaue heed vnto those things which Philippe spake, with one accorde, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did. 
\v 7 For vncleane spirits crying with a loud voyce, came out of many that were possessed of them: and many taken with palsies, and that halted, were healed. 
\v 8 And there was great ioy in that citie. 
\v 9 And there was before in the citie a certaine man called Simon, which vsed witchcraft, and bewitched the people of Samaria, saying that he himselfe was some great man. 
\v 10 To whome they gaue heede from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is that great power of God. 
\v 11 And they gaue heed vnto him, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries. 
\v 12 But assoone as they beleeued Philip, which preached the thinges that concerned the kingdome of God, and the Name of Iesus Christ, they were baptized both men and women. 
\v 13 Then Simon himselfe beleeued also and was baptized, and continued with Philippe, and wondred, when he sawe the signes and great miracles which were done. 
\v 14 Nowe when the Apostles, which were at Hierusalem, heard say, that Samaria had receiued the worde of God, they sent vnto them Peter and Iohn. 
\v 15 Which whe they were come downe, prayed for them, that they might receiue the holy Ghost. 
\v 16 (For as yet, hee was fallen downe on none of them, but they were baptized onely in the Name of the Lord Iesus.) 
\v 17 Then layd they their handes on them, and they receiued the holy Ghost. 
\v 18 And when Simon sawe, that through laying on of the Apostles hands the holy Ghost was giuen, he offred them money, 
\v 19 Saying, Giue mee also this power, that on whomsoeuer I lay the handes, he may receiue the holy Ghost. 
\v 20 Then saide Peter vnto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou thinkest that the gift of God may be obteined with money. 
\v 21 Thou hast neither part nor fellowship in this businesse: for thine heart is not right in the sight of God. 
\v 22 Repent therefore of this thy wickednes, and pray God, that if it be possible, the thought of thine heart may be forgiuen thee. 
\v 23 For I see that thou art in the gall of bitternes, and in the bonde of iniquitie. 
\v 24 Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye haue spoken, come vpon me. 
\v 25 So they, when they had testified and preached the worde of the Lord, returned to Hierusalem, and preached the Gospel in many townes of the Samaritans. 
\v 26 Then the Angel of the Lord spake vnto Philip, saying, Arise, and goe towarde the South vnto the way that goeth downe from Hierusalem vnto Gaza, which is waste. 
\v 27 And hee arose and went on: and beholde, a certaine Eunuche of Ethiopia, Candaces the Queene of the Ethiopians chiefe Gouernour, who had the rule of all her treasure, and came to Hierusalem to worship: 
\v 28 And as he returned sitting in his charet, he read Esaias the Prophet. 
\v 29 Then the Spirit said vnto Philip, Goe neere and ioyne thy selfe to yonder charet. 
\v 30 And Philip ranne thither, and heard him reade the Prophet Esaias, and said, But vnderstandest thou what thou readest? 
\v 31 And he saide, Howe can I, except I had a guide? And he desired Philip, that he would come vp and sit with him. 
\v 32 Nowe the place of the Scripture which he read, was this, Hee was lead as a sheepe to the slaughter: and like a lambe domme before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth. 
\v 33 In his humilitie his iudgement hath bene exalted: but who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth. 
\v 34 Then the Eunuche answered Philippe, and saide, I pray thee of whome speaketh the Prophet this? of himselfe, or of some other man? 
\v 35 Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same Scripture, and preached vnto him Iesus. 
\v 36 And as they went on their way, they came vnto a certaine water, and the Eunuche said, See, here is water: what doeth let me to be baptized? 
\v 37 And Philippe said vnto him, If thou beleeuest with all thine heart, thou mayest. Then he answered, and saide, I beleeue that that Iesus Christ is that Sonne of God. 
\v 38 Then he commanded the charet to stand stil: and they went downe both into the water, both Philip and the Eunuche, and he baptized him. 
\v 39 And assoone as they were come vp out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the Eunuche sawe him no more: so he went on his way reioycing. 
\v 40 But Philippe was found at Azotus, and he walked to and from preaching in all the cities, till he came to Cesarea. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 And Saul yet breathing out threatnings and slaughter against the disciples of ye Lord, went vnto the hie Priest, 
\v 2 And desired of him letters to Damascus to the Synagogues, that if he found any that were of that way (either men or women) hee might bring them bound vnto Hierusalem. 
\v 3 Now as he iourneyed, it came to passe that as he was come neere to Damascus, suddenly there shined rounde about him a light from heauen. 
\v 4 And hee fell to the earth, and heard a voyce, saying to him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? 
\v 5 And he sayd, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord sayd, I am Iesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kicke against pricks. 
\v 6 He then both trembling and astonied, sayd, Lord, what wilt thou that I doe? And the Lord sayd vnto him, Arise and goe into the citie, and it shall be tolde thee what thou shalt doe. 
\v 7 The men also which iourneyed with him, stood amased, hearing his voyce, but seeing no man. 
\v 8 And Saul arose from the ground, and opened his eyes, but sawe no man. Then led they him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus, 
\v 9 Where he was three dayes without sight, and neither ate nor dranke. 
\v 10 And there was a certaine disciple at Damascus named Ananias, and to him sayd the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he sayd, Beholde, I am here Lord. 
\v 11 Then the Lord sayd vnto him, Arise, and goe into the streete which is called Straight, and seeke in the house of Iudas after one called Saul of Tarsus: for beholde, he prayeth. 
\v 12 (And he sawe in a vision a man named Ananias comming in to him, and putting his hands on him, that he might receiue his sight.) 
\v 13 Then Ananias answered, Lord, I haue heard by many of this man, howe much euill hee hath done to thy saints at Hierusalem. 
\v 14 Moreouer here hee hath authoritie of the hie Priestes, to binde all that call on thy Name. 
\v 15 Then the Lord said vnto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessell vnto me, to beare my Name before the Gentiles, and Kings, and the children of Israel. 
\v 16 For I will shewe him, howe many things he must suffer for my Names sake. 
\v 17 Then Ananias went his way, and entred into that house, and put his hands on him, and sayd, Brother Saul, the Lord hath sent me (euen Iesus that appeared vnto thee in the way as thou camest) that thou mightest receiue thy sight, and be filled with the holy Ghost. 
\v 18 And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had bene scales, and suddenly he receiued sight, and arose, and was baptized, 
\v 19 And receiued meate, and was strengthened. So was Saul certaine dayes with the disciples which were at Damascus. 
\v 20 And straightway hee preached Christ in the Synagogues, that he was that Sonne of God, 
\v 21 So that all that heard him, were amased, and sayde, Is not this hee, that made hauocke of them which called on this Name in Hierusalem, and came hither for that intent, that hee should bring them bound vnto the hie Priests? 
\v 22 But Saul encreased the more in strength, and confounded the Iewes which dwelt at Damascus, confirming, that this was that Christ. 
\v 23 And after that many dayes were fulfilled, the Iewes tooke counsell together, to kill him, 
\v 24 But their laying awayte was knowen of Saul: nowe they watched the gates day and night, that they might kill him. 
\v 25 Then the disciples tooke him by night, and put him through the wall, and let him downe by a rope in a basket. 
\v 26 And when Saul was come to Hierusalem, he assayed to ioyne himselfe with the disciples: but they were all afrayd of him, and beleeued not that he was a disciple. 
\v 27 But Barnabas tooke him, and brought him to the Apostles, and declared to them, howe hee had seene the Lord in the way, and that hee had spoken vnto him, and how he had spoken boldly at Damascus in the Name of Iesus. 
\v 28 And hee was conuersant with them at Hierusalem, 
\v 29 And spake boldly in the Name of the Lord Iesus, and spake and disputed against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him. 
\v 30 But when the brethren knewe it, they brought him to Cesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus. 
\v 31 Then had the Churches rest through all Iudea, and Galile, and Samaria, and were edified and walked in the feare of the Lord, and were multiplied by the comfort of the holy Ghost. 
\v 32 And it came to passe, as Peter walked throughout all quarters, hee came also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda. 
\v 33 And there he found a certaine man named Aeneas, which had kept his couch eight yeeres, and was sicke of the palsie. 
\v 34 Then said Peter vnto him, Aeneas, Iesus Christ maketh thee whole: arise and trusse thy couch together. And he arose immediately. 
\v 35 And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron, sawe him, and turned to the Lord. 
\v 36 There was also at Ioppa a certaine woman, a disciple named Tabitha (which by interpretation is called Dorcas) she was full of good workes and almes which she did. 
\v 37 And it came to passe in those dayes, that she was sicke and dyed: and when they had washed her, they layd her in an vpper chamber. 
\v 38 Now forasmuch as Lydda was neere to Ioppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent vnto him two men, desiring that he would not delay to come vnto them. 
\v 39 Then Peter arose and came with them: and when hee was come, they brought him into the vpper chamber, where all the widowes stoode by him weeping, and shewing the coates and garments, which Dorcas made, while she was with them. 
\v 40 But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled downe, and prayed, and turned him to the body, and sayd, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes, and when she sawe Peter, sate vp. 
\v 41 Then he gaue her the hand and lift her vp, and called the Saints and widowes, and restored her aliue. 
\v 42 And it was knowen throughout all Ioppa, and many beleeued in the Lord. 
\v 43 And it came to passe that he taried many dayes in Ioppa with one Simon a Tanner. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1 Futhermore there was a certaine man in Cesarea called Cornelius, a captaine of the band called the Italian band, 
\v 2 A deuoute man, and one that feared God with all his housholde, which gaue much almes to the people, and prayed God continually. 
\v 3 He sawe in a vision euidently (about the ninth houre of the day) an Angel of God comming in to him, and saying vnto him, Cornelius. 
\v 4 But when hee looked on him, hee was afrayd, and sayd, What is it, Lord? and he sayd vnto him, Thy prayers and thine almes are come vp into remembrance before God. 
\v 5 Nowe therefore send men to Ioppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter. 
\v 6 Hee lodgeth with one Simon a Tanner, whose house is by the sea side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to doe. 
\v 7 And when the Angel which spake vnto Cornelius, was departed, he called two of his seruants, and a souldier that feared God, one of them that waited on him, 
\v 8 And tolde them all things, and sent them to Ioppa. 
\v 9 On the morow as they went on their iourney, and drew neere vnto the citie, Peter went vp vpon the house to pray, about the sixt houre. 
\v 10 Then waxed hee an hungred, and would haue eaten: but while they made some thing ready, he fell into a trance. 
\v 11 And hee sawe heauen opened, and a certaine vessell come downe vnto him, as it had bene a great sheete, knit at the foure corners, and was let downe to the earth. 
\v 12 Wherein were all maner of foure footed beastes of the earth, and wilde beastes and creeping things, and foules of the heauen. 
\v 13 And there came a voyce to him, Arise, Peter: kill, and eate. 
\v 14 But Peter sayd, Not so, Lord: for I haue neuer eaten any thing that is polluted, or vncleane. 
\v 15 And the voyce spake vnto him againe the second time, The things that God hath purified, pollute thou not. 
\v 16 This was so done thrise: and the vessell was drawen vp againe into heauen. 
\v 17 Nowe while Peter douted in himselfe what this vision which he had seene, meant, beholde, the men which were sent from Cornelius, had inquired for Simons house, and stoode at the gate, 
\v 18 And called, and asked, whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there. 
\v 19 And while Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit sayde vnto him, Beholde, three men seeke thee. 
\v 20 Arise therefore, and get thee downe, and goe with them, and doute nothing: For I haue sent them. 
\v 21 Then Peter went downe to the men, which were sent vnto him from Cornelius, and sayd, Beholde, I am he whome ye seeke: what is the cause wherefore ye are come? 
\v 22 And they sayd, Cornelius the captaine, a iust man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Iewes, was warned from heauen by an holy Angel, to send for thee into his house, and to heare thy wordes. 
\v 23 Then called he them in, and lodged them, and the next day, Peter went foorth with them, and certaine brethren from Ioppa accompanied him. 
\v 24 And the day after, they entred into Cesarea. Nowe Cornelius waited for them, and had called together his kinsemen, and special friends. 
\v 25 And it came to passe as Peter came in, that Cornelius met him, and fell downe at his feete, and worshipped him. 
\v 26 But Peter tooke him vp, saying, Stand vp: for euen I my selfe am a man. 
\v 27 And as he talked with him, he came in, and found many that were come together. 
\v 28 And he sayd vnto them, Ye know that it is an vnlawfull thing for a man that is a Iewe, to company, or come vnto one of another nation: but God hath shewed me, that I should not call any man polluted, or vncleane. 
\v 29 Therefore came I vnto you without saying nay, when I was sent for. I aske therefore, for what intent haue ye sent for me? 
\v 30 Then Cornelius sayd, Foure dayes agoe, about this houre, I fasted, and at the ninth houre I prayed in mine house, and beholde, a man stood before me in bright clothing, 
\v 31 And sayd, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine almes are had in remembrance in the sight of God. 
\v 32 Send therefore to Ioppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter (he is lodged in the house of Simon a Tanner by the sea side) who when he commeth, shall speake vnto thee. 
\v 33 Then sent I for thee immediately, and thou hast well done to come. Nowe therefore are we all here present before God, to heare all things that are commanded thee of God. 
\v 34 Then Peter opened his mouth, and sayd, Of a trueth I perceiue, that God is no accepter of persons. 
\v 35 But in euery nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousnesse, is accepted with him. 
\v 36 Ye know the worde which God hath sent to the children of Israel, preaching peace by Iesus Christ, which is Lord of all: 
\v 37 Euen the worde which came through all Iudea, beginning in Galile, after the baptisme which Iohn preached. 
\v 38 To wit, howe God anointed Iesus of Nazareth with the holy Ghost, and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the deuill: for God was with him. 
\v 39 And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Iewes, and in Hierusalem, whom they slewe, hanging him on a tree. 
\v 40 Him God raysed vp the third day, and caused that he was shewed openly: 
\v 41 Not to all the people, but vnto the witnesses chosen before of God, euen to vs which did eate and drinke with him, after he arose from the dead. 
\v 42 And he commanded vs to preach vnto the people, and to testifie, that it is he that is ordained of God a iudge of quicke and dead. 
\v 43 To him also giue all the Prophets witnesse, that through his Name all that beleeue in him, shall receiue remission of sinnes. 
\v 44 While Peter yet spake these wordes, the holy Ghost fell on al them which heard the word. 
\v 45 So they of the circumcision which beleeued, were astonied, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was powred out the gift of the holy Ghost. 
\v 46 For they heard them speake with tongues, and magnifie God. Then answered Peter, 
\v 47 Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which haue receiued the holy Ghost, as well as we? 
\v 48 So he commanded them to be baptized in the Name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tary certaine dayes. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 Nowe the Apostles and the brethren that were in Iudea, heard, that the Gentiles had also receiued the worde of God. 
\v 2 And when Peter was come vp to Hierusalem, they of the circumcision contended against him, 
\v 3 Saying, Thou wentest in to men vncircumcised, and hast eaten with them. 
\v 4 Then Peter beganne, and expounded the thing in order to them, saying, 
\v 5 I was in the citie of Ioppa, praying, and in a trance I sawe this vision, A certaine vessell comming downe as it had bene a great sheete, let downe from heauen by the foure corners, and it came to me. 
\v 6 Towarde the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and sawe foure footed beastes of the earth, and wilde beastes, and creeping things, and foules of the heauen. 
\v 7 Also I heard a voyce, saying vnto me, Arise, Peter: slay and eate. 
\v 8 And I said, God forbid, Lord: for nothing polluted or vncleane hath at any time entred into my mouth. 
\v 9 But the voyce answered me the seconde time from heauen, The things that God hath purified, pollute thou not. 
\v 10 And this was done three times, and all were taken vp againe into heauen. 
\v 11 Then behold, immediatly there were three men already come vnto the house where I was, sent from Cesarea vnto me. 
\v 12 And the Spirit saide vnto me, that I should go with them, without doubting: moreouer these sixe brethren came with me, and we entred into the mans house. 
\v 13 And he shewed vs, howe he had seene an Angel in his house, which stoode and said to him, Send men to Ioppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter. 
\v 14 He shall speake wordes vnto thee, whereby both thou and all thine house shalbe saued. 
\v 15 And as I began to speake, the holy Ghost fell on them, euen as vpon vs at the beginning. 
\v 16 Then I remembred the word of the Lord, howe he said, Iohn baptized with water, but ye shalbe baptized with the holy Ghost. 
\v 17 For as much then as God gaue them a like gift, as he did vnto vs, when we beleeued in the Lord Iesus Christ, who was I, that I coulde let God? 
\v 18 When they heard these things, they helde their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles graunted repentance vnto life. 
\v 19 And they which were scattered abroade because of the affliction that arose about Steuen, went throughout till they came vnto Phenice and Cyprus, and Antiochia, preaching the worde to no man, but vnto the Iewes onely. 
\v 20 Now some of them were men of Cyprus and of Cyrene, which when they were come into Antiochia, spake vnto the Grecians, and preached the Lord Iesus. 
\v 21 And the hand of the Lord was with them, so that a great number beleeued and turned vnto the Lord. 
\v 22 Then tydings of those things came vnto the eares of the Church, which was in Hierusalem, and they sent foorth Barnabas, that he should goe vnto Antiochia. 
\v 23 Who when he was come and had seene the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted all, that with purpose of heart they would continue in the Lord. 
\v 24 For he was a good man, and full of the holy Ghost, and faith, and much people ioyned them selues vnto the Lord. 
\v 25 Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus to seeke Saul: 
\v 26 And when he had founde him, he brought him vnto Antiochia: and it came to passe that a whole yere they were conuersant with ye Church, and taught much people, in so much that the disciples were first called Christians in Antiochia. 
\v 27 In those dayes also came Prophets from Hierusalem vnto Antiochia. 
\v 28 And there stoode vp one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit, that there should be great famine throughout all the world, which also came to passe vnder Claudius Cesar. 
\v 29 Then the disciples, euery man according to his ability, purposed to sende succour vnto the brethren which dwelt in Iudea. 
\v 30 Which thing they also did, and sent it to the Elders, by the hand of Barnabas and Saul. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 Nowe about that time, Herod the King stretched forth his hands to vexe certaine of the Church, 
\v 2 And he killed Iames the brother of Iohn with the sword. 
\v 3 And when he sawe that it pleased the Iewes, he proceeded further, to take Peter also (then were the dayes of vnleauened bread.) 
\v 4 And when he had caught him, he put him in prison, and deliuered him to foure quaternions of souldiers to be kept, intending after the Passeouer to bring him foorth to the people. 
\v 5 So Peter was kept in prison, but earnest prayer was made of ye Church vnto God for him. 
\v 6 And when Herod woulde haue brought him out vnto the people, the same night slept Peter betweene two souldiers, bound with two chaines, and the keepers before the doore, kept the prison. 
\v 7 And behold the Angel of the Lord came vpon them, and a light shined in the house, and he smote Peter on the side, and raysed him vp, saying, Arise quickely. And his chaines fell off from his handes. 
\v 8 And the Angel saide vnto him, Girde thy selfe, and binde on thy sandales. And so he did. Then he said vnto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me. 
\v 9 So Peter came out and followed him, and knewe not that it was true, which was done by the Angel, but thought he had seene a vision. 
\v 10 Nowe when they were past the first and the second watch, they came vnto the yron gate, that leadeth vnto the citie, which opened to them by it owne accord, and they went out, and passed through one streete, and by and by the Angel departed from him. 
\v 11 And when Peter was come to himselfe, he said, Nowe I know for a trueth, that the Lord hath sent his Angel, and hath deliuered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the wayting for of the people of the Iewes. 
\v 12 And as he considered the thing, he came to the house of Marie, the mother of Iohn, whose surname was Marke, where many were gathered together, and prayed. 
\v 13 And when Peter knocked at the entrie doore, a maide came foorth to hearken, named Rhode, 
\v 14 But when she knew Peters voyce, she opened not the entrie doore for gladnesse, but ranne in, and tolde howe Peter stood before the entrie. 
\v 15 But they said vnto her, Thou art mad. Yet she affirmed it constantly, that it was so. Then said they, It is his Angel. 
\v 16 But Peter continued knocking, and when they had opened it, and sawe him, they were astonied. 
\v 17 And he beckened vnto them with the hand, to hold their peace, and told them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he saide, Goe shewe these things vnto Iames and to the brethren: and he departed and went into an other place. 
\v 18 Nowe assoone as it was day, there was no small trouble among the souldiers, what was become of Peter. 
\v 19 And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the keepers, and commanded them to be led to be punished. And he went downe from Iudea to Cesarea, and there abode. 
\v 20 Then Herod was angrie with them of Tyrus and Sidon, but they came all with one accord vnto him, and perswaded Blastus the Kings Chamberlaine, and they desired peace, because their countrey was nourished by the Kings land. 
\v 21 And vpon a day appointed, Herod arayed himselfe in royall apparell, and sate on the iudgement seate, and made an oration vnto them. 
\v 22 And the people gaue a shoute, saying, The voyce of God, and not of man. 
\v 23 But immediatly the Angel of the Lord smote him, because he gaue not glorie vnto God, so that he was eaten of wormes, and gaue vp the ghost. 
\v 24 And the worde of God grewe, and multiplied. 
\v 25 So Barnabas and Saul returned from Hierusalem, when they had fulfilled their office, and tooke with them Iohn, whose surname was Marke. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 There were also in the Church that was at Antiochia, certaine Prophets and teachers, as Barnabas, and Simeon called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manahen (which had bin brought vp with Herod the Tetrarche) and Saul. 
\v 2 Nowe as they ministred to the Lord, and fasted, the holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul, for the worke whereunto I haue called them. 
\v 3 Then fasted they and prayed, and layde their hands on them, and let them goe. 
\v 4 And they, after they were sent foorth of the holy Ghost, came downe vnto Seleucia, and from thence they sayled to Cyprus. 
\v 5 And when they were at Salamis, they preached the worde of God in the Synagogues of the Iewes: and they had also Iohn to their minister. 
\v 6 So when they had gone throughout the yle vnto Paphus, they found a certaine sorcerer, a false prophet, being a Iewe, named Bariesus, 
\v 7 Which was with the Deputie Sergius Paulus, a prudent man. He called vnto him Barnabas and Saul, and desired to heare the woorde of God. 
\v 8 But Elymas, ye sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstoode them, and sought to turne away the Deputie from the faith. 
\v 9 Then Saul (which also is called Paul) being full of the holy Ghost, set his eyes on him, 
\v 10 And sayde, O full of all subtiltie and all mischiefe, the childe of the deuill, and enemie of all righteousnesse, wilt thou not cease to peruert the straight waies of the Lord? 
\v 11 Nowe therefore behold, the hand of the Lord is vpon thee, and thou shalt be blinde, and not see the sunne for a season. And immediately there fel on him a mist and a darknes; and he went about, seeking some to leade him by the hand. 
\v 12 Then the Deputie when he sawe what was done, beleeued, and was astonied at the doctrine of the Lord. 
\v 13 Nowe when Paul and they that were with him were departed by shippe from Paphus, they came to Perga a citie of Pamphylia: then Iohn departed from them, and returned to Hierusalem. 
\v 14 But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antiochia a citie of Pisidia, and went into the Synagogue on ye Sabbath day, and sate downe. 
\v 15 And after the lecture of the Law and Prophets, the rulers of ye Synagogue sent vnto them, saying, Ye men and brethren, if ye haue any word of exhortation for the people, say on. 
\v 16 Then Paul stoode vp and beckened with the hand, and sayde, Men of Israel, and yee that feare God, hearken. 
\v 17 The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt in the land of Egypt, and with an high arme brought them out thereof. 
\v 18 And about the time of fourtie yeeres, suffered he their maners in the wildernesse. 
\v 19 And he destroied seuen nations in the land of Chanaan, and deuided their lad to them by lot. 
\v 20 Then afterward he gaue vnto them Iudges about foure hundreth and fiftie yeeres, vnto the time of Samuel the Prophet. 
\v 21 So after that, they desired a King, and God gaue vnto them Saul, the sonne of Cis, a man of ye tribe of Beniamin, by the space of fourty yeres. 
\v 22 And after he had taken him away, he raised vp Dauid to be their King, of whom he witnessed, saying, I haue found Dauid the sonne of Iesse, a man after mine owne heart, which will doe all things that I will. 
\v 23 Of this mans seede hath God according to his promise raised vp to Israel, ye Sauiour Iesus: 
\v 24 When Iohn had first preached before his coming the baptisme of repentance to all the people of Israel. 
\v 25 And when Iohn had fulfilled his course, he saide, Whom ye thinke that I am, I am not he: but beholde, there commeth one after me, whose shooe of his feete I am not worthy to loose. 
\v 26 Yee men and brethren, children of the generation of Abraham, and whosoeuer among you feareth God, to you is the woorde of this saluation sent. 
\v 27 For the inhabitants of Hierusalem, and their rulers, because they knewe him not, nor yet the woordes of the Prophets, which are read euery Sabbath day, they haue fulfilled them in condemning him. 
\v 28 And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilate to kill him. 
\v 29 And when they had fulfilled all things that were written of him, they tooke him downe from the tree, and put him in a sepulchre. 
\v 30 But God raised him vp from the dead. 
\v 31 And hee was seene many dayes of them, which came vp with him from Galile to Hierusalem, which are his witnesses vnto the people. 
\v 32 And we declare vnto you, that touching the promise made vnto the fathers, 
\v 33 God hath fulfilled it vnto vs their children, in that he raised vp Iesus, euen as it is written in the seconde Psalme, Thou art my Sonne: this day haue I begotten thee. 
\v 34 Nowe as concerning that he raised him vp from the dead, no more to returne to corruption, he hath said thus, I wil giue you the holy things of Dauid, which are faithfull. 
\v 35 Wherefore hee sayeth also in another place, Thou wilt not suffer thine Holy one to see corruption. 
\v 36 Howbeit, Dauid after hee had serued his time by the counsell of God, hee slept, and was laid with his fathers, and sawe corruption. 
\v 37 But he whom God raised vp, sawe no corruption. 
\v 38 Be it knowen vnto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached vnto you the forgiuenesse of sinnes. 
\v 39 And from al things, from which ye could not be iustified by the Law of Moses, by him euery one that beleeueth, is iustified. 
\v 40 Beware therefore lest that come vpon you, which is spoken of in the Prophets, 
\v 41 Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and vanish away: for I woorke a woorke in your daies, a woorke which yee shall not beleeue, if a man would declare it you. 
\v 42 And when they were come out of the Synagogue of the Iewes, the Gentiles besought, that they woulde preach these woordes to them the next Sabbath day. 
\v 43 Nowe when the congregation was dissolued, many of the Iewes and Proselytes that feared God, followed Paul and Barnabas, which spake to them, and exhorted them to continue in the grace of God. 
\v 44 And ye next Sabbath day came almost the whole citie together, to heare the worde of God. 
\v 45 But when the Iewes saw the people, they were full of enuie, and spake against those things, which were spoken of Paul, contrarying them, and railing on them. 
\v 46 Then Paul and Barnabas spake boldly, and sayde, It was necessarie that the woorde of God shoulde first haue beene spoken vnto you: but seeing yee put it from you, and iudge your selues vnworthie of euerlasting life, loe, we turne to the Gentiles. 
\v 47 For so hath the Lord commanded vs, saying, I haue made thee a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be the saluation vnto the end of the world. 
\v 48 And when the Gentiles heard it, they were glad, and glorified the woorde of the Lord: and as many as were ordeined vnto eternall life, beleeued. 
\v 49 Thus the worde of the Lord was published throughout the whole countrey. 
\v 50 But the Iewes stirred certaine deuoute and honourable women, and the chiefe men of the citie, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coastes. 
\v 51 But they shooke off the dust of their feete against them, and came vnto Iconium. 
\v 52 And the disciples were filled with ioy, and with the holy Ghost. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1 And it came to passe in Iconium, that they went both together into the Synagogue of the Iewes, and so spake, that a great multitude both of the Iewes and of the Grecians beleeued. 
\v 2 And the vnbeleeuing Iewes stirred vp, and corrupted the mindes of the Gentiles against the brethren. 
\v 3 So therefore they abode there a long time, and spake boldly in the Lord, which gaue testimonie vnto the woord of his grace, and caused signes and woders to be done by their hands. 
\v 4 But the multitude of the city was deuided: and some were with the Iewes, and some with the Apostles. 
\v 5 And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and of the Iewes with their rulers, to doe them violence, and to stone them, 
\v 6 They were ware of it, and fled vnto Lystra, and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and vnto the region round about, 
\v 7 And there preached the Gospel. 
\v 8 Nowe there sate a certaine man at Lystra, impotent in his feete, which was a creeple from his mothers wombe, who had neuer walked. 
\v 9 He heard Paul speake: who beholding him, and perceiuing that he had faith to be healed, 
\v 10 Said with a loude voyce, Stand vpright on thy feete. And he leaped vp, and walked. 
\v 11 Then when the people sawe what Paul had done, they lift vp their voyces, saying in ye speach of Lycaonia, Gods are come downe to vs in the likenesse of men. 
\v 12 And they called Barnabas, Iupiter: and Paul, Mercurius, because hee was the chiefe speaker. 
\v 13 Then Iupiters priest, which was before their citie, brought bulles with garlands vnto the gates, and would haue sacrificed with the people. 
\v 14 But when the Apostles, Barnabas and Paul heard it, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying, 
\v 15 And saying, O men, why doe yee these things? We are euen men subiect to the like passions that yee be, and preache vnto you, that yee shoulde turne from these vaine things vnto the liuing God, which made heauen and earth, and the sea, and all things that in them are: 
\v 16 Who in times past suffered all the Gentiles to walke in their owne waies. 
\v 17 Neuerthelesse, hee left not him selfe without witnes, in that hee did good and gaue vs raine from heauen, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with foode, and gladnesse. 
\v 18 And speaking these things, scarce appeased they the multitude, that they had not sacrificed vnto them. 
\v 19 Then there came certaine Iewes from Antiochia and Iconium, which when they had persuaded the people, stoned Paul, and drewe him out of the citie, supposing he had bene dead. 
\v 20 Howbeit, as the disciples stoode rounde about him, hee arose vp, and came into the citie, and the next day hee departed with Barnabas to Derbe. 
\v 21 And after they had preached the glad tidings of the Gospel to that citie, and had taught many, they returned to Lystra, and to Iconium, and to Antiochia, 
\v 22 Confirming the disciples hearts, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, affirming that we must through many afflictions enter into the kingdome of God. 
\v 23 And when they had ordeined them Elders by election in euery Church, and prayed, and fasted, they commended them to the Lord in whome they beleeued. 
\v 24 Thus they went throughout Pisidia, and came to Pamphylia. 
\v 25 And when they had preached the woorde in Perga, they came downe to Attalia, 
\v 26 And thence sailed to Antiochia, from whence they had bene comended vnto the grace of God, to the woorke, which they had fulfilled. 
\v 27 And when they were come and had gathered the Church together, they rehearsed all the things that God had done by them, and howe he had opened the doore of faith vnto the Gentiles. 
\v 28 So there they abode a long time with the disciples. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1 Then came downe certaine from Iudea, and taught the brethren, saying, Except ye be circumcised after the maner of Moses, ye cannot be saued. 
\v 2 And when there was great dissension, and disputation by Paul and Barnabas against them, they ordeyned that Paul and Barnabas, and certaine other of them, should goe vp to Hierusalem vnto the Apostles and Elders about this question. 
\v 3 Thus being brought forth by ye Church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conuersion of the Gentiles, and they brought great ioy vnto all the brethren. 
\v 4 And when they were come to Hierusalem, they were receiued of the Church, and of the Apostles and Elders, and they declared what things God had done by them. 
\v 5 But said they, certaine of the sect of the Pharises, which did beleeue, rose vp, saying, that it was needefull to circumcise them, and to commaund them to keepe the lawe of Moses. 
\v 6 Then the Apostles and Elders came together to looke to this matter. 
\v 7 And when there had bene great disputation, Peter rose vp, and said vnto them, Ye men and brethren, ye know that a good while ago, among vs God chose out me, that the Gentiles by my mouth should heare the worde of the Gospel, and beleeue. 
\v 8 And God which knoweth the heartes, bare them witnesse, in giuing vnto them ye holy Ghost euen as he did vnto vs. 
\v 9 And he put no difference betweene vs and them, after that by faith he had purified their heartes. 
\v 10 Nowe therefore, why tempt ye God, to lay a yoke on the disciples neckes, which neither our fathers, nor we were able to beare? 
\v 11 But we beleeue, through the grace of the Lord Iesus Christ to be saued, euen as they doe. 
\v 12 Then all the multitude kept silence, and heard Barnabas and Paul, which told what signes and wonders God had done among the Gentiles by them. 
\v 13 And when they helde their peace, Iames answered, saying, Men and brethren, hearken vnto me. 
\v 14 Simeon hath declared, howe God first did visite the Gentiles, to take of them a people vnto his Name. 
\v 15 And to this agree the woordes of the Prophets, as it is written, 
\v 16 After this I will returne, and will builde againe the tabernacle of Dauid, which is fallen downe, and the ruines thereof will I build againe, and I will set it vp, 
\v 17 That the residue of men might seeke after the Lord, and all the Gentiles vpon whom my Name is called, saith the Lord which doeth all these things. 
\v 18 From the beginning of the worlde, God knoweth all his workes. 
\v 19 Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them of the Gentiles that are turned to God, 
\v 20 But that we send vnto them, that they abstaine themselues from filthinesse of idoles, and fornication, and that that is strangled, and from blood. 
\v 21 For Moses of olde time hath in euery citie them that preache him, seeing he is read in the Synagogues euery Sabbath day. 
\v 22 Then it seemed good to the Apostles and Elders with the whole Church, to sende chosen men of their owne companie to Antiochia with Paul and Barnabas: to wit, Iudas whose surname was Barsabas and Silas, which were chiefe men among the brethren, 
\v 23 And wrote letters by them after this maner, THE APOSTLES, and the Elders, and the brethren, vnto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antiochia, and in Syria, and in Cilicia, send greeting. 
\v 24 Forasmuch as we haue heard, that certaine which went out from vs, haue troubled you with wordes, and cumbred your mindes, saying, Ye must be circumcised and keepe the Lawe: to whom we gaue no such commandement, 
\v 25 It seemed therefore good to vs, when we were come together with one accord, to send chosen men vnto you, with our beloued Barnabas and Paul, 
\v 26 Men that haue giuen vp their liues for the Name of our Lord Iesus Christ. 
\v 27 We haue therefore sent Iudas and Silas, which shall also tell you ye same things by mouth. 
\v 28 For it seemed good to the holy Ghost, and to vs, to lay no more burden vpon you, then these necessary things, 
\v 29 That is, that ye abstaine from things offered to idoles, and blood, and that that is strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keepe your selues, ye shall doe well. Fare ye well. 
\v 30 Nowe when they were departed, they came to Antiochia, and after that they had assembled the multitude, they deliuered the Epistle. 
\v 31 And when they had read it, they reioyced for the consolation. 
\v 32 And Iudas and Silas being Prophets, exhorted the brethren with many wordes, and strengthened them. 
\v 33 And after they had taried there a space, they were let goe in peace of the brethren vnto the Apostles. 
\v 34 Notwithstanding Silas thought good to abide there still. 
\v 35 Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antiochia, teaching and preaching with many other, the worde of the Lord. 
\v 36 But after certaine dayes, Paul said vnto Barnabas, Let vs returne, and visite our brethren in euery citie, where we haue preached the worde of the Lord, and see how they doe. 
\v 37 And Barnabas counselled to take with them Iohn, called Marke. 
\v 38 But Paul thought it not meete to take him vnto their companie, which departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the worke. 
\v 39 Then were they so stirred, that they departed asunder one from the other, so that Barnabas tooke Marke, and sailed vnto Cyprus. 
\v 40 And Paul chose Silas and departed, being commended of the brethren vnto the grace of God. 
\v 41 And he went through Syria and Cilicia, stablishing the Churches. 
\c 16  
\p
\v 1 Then came he to Derbe and to Lystra: and beholde, a certaine disciple was there named Timotheus, a womans sonne, which was a Iewesse and beleeued, but his father was a Grecian, 
\v 2 Of whom the brethren which were at Lystra and Iconium, reported well. 
\v 3 Therefore Paul would that he should go forth with him, and tooke and circumcised him, because of ye Iewes, which were in those quarters: for they knewe all, that his father was a Grecian. 
\v 4 And as they went through the cities, they deliuered them the decrees to keepe, ordeined of the Apostles and Elders, which were at Hierusalem. 
\v 5 And so were the Churches stablished in the faith, and encreased in number daily. 
\v 6 Nowe when they had gone throughout Phrygia, and the region of Galatia, they were forbidden of the holy Ghost to preache the worde in Asia. 
\v 7 Then came they to Mysia, and sought to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not. 
\v 8 Therefore they passed through Mysia, and came downe to Troas, 
\v 9 Where a vision appeared to Paul in the night. There stoode a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come into Macedonia, and helpe vs. 
\v 10 And after he had seene the vision, immediatly we prepared to goe into Macedonia, being assured that the Lord had called vs to preache the Gospel vnto them. 
\v 11 Then went we forth from Troas, and with a straight course came to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis, 
\v 12 And from thence to Philippi, which is the chiefe citie in ye partes of Macedonia, and whose inhabitants came from Rome to dwell there, and we were in that citie abiding certaine dayes. 
\v 13 And on the Sabbath day, we went out of the citie, besides a Riuer, where they were wont to pray: and we sate downe, and spake vnto the women, which were come together. 
\v 14 And a certaine woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the citie of the Thyatirians, which worshipped God, heard vs: whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended vnto the things, which Paul spake. 
\v 15 And when she was baptized, and her houshold, she besought vs, saying, If ye haue iudged me to be faithfull to ye Lord, come into mine house, and abide there: and she constrained vs. 
\v 16 And it came to passe that as we went to prayer, a certaine maide hauing a spirit of diuination, mette vs, which gate her masters much vantage with diuining. 
\v 17 She followed Paul and vs, and cryed, saying, These men are the seruants of the most high God, which shewe vnto you the way of saluation. 
\v 18 And this did she many dayes: but Paul being grieued, turned about, and said to the spirit, I commaund thee in the Name of Iesus Christ, that thou come out of her. And he came out the same houre. 
\v 19 Nowe when her masters sawe that the hope of their gaine was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drewe them into the market place vnto the Magistrates, 
\v 20 And brought them to the gouernours, saying, These men which are Iewes, trouble our citie, 
\v 21 And preache ordinances, which are not lawfull for vs to receiue, neither to obserue, seeing we are Romanes. 
\v 22 The people also rose vp together against them, and the gouernours rent their clothes, and commanded them to be beaten with roddes. 
\v 23 And when they had beaten them sore, they cast them into prison, commaunding the Iayler to keepe them surely. 
\v 24 Who hauing receiued such commandement, cast them into the inner prison, and made their feete fast in the stockes. 
\v 25 Nowe at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sung Psalmes vnto God: and the prisoners heard them. 
\v 26 And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundation of the prison was shaken: and by and by all the doores opened, and euery mans bands were loosed. 
\v 27 Then the keeper of the prison waked out of his sleepe, and when he sawe the prison doores open, he drewe out his sword and would haue killed himselfe, supposing the prisoners had bin fled. 
\v 28 But Paul cryed with a loude voyce, saying, Doe thy selfe no harme: for we are all here. 
\v 29 Then he called for a light, and leaped in, and came trembling, and fell downe before Paul and Silas, 
\v 30 And brought them out, and said, Syrs, what must I doe to be saued? 
\v 31 And they saide, Beleeue in the Lord Iesus Christ, and thou shalt be saued, and thine houshold. 
\v 32 And they preached vnto him the worde of the Lord, and to all that were in the house. 
\v 33 Afterwarde he tooke them the same houre of the night, and washed their stripes, and was baptized with all that belonged vnto him, straigthway. 
\v 34 And when he had brought them into his house, he set meate before them, and reioyced that he with all his houshold beleeued in God. 
\v 35 And when it was day, the gouernours sent the sergeants, saying, Let those men goe. 
\v 36 Then the keeper of the prison tolde these woordes vnto Paul, saying, The gouerness haue sent to loose you: nowe therefore get you hence, and goe in peace. 
\v 37 Then sayde Paul vnto them, After that they haue beaten vs openly vncodemned, which are Romanes, they haue cast vs into prison, and nowe would they put vs out priuily? nay verely: but let them come and bring vs out. 
\v 38 And the sergeants tolde these woordes vnto the gouernours, who feared whe they heard that they were Romanes. 
\v 39 Then came they and praied them, and brought them out, and desired them to depart out of the citie. 
\v 40 And they went out of the prison, and entred into the house of Lydia: and when they had seene the brethren, they comforted them, and departed. 
\c 17  
\p
\v 1 Nowe as they passed through Amphipolis, and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a Synagogue of the Iewes. 
\v 2 And Paul, as his maner was, went in vnto them, and three Sabbath daies disputed with them by the Scriptures, 
\v 3 Opening, and alleadging that Christ must haue suffered, and risen againe from the dead: and this is Iesus Christ, whom, said he, I preach to you. 
\v 4 And some of them beleeued, and ioyned in companie with Paul and Silas: also of the Grecians that feared God a great multitude, and of the chiefe women not a fewe. 
\v 5 But the Iewes which beleeued not, mooued with enuie, tooke vnto them certaine vagabonds and wicked fellowes, and whe they had assembled the multitude, they made a tumult in the citie, and made assault against the house of Iason, and sought to bring them out to the people. 
\v 6 But when they found them not, they drew Iason and certaine brethren vnto the heads of the citie, crying, These are they which haue subuerted the state of the world, and here they are, 
\v 7 Whom Iason hath receiued, and these all doe against the decrees of Cesar, saying that there is another King, one Iesus. 
\v 8 Then they troubled the people, and the heads of the citie, when they heard these things. 
\v 9 Notwithstanding when they had receiued sufficient assurance of Iason and of the other, they let them goe. 
\v 10 And the brethren immediatly sent away Paul and Silas by night vnto Berea, which when they were come thither, entred into ye Synagogue of the Iewes. 
\v 11 These were also more noble men then they which were at Thessalonica, which receiued the woorde with all readinesse, and searched the Scriptures daily, whether those things were so. 
\v 12 Therefore many of them beleeued, and of honest women, which were Grecians, and men not a fewe. 
\v 13 But when the Iewes of Thessalonica knewe, that the woord of God was also preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and mooued the people. 
\v 14 But by and by the brethren sent away Paul to goe as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still. 
\v 15 And they that did conduct Paul, brought him vnto Athens: and when they had receiued a commandement vnto Silas and Timotheus that they shoulde come to him at once, they departed. 
\v 16 Nowe while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirite was stirred in him, when hee sawe the citie subiect to idolatrie. 
\v 17 Therefore he disputed in the Synagogue with the Iewes, and with them that were religious, and in the market daily with whomesoeuer he met. 
\v 18 Then certaine Philosophers of the Epicures, and of the Stoickes, disputed with him, and some sayde, What will this babler say? Others sayde, He seemeth to be a setter forth of straunge gods (because hee preached vnto them Iesus, and the resurrection.) 
\v 19 And they tooke him, and brought him into Mars streete, saying, May we not know, what this newe doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is? 
\v 20 For thou bringest certaine strange thinges vnto our eares: we woulde knowe therefore, what these things meane. 
\v 21 For all the Athenians, and strangers which dwelt there, gaue them selues to nothing els, but either to tell, or to heare some newes. 
\v 22 Then Paul stoode in the mids of Mars streete, and sayde, Yee men of Athens, I perceiue that in all things yee are too superstitious. 
\v 23 For as I passed by, and behelde your deuotions, I founde an altar wherein was written, VNTO THE VNKNOWEN GOD. Whom ye then ignorantly worship, him shewe I vnto you. 
\v 24 God that made the world, and all things that are therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaue and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands, 
\v 25 Neither is worshipped with mens handes, as though he needed any thing, seeing hee giueth to all life and breath and all things, 
\v 26 And hath made of one blood all mankinde, to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath assigned the seasons which were ordeined before, and the boundes of their habitation, 
\v 27 That they shoulde seeke the Lord, if so be they might haue groped after him, and founde him though doubtlesse he be not farre from euery one of vs. 
\v 28 For in him we liue, and mooue, and haue our being, as also certaine of your owne Poets haue sayd, for we are also his generation. 
\v 29 Forasmuch then, as we are the generation of God, we ought not to thinke that ye Godhead is like vnto gold, or siluer, or stone grauen by arte and the inuention of man. 
\v 30 And the time of this ignorance God regarded not: but nowe hee admonisheth all men euery where to repent, 
\v 31 Because hee hath appoynted a day in the which he wil iudge the world in righteousnes, by that man whome hee hath appoynted, whereof he hath giuen an assurance to all men, in that hee hath raised him from the dead. 
\v 32 Now when they heard of the resurrection from the dead, some mocked, and other sayde, We will heare thee againe of this thing. 
\v 33 And so Paul departed from among them. 
\v 34 Howbeit certaine men claue vnto Paul, and beleeued: among whome was also Denys Areopagita, and a woman named Damaris, and other with them. 
\c 18  
\p
\v 1 After these thinges, Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinthus, 
\v 2 And found a certaine Iewe named Aquila, borne in Pontus, lately come from Italie, and his wife Priscilla (because that Claudius had commanded all Iewes to depart from Rome) and he came vnto them. 
\v 3 And because hee was of the same crafte, he abode with them and wrought (for their crafte was to make tentes.) 
\v 4 And he disputed in the Synagogue euery Sabbath day, and exhorted the Iewes, and the Grecians. 
\v 5 Now when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul, forced in spirit, testified to the Iewes that Iesus was the Christ. 
\v 6 And when they resisted and blasphemed, he shooke his raiment, and saide vnto them, Your blood be vpon your owne head: I am cleane: from henceforth will I goe vnto the Gentiles. 
\v 7 So he departed thence, and entred into a certaine mans house, named Iustus, a worshipper of God, whose house ioyned hard to the Synagogue. 
\v 8 And Crispus the chiefe ruler of the Synagogue, beleeued in the Lord with all his housholde: and many of the Corinthians hearing it, beleeued and were baptized. 
\v 9 Then saide the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Feare not, but speake, and holde not thy peace. 
\v 10 For I am with thee, and no man shall lay handes on thee to hurt thee: for I haue much people in this citie. 
\v 11 So he continued there a yeere and six moneths, and taught ye worde of God among them. 
\v 12 Now when Gallio was Deputie of Achaia, the Iewes arose with one accorde against Paul, and brought him to the iudgement seate, 
\v 13 Saying, This fellow persuadeth me to worship God otherwise then the Lawe appointeth. 
\v 14 And as Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio saide vnto the Iewes, If it were a matter of wrong, or an euill deede, O ye Iewes, I would according to reason maintaine you. 
\v 15 But if it bee a question of woordes, and names, and of your Lawe, looke yee to it your selues: for I will be no iudge of those things. 
\v 16 And hee draue them from the iudgement seate. 
\v 17 Then tooke al the Grecians Sosthenes the chiefe ruler of the Synagogue, and beat him before the iudgement seat: but Gallio cared nothing for those things. 
\v 18 But when Paul had taried there yet a good while, hee tooke leaue of the brethren, and sailed into Syria (and with him Priscilla and Aquila) after that he had shorne his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vowe. 
\v 19 Then hee came to Ephesus, and left them there: but hee entred into the Synagogue and disputed with the Iewes. 
\v 20 Who desired him to tarie a longer time with them: but he would not consent, 
\v 21 But bade the farewel, saying, I must needes keepe this feast that commeth, in Hierusalem: but I will returne againe vnto you, if God will. So he sailed from Ephesus. 
\v 22 And when hee came downe to Cesarea, he went vp to Hierusalem: and when he had saluted the Church, he went downe vnto Antiochia. 
\v 23 Nowe when he had taried there a while, he departed, and went thorowe the countrey of Galatia and Phrygia by order, strengthening all the disciples. 
\v 24 And a certaine Iewe named Apollos, borne at Alexandria, came to Ephesus, an eloquent man, and mightie in the Scriptures. 
\v 25 The same was instructed in the way of the Lord, and hee spake feruently in the Spirite, and taught diligently the things of the Lord, and knew but the baptisme of Iohn onely. 
\v 26 And he began to speake boldely in the Synagogue. Whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they tooke him vnto them, and expounded vnto him the way of God more perfectly. 
\v 27 And when hee was minded to goe into Achaia, the brethren exhorting him, wrote to the disciples to receiue him: and after hee was come thither, he holpe them much which had beleeued through grace. 
\v 28 For mightily hee confuted publikely the Iewes, with great vehemencie, shewing by the Scriptures, that Iesus was that Christ. 
\c 19  
\p
\v 1 And it came to passe, while Apollos was at Corinthus, that Paul when he passed thorow the vpper coasts, came to Ephesus, and found certaine disciples, 
\v 2 And saide vnto them, Haue ye receiued the holy Ghost since ye beleeued? And they saide vnto him, Wee haue not so much as heard whether there be an holy Ghost. 
\v 3 And he said vnto them, Vnto what were ye then baptized? And they saide, Vnto Iohns baptisme. 
\v 4 Then saide Paul, Iohn verely baptized with the baptisme of repentance, saying vnto the people, that they shoulde beleeue in him, which should come after him, that is, in Christ Iesus. 
\v 5 And when they heard it, they were baptized in the Name of the Lord Iesus. 
\v 6 So Paul layde his handes vpon them, and the holy Ghost came on them, and they spake the tongues, and prophecied. 
\v 7 And all the men were about twelue. 
\v 8 Moreouer he went into the Synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three moneths, disputing and exhorting to the things that appertaine to the kingdome of God. 
\v 9 But when certaine were hardened, and disobeyed, speaking euill of the way of God before the multitude, hee departed from them, and separated the disciples, and disputed dayly in the schoole of one Tyrannus. 
\v 10 And this was done by the space of two yeeres, so that all they which dwelt in Asia, heard the word of ye Lord Iesus, both Iewes and Grecians. 
\v 11 And God wrought no small miracles by the handes of Paul, 
\v 12 So that from his body were brought vnto the sicke, kerchefs or handkerchefs, and the diseases departed from them, and the euill spirits went out of them. 
\v 13 Then certaine of the vagabond Iewes, exorcistes, tooke in hand to name ouer them which had euil spirits, the Name of the Lord Iesus, saying, We adiure you by Iesus, whom Paul preacheth. 
\v 14 (And there were certaine sonnes of Sceua a Iewe, the Priest, about seuen which did this) 
\v 15 And the euil spirit answered, and said, Iesus I acknowledge, and Paul I know: but who are ye? 
\v 16 And the man in whome the euil spirit was, ranne on them, and ouercame them, and preuailed against them, so that they fledde out of that house, naked, and wounded. 
\v 17 And this was knowen to all the Iewes and Grecians also, which dwelt at Ephesus, and feare came on them all, and the Name of the Lord Iesus was magnified, 
\v 18 And many that beleeued, came and confessed, and shewed their workes. 
\v 19 Many also of them which vsed curious artes, brought their bookes, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fiftie thousand pieces of siluer. 
\v 20 So the worde of God grewe mightily, and preuailed. 
\v 21 Nowe when these things were accomplished, Paul purposed by the Spirite to passe through Macedonia and Achaia, and to goe to Hierusalem, saying, After I haue bene there, I must also see Rome. 
\v 22 So sent hee into Macedonia two of them that ministred vnto him, Timotheus and Erastus, but he remained in Asia for a season. 
\v 23 And the same time there arose no small trouble about that way. 
\v 24 For a certaine man named Demetrius a siluersmith, which made siluer temples of Diana, brought great gaines vnto the craftesmen, 
\v 25 Whom he called together, with the workemen of like things, and saide, Syrs, ye knowe that by this craft we haue our goods: 
\v 26 Moreouer ye see and heare, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia this Paul hath perswaded, and turned away much people, saying, That they be not gods which are made with handes. 
\v 27 So that not onely this thing is dangerous vnto vs, that this our portion shall be reproued, but also that the temple of the great goddesse Diana should be nothing esteemed, and that it would come to passe that her magnificence, which all Asia and the world worshippeth, should be destroyed. 
\v 28 Now when they heard it, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians. 
\v 29 And the whole citie was full of confusion, and they rushed into the common place with one assent, and caught Gaius, and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, and Pauls companions of his iourney. 
\v 30 And when Paul would haue entred in vnto the people, the disciples suffred him not. 
\v 31 Certaine also of the chiefe of Asia which were his friendes, sent vnto him, desiring him that hee woulde not present him selfe in the Common place. 
\v 32 Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assemblie was out of order, and the more part knewe not wherefore they were come together. 
\v 33 And some of the company drew foorth Alexander, the Iewes thrusting him forwards. Alexander then beckened with the hande, and woulde haue excused the matter to the people. 
\v 34 But when they knew that he was a Iewe, there arose a shoute almost for the space of two houres, of all men crying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians. 
\v 35 Then the towne clearke when hee had stayed the people, saide, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is it that knoweth not howe that the citie of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddesse Diana, and of the image, which came downe from Iupiter? 
\v 36 Seeing then that no man can speake against these things, ye ought to be appeased, and to doe nothing rashly. 
\v 37 For yee haue brought hither these men, which haue neither committed sacrilege, neither doe blaspheme your goddesse. 
\v 38 Wherefore, if Demetrius and the craftes men which are with him, haue a matter against any man, the lawe is open, and there are Deputies: let them accuse one another. 
\v 39 But if ye inquire any thing cocerning other matters, it may be determined in a lawful assembly. 
\v 40 For we are euen in ieopardie to be accused of this dayes sedition, for as much as there is no cause, whereby we may giue a reason of this concourse of people. 
\v 41 And when he had thus spoken, hee let the assembly depart. 
\c 20  
\p
\v 1 Nowe after the tumult was appeased, Paul called the disciples vnto him, and embraced them, and departed to goe into Macedonia. 
\v 2 And when hee had gone through those parts, and had exhorted them with many words, he came into Grecia. 
\v 3 And hauing taried there three moneths, because the Iewes layde waite for him, as hee was about to saile into Syria, hee purposed to returne through Macedonia. 
\v 4 And there accompanied him into Asia, Sopater of Berea, and of them of Thessalonica, Aristarchus, and Secundus, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus, and of them of Asia, Tychicus, and Trophimus. 
\v 5 These went before, and taried vs at Troas. 
\v 6 And we sailed forth from Philippi, after the dayes of vnleauened bread, and came vnto them to Troas in fiue dayes, where we abode seuen dayes. 
\v 7 And the first day of the weeke, the disciples being come together to breake bread, Paul preached vnto them, ready to depart on the morrow, and continued the preaching vnto midnight. 
\v 8 And there were many lightes in an vpper chamber, where they were gathered together. 
\v 9 And there sate in a windowe a certaine yong man, named Eutychus, fallen into a dead sleepe: and as Paul was long preaching, hee ouercome with sleepe, fell downe from the thirde loft, and was taken vp dead. 
\v 10 But Paul went downe, and layde himselfe vpon him, and embraced him, saying, Trouble not your selues: for his life is in him. 
\v 11 Then when Paul was come vp againe, and had broken bread, and eaten, hauing spoken a long while till the dawning of the day, hee so departed. 
\v 12 And they brought the boye aliue, and they were not a litle comforted. 
\v 13 Then we went before to shippe, and sailed vnto the citie Assos, that wee might receiue Paul there: for so had hee appointed, and would himselfe goe afoote. 
\v 14 Now when he was come vnto vs to Assos, and we had receiued him, we came to Mitylenes. 
\v 15 And wee sailed thence, and came the next day ouer against Chios, and the next day we arriued at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium: the next day we came to Miletum. 
\v 16 For Paul had determined to saile by Ephesus, because hee woulde not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted to be, if hee could possible, at Hierusalem, at the day of Pentecost. 
\v 17 Wherefore from Miletum, hee sent to Ephesus, and called the Elders of the Church. 
\v 18 Who when they were come to him, hee said vnto them, Ye know from the first day that I came into Asia, after what maner I haue bene with you at all seasons, 
\v 19 Seruing the Lord with all modestie, and with many teares, and tentations, which came vnto me by the layings awaite of the Iewes, 
\v 20 And how I kept backe nothing that was profitable, but haue shewed you, and taught you openly and throughout euery house, 
\v 21 Witnessing both to the Iewes, and to the Grecians the repentance towarde God, and faith toward our Lord Iesus Christ. 
\v 22 And nowe beholde, I goe bound in the Spirit vnto Hierusalem, and know not what things shall come vnto me there, 
\v 23 Saue that ye holy Ghost witnesseth in euery citie, saying, that bondes and afflictions abide me. 
\v 24 But I passe not at all, neither is my life deare vnto my selfe, so that I may fulfill my course with ioye, and the ministration which I haue receiued of the Lord Iesus, to testifie the Gospell of the grace of God. 
\v 25 And now behold, I know that henceforth ye all, through whome I haue gone preaching the kingdome of God, shall see my face no more. 
\v 26 Wherefore I take you to recorde this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men. 
\v 27 For I haue kept nothing backe, but haue shewed you all the counsell of God. 
\v 28 Take heede therefore vnto your selues, and to all the flocke, whereof the holy Ghost hath made you Ouerseers, to feede the Church of God, which hee hath purchased with that his owne blood. 
\v 29 For I knowe this, that after my departing shall grieuous wolues enter in among you, not sparing the flocke. 
\v 30 Moreouer of your owne selues shall men arise speaking peruerse thinges, to drawe disciples after them. 
\v 31 Therefore watche, and remember, that by the space of three yeres I ceased not to warne euery one, both night and day with teares. 
\v 32 And nowe brethren, I commend you to God, and to the worde of his grace, which is able to build further, and to giue you an inheritance, among all them, which are sanctified. 
\v 33 I haue coueted no mans siluer, nor gold, nor apparell. 
\v 34 Yea, ye knowe, that these handes haue ministred vnto my necessities, and to them that were with me. 
\v 35 I haue shewed you all things, howe that so labouring, ye ought to support the weake, and to remember the wordes of the Lord Iesus, howe that hee saide, It is a blessed thing to giue, rather then to receiue. 
\v 36 And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled downe, and prayed with them all. 
\v 37 Then they wept all abundantly, and fell on Pauls necke, and kissed him, 
\v 38 Being chiefly sorie for the words which he spake, That they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him vnto the shippe. 
\c 21  
\p
\v 1 And as we launched forth, and were departed from them, we came with a straight course vnto Coos, and the day following vnto the Rhodes, and from thence vnto Patara. 
\v 2 And we found a ship that went ouer vnto Phenice, and went aboard, and set forth. 
\v 3 And whe we had discouered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and sailed toward Syria, and arriued at Tyrus: for there the ship vnladed ye burden. 
\v 4 And when we had found disciples, we taried there seuen dayes. And they told Paul through the Spirit, that he should not goe vp to Hierusalem. 
\v 5 But when the dayes were ended, we departed and went our way, and they all accompanied vs with their wiues and children, euen out of the citie: and we kneeling downe on the shore, prayed. 
\v 6 Then when we had embraced one another, we tooke ship, and they returned home. 
\v 7 And when we had ended the course from Tyrus, we arriued at Ptolemais, and saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day. 
\v 8 And the next day, Paul and we that were with him, departed, and came vnto Cesarea: and we entred into the house of Philippe the Euangelist, which was one of the seuen Deacons, and abode with him. 
\v 9 Now he had foure daughters virgins, which did prophecie. 
\v 10 And as we taried there many dayes, there came a certaine Prophet from Iudea, named Agabus. 
\v 11 And when he was come vnto vs, he tooke Pauls girdle, and bound his owne hands and feete, and sayd, Thus sayth the holy Ghost, So shall the Iewes at Hierusalem binde the man that oweth this girdle, and shall deliuer him into the hands of the Gentiles. 
\v 12 And when we had heard these things, both we and other of the same place besought him that he would not go vp to Hierusalem. 
\v 13 Then Paul answered, and sayd, What doe ye weeping and breaking mine heart? For I am ready not to be bound onely, but also to die at Hierusalem for the Name of the Lord Iesus. 
\v 14 So when he would not be perswaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done. 
\v 15 And after those dayes we trussed vp our fardels, and went vp to Hierusalem. 
\v 16 There went with vs also certaine of the disciples of Cesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an olde disciple, with whome we should lodge. 
\v 17 And when we were come to Hierusalem, the brethren receiued vs gladly. 
\v 18 And the next day Paul went in with vs vnto Iames: and all the Elders were there assembled. 
\v 19 And when he had embraced them, hee tolde by order all things, that God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministration. 
\v 20 So when they heard it, they glorified God, and sayd vnto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousand Iewes there are which beleeue, and they are all zealous of the Law: 
\v 21 Now they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Iewes, which are among the Gentiles, to forsake Moses, and sayest that they ought not to circumcise their sonnes, neither to liue after the customes. 
\v 22 What is then to be done? the multitude must needes come together: for they shall heare that thou art come. 
\v 23 Doe therefore this that we say to thee. We haue foure men, which haue made a vowe, 
\v 24 Them take, and purifie thy selfe with them, and contribute with them, that they may shaue their heads: and all shall knowe, that those things, whereof they haue bene informed concerning thee, are nothing, but that thou thy selfe also walkest and keepest the Lawe. 
\v 25 For as touching ye Gentiles, which beleeue, we haue written, and determined that they obserue no such thing, but that they keepe themselues from things offred to idoles, and from blood, and from that that is strangled, and from fornication. 
\v 26 Then Paul tooke the men, and the next day was purified with them, and entred into the Temple, declaring the accomplishment of the dayes of the purification, vntill that an offering should be offered for euery one of them. 
\v 27 And when the seuen dayes were almost ended, the Iewes which were of Asia (when they sawe him in the Temple) moued all the people, and laide hands on him, 
\v 28 Crying, Men of Israel, helpe: this is the man that teacheth all men euery where against the people, and the Lawe, and this place: moreouer, he hath brought Grecians into the Temple, and hath polluted this holy place. 
\v 29 For they had seene before Trophimus an Ephesian with him in the citie, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the Temple. 
\v 30 Then all the citie was moued, and the people ran together: and they tooke Paul and drewe him out of the Temple, and forth with the doores were shut. 
\v 31 But as they went about to kill him, tydings came vnto the chiefe captaine of the band, that all Hierusalem was on an vproare. 
\v 32 Who immediately tooke souldiers and Centurions, and ran downe vnto them: and when they sawe the chiefe Captaine and the souldiers, they left beating of Paul. 
\v 33 Then the chiefe Captaine came neere and tooke him, and commanded him to be bound with two chaines, and demaunded who he was, and what he had done. 
\v 34 And one cryed this, another that, among the people. So when he could not know the certeintie for the tumult, he commanded him to be led into the castell. 
\v 35 And when hee came vnto the grieces, it was so that he was borne of the souldiers, for the violence of the people. 
\v 36 For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him. 
\v 37 And as Paul should haue bene led into the castell, he sayd vnto the chiefe Captaine, May I speake vnto thee? Who sayd, Canst thou speake Greeke? 
\v 38 Art not thou the Egyptian who before these dayes raised a sedition, and led out into the wildernesse foure thousande men that were murtherers? 
\v 39 Then Paul sayde, Doubtlesse, I am a man which am a Iewe, and citizen of Tarsus, a famous citie of Cilicia, and I beseech thee, suffer mee to speake vnto the people. 
\v 40 And when he had giuen him licence, Paul stoode on the grieces, and beckened with the hand vnto the people: and when there was made great silence, hee spake vnto them in the Hebrewe tongue, saying, 
\c 22  
\p
\v 1 Ye men, brethren and Fathers, heare my defence nowe towards you. 
\v 2 (And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrewe tongue to them, they kept the more silence, and he sayd) 
\v 3 I am verely a man, which am a Iew, borne in Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought vp in this citie at the feete of Gamaliel, and instructed according to the perfect maner of the Lawe of the Fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day. 
\v 4 And I persecuted this way vnto the death, binding and deliuering into prison both men and women. 
\v 5 As also ye chiefe Priest doeth beare me witnes, and al the company of the Elders: of whom also I receiued letters vnto the brethren, and went to Damascus to bring them which were there, bound vnto Hierusalem, that they might be punished. 
\v 6 And so it was, as I iourneyed and was come neere vnto Damascus about noone, that suddenly there shone from heauen a great light round about me. 
\v 7 So I fell vnto the earth, and heard a voyce, saying vnto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou mee? 
\v 8 Then I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said to me, I am Iesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest. 
\v 9 Moreouer they that were with me, sawe in deede a light and were afraide: but they heard not the voyce of him that spake vnto me. 
\v 10 Then I sayd, What shall I doe, Lord? And the Lord sayde vnto me, Arise, and goe into Damascus: and there it shall be tolde thee of all things, which are appointed for thee to doe. 
\v 11 So when I could not see for the glory of that light, I was led by the hand of them that were with me, and came into Damascus. 
\v 12 And one Ananias a godly man, as perteining to the Lawe, hauing good report of all the Iewes which dwelt there, 
\v 13 Came vnto me, and stoode, and sayd vnto me, Brother Saul, receiue thy sight: and that same houre I looked vpon him. 
\v 14 And he sayd, The God of our fathers hath appointed thee, that thou shouldest knowe his wil, and shouldest see that Iust one, and shouldest heare the voyce of his mouth. 
\v 15 For thou shalt be his witnes vnto all men, of the things which thou hast seene and heard. 
\v 16 Now therefore why tariest thou? Arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sinnes, in calling on the Name of the Lord. 
\v 17 And it came to passe, that when I was come againe to Hierusalem, and prayed in the Temple, I was in a traunce, 
\v 18 And saw him saying vnto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Hierusalem: for they will not receiue thy witnes concerning me. 
\v 19 Then I sayd, Lord, they know that I prisoned, and beat in euery Synagogue them that beleeued in thee. 
\v 20 And when the blood of thy martyr Steuen was shed, I also stood by, and consented vnto his death, and kept the clothes of them that slew him. 
\v 21 Then he sayd vnto me, Depart: for I will send thee farre hence vnto the Gentiles. 
\v 22 And they heard him vnto this worde, but then they lift vp their voyces, and sayd, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not meete that he should liue. 
\v 23 And as they cried and cast off their clothes, and threw dust into the aire, 
\v 24 The chiefe captaine commanded him to be led into the castle, and bade that he should be scourged, and examined, that he might knowe wherefore they cryed so on him. 
\v 25 And as they bound him with thongs, Paul sayd vnto the Centurion that stood by, Is it lawfull for you to scourge one that is a Romane, and not condemned? 
\v 26 Nowe when the Centurion heard it, hee went, and tolde the chiefe captaine, saying, Take heede what thou doest: for this man is a Romane. 
\v 27 Then the chiefe captaine came, and sayd to him, Tel me, art thou a Romane? And he said, Yea. 
\v 28 And the chiefe captaine answered, With a great summe obtained I this freedome. Then Paul sayd, But I was so borne. 
\v 29 Then straightway they departed from him, which should haue examined him: and the chiefe captaine also was afrayd, after he knewe that hee was a Romane, and that he had bound him. 
\v 30 On the next day, because hee would haue knowen the certaintie wherefore he was accused of the Iewes, he loosed him from his bonds, and commanded the hie Priests and all their Councill to come together: and he brought Paul, and set him before them. 
\c 23  
\p
\v 1 And Paul behelde earnestly the Councill, and sayde, Men and brethren, I haue in all good conscience serued God vntill this day. 
\v 2 Then the hie Priest Ananias commanded them that stood by, to smite him on the mouth. 
\v 3 Then sayd Paul to him, God will smite thee, thou whited wall: for thou sittest to iudge me according to the Lawe, and transgressing the Lawe, commaundest thou me to be smitten? 
\v 4 And they that stood by, sayd, Reuilest thou Gods hie Priest? 
\v 5 Then sayd Paul, I knewe not, brethren, that he was the hie Priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speake euill of the ruler of thy people. 
\v 6 But when Paul perceiued that the one part were of the Sadduces, and the other of the Pharises, hee cried in the Council, Men and brethren, I am a Pharise, the sonne of a Pharise: I am accused of the hope and resurrection of the dead. 
\v 7 And when hee had saide this, there was a dissension betweene the Pharises and the Sadduces, so that the multitude was deuided. 
\v 8 For the Sadduces say that there is no resurrection, neither Angel, nor spirit: but the Pharises confesse both. 
\v 9 Then there was a great crye: and the Scribes of the Pharises part rose vp, and stroue, saying, Wee finde none euill in this man: but if a spirit or an Angel hath spoken to him, let vs not fight against God. 
\v 10 And when there was a great dissension, the chiefe captaine, fearing lest Paul should haue bene pulled in pieces of them, commanded the souldiers to go downe, and take him from among them, and to bring him into the castel. 
\v 11 Nowe the night folowing, the Lord stoode by him, and saide, Be of good courage, Paul: for as thou hast testified of mee in Hierusalem, so must thou beare witnesse also at Rome. 
\v 12 And when the day was come, certaine of the Iewes made an assemblie, and bounde themselues with a curse, saying, that they woulde neither eate nor drinke, till they had killed Paul. 
\v 13 And they were more then fourtie, which had made this conspiracie. 
\v 14 And they came to the chiefe Priestes and Elders, and said, We haue bound our selues with a solemne curse, that wee will eate nothing, vntill we haue slaine Paul. 
\v 15 Nowe therefore, ye and the Council signifie to the chiefe captaine, that hee bring him foorth vnto you to morow: as though you would know some thing more perfectly of him, and we, or euer he come neere, will be readie to kill him. 
\v 16 But when Pauls sisters sonne heard of their laying awaite, he went, and entred into the castel, and tolde Paul. 
\v 17 And Paul called one of the Centurions vnto him, and said, Take this yong man hence vnto the chiefe captaine: for he hath a certaine thing to shewe him. 
\v 18 So hee tooke him, and brought him to the chiefe captaine, and saide, Paul the prisoner called mee vnto him, and prayed mee to bring this yong man vnto thee, which hath some thing to say vnto thee. 
\v 19 Then the chiefe captaine tooke him by the hande, and went apart with him alone, and asked him, What hast thou to shewe me? 
\v 20 And he saide, The Iewes haue conspired to desire thee, that thou wouldest bring foorth Paul to morow into the Council, as though they would inquire somewhat of him more perfectly: 
\v 21 But let them not perswade thee: for there lie in waite for him of them, more then fourtie men, which haue bound themselues with a curse, that they will neither eate nor drinke, till they haue killed him: and nowe are they readie, and waite for thy promise. 
\v 22 The chiefe captaine then let the yong man depart, after hee had charged him to vtter it to no man, that he had shewed him these things. 
\v 23 And he called vnto him two certaine Centurions, saying, Make readie two hundred souldiers, that they may go to Cæsarea, and horsemen three score and ten, and two hundred with dartes, at the thirde houre of the night. 
\v 24 And let them make readie an horse, that Paul being set on, may be brought safe vnto Felix the Gouernour. 
\v 25 And he wrote an epistle in this maner: 
\v 26 Claudius Lysias vnto the most noble Gouernour Felix sendeth greeting. 
\v 27 As this man was taken of the Iewes, and shoulde haue bene killed of them, I came vpon them with the garison, and rescued him, perceiuing that he was a Romane. 
\v 28 And when I would haue knowen the cause, wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their Council. 
\v 29 There I perceiued that hee was accused of questions of their Lawe, but had no crime worthy of death, or of bondes. 
\v 30 And when it was shewed me, how that the Iewes layd waite for the man, I sent him straightway to thee, and commanded his accusers to speake before thee the thinges that they had against him. Farewell. 
\v 31 Then the souldiers as it was commanded them, tooke Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris. 
\v 32 And the next day, they left the horsemen to goe with him, and returned vnto the Castel. 
\v 33 Now when they came to Cæsarea, they deliuered the epistle to the Gouernour, and presented Paul also vnto him. 
\v 34 So when the Gouernour had read it, hee asked of what prouince he was: and when he vnderstoode that he was of Cilicia, 
\v 35 I will heare thee, said he, when thine accusers also are come, and commanded him to bee kept in Herods iudgement hall. 
\c 24  
\p
\v 1 Now after fiue dayes, Ananias the hie Priest came downe with the Elders, and with Tertullus a certaine oratour, which appeared before the Gouernour against Paul. 
\v 2 And when he was called foorth, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that we haue obtained great quietnesse through thee, and that many worthy things are done vnto this nation through thy prouidence, 
\v 3 We acknowledge it wholy, and in all places most noble Felix, with all thankes, 
\v 4 But that I be not tedious vnto thee, I pray thee, that thou wouldest heare vs of thy courtesie a fewe wordes. 
\v 5 Certainely we haue found this man a pestilent fellowe, and a moouer of sedition among all the Iewes throughout the world, and a chiefe maintainer of the secte of the Nazarites: 
\v 6 And hath gone about to pollute the Temple: therefore wee tooke him, and woulde haue iudged him according to our Lawe: 
\v 7 But the chiefe captaine Lysias came vpon vs, and with great violence tooke him out of our handes, 
\v 8 Commanding his accusers to come to thee: of whom thou mayest (if thou wilt inquire) know all these things whereof we accuse him. 
\v 9 And the Iewes likewise affirmed, saying that it was so. 
\v 10 Then Paul, after that the gouernour had beckened vnto him that hee shoulde speake, answered, I do the more gladly answere for my selfe, for as much as I knowe that thou hast bene of many yeres a iudge vnto this nation, 
\v 11 Seeing that thou mayest knowe, that there are but twelue dayes since I came vp to worship in Hierusalem. 
\v 12 And they neither found mee in the Temple disputing with any man, neither making vproare among the people, neither in the Synagogues, nor in the citie. 
\v 13 Neither can they proue the things, whereof they now accuse me. 
\v 14 But this I confesse vnto thee, that after the way (which they call heresie) so worship I the God of my fathers, beleeuing all things which are written in the Lawe and the Prophets, 
\v 15 And haue hope towardes God, that the resurrection of the dead, which they themselues looke for also, shalbe both of iust and vniust. 
\v 16 And herein I endeuour my selfe to haue alway a cleare conscience towarde God, and toward men. 
\v 17 Now after many yeres, I came and brought almes to my nation and offerings. 
\v 18 At what time, certaine Iewes of Asia founde mee purified in the Temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult. 
\v 19 Who ought to haue bene present before thee, and accuse me, if they had ought against me. 
\v 20 Or let these themselues say, if they haue found any vniust thing in mee, while I stoode in the Council, 
\v 21 Except it be for this one voyce, that I cried standing among them, Of the resurrection of the dead am I accused of you this day. 
\v 22 Nowe when Felix heard these things, he deferred them, and said, When I shall more perfectly know the things which concerne this way, by the comming of Lysias the chiefe Captaine, I will decise your matter. 
\v 23 Then hee commanded a Centurion to keepe Paul, and that he should haue ease, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister vnto him, or to come vnto him. 
\v 24 And after certaine dayes, came Felix with his wife Drusilla, which was a Iewesse, and he called foorth Paul, and heard him of the faith in Christ. 
\v 25 And as he disputed of righteousnes and temperance, and of the iudgement to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time, and when I haue conuenient time, I will call for thee. 
\v 26 Hee hoped also that money shoulde haue bene giuen him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore hee sent for him the oftner, and communed with him. 
\v 27 When two yeeres were expired, Porcius Festus came into Felix roume: and Felix willing to get fauour of the Iewes, left Paul bound. 
\c 25  
\p
\v 1 When Festus was then come into the prouince, after three dayes he went vp from Caesarea vnto Hierusalem. 
\v 2 Then the high Priest, and the chiefe of the Iewes appeared before him against Paul: and they besought him, 
\v 3 And desired fauour against him, that hee would send for him to Hierusalem: and they layd waite to kill him by the way. 
\v 4 But Festus answered, that Paul should bee kept at Caesarea, and that he himselfe would shortly depart thither. 
\v 5 Let them therefore, saide he, which among you are able, come downe with vs: and if there be any wickednes in the man, let them accuse him. 
\v 6 Now when he had taried among them no more then ten dayes, hee went downe to Caesarea, and the next day sate in the iudgement seat, and commanded Paul to be brought. 
\v 7 And when hee was come, the Iewes which were come from Hierusalem, stoode about him and layd many and grieuous complaints against Paul, whereof they could make no plaine proofe, 
\v 8 Forasmuch as he answered, that he had neither offended any thing against the lawe of the Iewes, neither against ye temple, nor against Caesar. 
\v 9 Yet Festus willing to get fauour of the Iewes, answered Paul and saide, Wilt thou goe vp to Hierusalem, and there be iudged of these things before mee? 
\v 10 Then said Paul, I stand at Caesars iudgment seate, where I ought to be iudged: to the Iewes I haue done no wrong, as thou very well knowest. 
\v 11 For if I haue done wrong, or committed any thing worthie of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof they accuse me, no man, to pleasure them, can deliuer me to them: I appeale vnto Caesar. 
\v 12 Then when Festus had spoken with the Council, hee answered, Hast thou appealed vnto Caesar? vnto Caesar shalt thou goe. 
\v 13 And after certaine dayes, King Agrippa and Bernice came downe to Caesarea to salute Festus. 
\v 14 And when they had remained there many dayes, Festus declared Pauls cause vnto the King, saying, There is a certaine man left in prison by Felix, 
\v 15 Of whom when I came to Hierusalem, the high Priestes and Elders of the Iewes informed me, and desired to haue iudgement against him. 
\v 16 To whome I answered, that it is not the maner of the Romanes for fauour to deliuer any man to the death, before that hee which is accused, haue the accusers before him, and haue place to defend himselfe, concerning the crime. 
\v 17 Therefore when they were come hither, without delay the day following I sate on the iudgement seate, and commanded the man to be brought foorth. 
\v 18 Against whom when the accusers stood vp, they brought no crime of such things as I supposed: 
\v 19 But had certaine questions against him of their owne superstition, and of one Iesus which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be aliue. 
\v 20 And because I doubted of such maner of question, I asked him whether he would goe to Hierusalem, and there be iudged of these things. 
\v 21 But because he appealed to be reserued to the examination of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept, till I mght send him to Cesar. 
\v 22 Then Agrippa sayd vnto Festus, I would also heare the man my selfe. To morowe, sayd he, thou shalt heare him. 
\v 23 And on the morowe when Agrippa was come and Bernice with great pompe, and were entred into the Common hall with the chiefe captaines and chiefe men of the citie, at Festus commandement Paul was brought forth. 
\v 24 And Festus sayd, King Agrippa, and all men which are present with vs, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Iewes haue called vpon me, both at Hierusalem, and here, crying, that he ought not to liue any longer. 
\v 25 Yet haue I found nothing worthy of death, that he hath committed: neuertheles, seeing that he hath appealed to Augustus, I haue determined to send him. 
\v 26 Of whome I haue no certaine thing to write vnto my Lord: wherefore I haue brought him forth vnto you, and specially vnto thee, King Agrippa, that after examination had, I might haue somewhat to write. 
\v 27 For me thinketh it vnreasonable to send a prisoner, and not to shewe the causes which are layde against him. 
\c 26  
\p
\v 1 Then Agrippa sayd vnto Paul, Thou art permitted to speake for thy selfe. So Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himselfe. 
\v 2 I thinke my selfe happy, King Agrippa, because I shall answere this day before thee of all the things whereof I am accused of the Iewes. 
\v 3 Chiefly, because thou hast knowledge of all customes, and questions which are among the Iewes: wherefore I beseech thee, to heare me patiently. 
\v 4 As touching my life from my childhood, and what it was from the beginning among mine owne nation at Hierusalem, know all the Iewes, 
\v 5 Which knewe me heretofore, euen from my elders (if they would testifie) that after the most straite sect of our religion I liued a Pharise. 
\v 6 And now I stand and am accused for the hope of the promise made of God vnto our fathers. 
\v 7 Whereunto our twelue tribes instantly seruing God day and night, hope to come: for the which hopes sake, O King Agrippa, I am accused of the Iewes. 
\v 8 Why should it be thought a thing incredible vnto you, that God should raise againe the dead? 
\v 9 I also verely thought in my selfe, that I ought to doe many contrarie things against the Name of Iesus of Nazareth. 
\v 10 Which thing I also did in Hierusalem: for many of the Saints I shut vp in prison, hauing receiued authoritie of the hie Priests, and when they were put to death, I gaue my sentence. 
\v 11 And I punished them throughout all the Synagogues, and compelled them to blaspheme, and being more mad against them, I persecuted them, euen vnto strange cities. 
\v 12 At which time, euen as I went to Damascus with authoritie, and commission from the hie Priests, 
\v 13 At midday, O King, I sawe in the way a light from heauen, passing the brightnes of the sunne, shine round about mee, and them which went with me. 
\v 14 So when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voyce speaking vnto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? It is hard for thee to kicke against pricks. 
\v 15 Then I sayd, Who art thou, Lord? And he sayd, I am Iesus whom thou persecutest. 
\v 16 But rise and stand vp on thy feete: for I haue appeared vnto thee for this purpose, to appoint thee a minister and a witnesse, both of the things which thou hast seene, and of the things in the which I will appeare vnto thee, 
\v 17 Deliuering thee from this people, and from the Gentiles, vnto whom now I send thee, 
\v 18 To open their eyes, that they may turne from darknes to light, and from the power of Satan vnto God, that they may receiue forgiuenes of sinnes, and inheritance among them, which are sanctified by fayth in me. 
\v 19 Wherefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient vnto the heauenly vision, 
\v 20 But shewed first vnto them of Damascus, and at Hierusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Iudea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turne to God, and doe workes worthy amendment of life. 
\v 21 For this cause the Iewes caught me in the Temple, and went about to kill me. 
\v 22 Neuertheles, I obteined helpe of God, and continue vnto this day, witnessing both to small and to great, saying none other things, then those which the Prophets and Moses did say should come, 
\v 23 To wit, that Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light vnto this people, and to the Gentiles. 
\v 24 And as he thus answered for himselfe, Festus said with a loude voyce, Paul, thou art besides thy selfe: much learning doeth make thee mad. 
\v 25 But he said, I am not mad, O noble Festus, but I speake the wordes of trueth and sobernes. 
\v 26 For the King knoweth of these things, before whom also I speake boldly: for I am perswaded that none of these things are hidden from him: for this thing was not done in a corner. 
\v 27 O King Agrippa, beleeuest thou the Prophets? I know that thou beleeuest. 
\v 28 Then Agrippa said vnto Paul, Almost thou perswadest me to become a Christian. 
\v 29 Then Paul sayd, I would to God that not onely thou, but also all that heare me to day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds. 
\v 30 And when he had thus spoken, the King rose vp, and the gouernour, and Bernice, and they that sate with them. 
\v 31 And when they were gone apart, they talked betweene themselues, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death, nor of bonds. 
\v 32 Then sayd Agrippa vnto Festus, This man might haue bene loosed, if hee had not appealed vnto Cesar. 
\c 27  
\p
\v 1 Now when it was concluded, that we should sayle into Italie, they deliuered both Paul, and certaine other prisoners vnto a Centurion named Iulius, of the band of Augustus. 
\v 2 And we entred into a ship of Adramyttium purposing to saile by the coastes of Asia, and launched foorth, and had Aristarchus of Macedonia, a Thessalonian, with vs. 
\v 3 And the next day we arriued at Sidon: and Iulius courteously entreated Paul, and gaue him libertie to go vnto his friends, that they might refresh him. 
\v 4 And from thence we launched, and sayled hard by Cyprus, because ye windes were contrarie. 
\v 5 Then sayled we ouer the sea by Cilicia, and Pamphilia, and came to Myra, a citie in Lycia. 
\v 6 And there the Centurion found a ship of Alexandria, sayling into Italie, and put vs therein. 
\v 7 And when we had sayled slowly many dayes, and scarce were come against Gnidum, because the winde suffered vs not, we sailed hard by Candie, neere to Salmone, 
\v 8 And with much adoe sayled beyond it, and came vnto a certaine place called the Faire hauens, neere vnto the which was the citie Lasea. 
\v 9 So when much time was spent, and sayling was now ieopardous, because also the Fast was nowe passed, Paul exhorted them, 
\v 10 And sayde vnto them, Syrs, I see that this voiage will be with hurt and much damage, not of the lading and ship onely, but also of our liues. 
\v 11 Neuertheles the Centurion beleeued rather the gouernour and the master of the ship, then those things which were spoken of Paul. 
\v 12 And because the hauen was not commodious to winter in, many tooke counsell to depart thence, if by any meanes they might attaine to Phenice, there to winter, which is an hauen of Candie, and lyeth toward the Southwest and by West, and Northwest and by West. 
\v 13 And when the Southerne winde blew softly, they supposing to atteine their purpose, loosed neerer, and sailed by Candie. 
\v 14 But anon after, there arose by it a stormy winde called Euroclydon. 
\v 15 And when the ship was caught, and could not resist the winde, we let her goe, and were caried away. 
\v 16 And we ran vnder a litle Yle named Clauda, and had much a doe to get the boat. 
\v 17 Which they tooke vp and vsed all helpe, vndergirding the ship, fearing least they should haue fallen into Syrtes, and they strake saile, and so were caried. 
\v 18 The next day when we were tossed with an exceeding tempest, they lightened the ship. 
\v 19 And the third day we cast out with our owne hands the tackling of the ship. 
\v 20 And when neither sunne nor starres in many dayes appeared, and no small tempest lay vpon vs, all hope that we should be saued, was then taken away. 
\v 21 But after long abstinece, Paul stood forth in the mids of them, and said, Syrs, ye should haue hearkened to me, and not haue loosed from Candie: so should ye haue gained this hurt and losse. 
\v 22 But now I exhort you to be of good courage: for there shalbe no losse of any mans life among you, saue of the ship onely. 
\v 23 For there stood by me this night the Angel of God, whose I am, and whome I serue, 
\v 24 Saying, Feare not, Paul: for thou must be brought before Cesar: and lo, God hath giuen vnto thee freely all that sayle with thee. 
\v 25 Wherefore, sirs, be of good courage: for I beleeue God, that it shall be so as it hath bene tolde me. 
\v 26 Howbeit, we must be cast into a certaine Iland. 
\v 27 And when ye fourteenth night was come, as we were caried to and from in the Adriaticall sea about midnight, the shipmen deemed that some countrey approched vnto them, 
\v 28 And sounded, and found it twentie fathoms: and when they had gone a litle further, they sounded againe, and found fifteene fathoms. 
\v 29 Then fearing least they should haue fallen into some rough places, they cast foure ancres out of the sterne, and wished that the day were come. 
\v 30 Nowe as the mariners were about to flee out of the ship, and had let downe the boat into the sea vnder a colour as though they would haue cast ankers out of the foreship, 
\v 31 Paul sayde vnto the Centurion and the souldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye can not be safe. 
\v 32 Then the souldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let it fall away. 
\v 33 And when it began to be day, Paul exhorted them all to take meate, saying, This is the fourteenth day that ye haue taried, and continued fasting, receiuing nothing: 
\v 34 Wherefore I exhort you to take meate: for this is for your safegarde: for there shall not an heare fall from the head of any of you. 
\v 35 And when he had thus spoken, hee tooke bread and gaue thankes to God, in presence of them all, and brake it, and began to eate. 
\v 36 Then were they all of good courage, and they also tooke meate. 
\v 37 Nowe we were in the ship in all two hundreth three score and sixteene soules. 
\v 38 And whe they had eaten ynough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea. 
\v 39 And when it was day, they knewe not the countrey, but they spied a certaine creeke with a banke, into the which they were minded (if it were possible) to thrust in the ship. 
\v 40 So when they had taken vp the ankers, they committed the ship vnto the sea, and loosed the rudder bonds, and hoised vp the maine saile to the winde, and drewe to the shore. 
\v 41 And when they fell into a place, where two seas met, they thrust in the ship: and the forepart stucke fast, and could not be moued, but the hinderpart was broken with the violence of the waues. 
\v 42 Then the souldiers counsell was to kill the prisoners, least any of them, when he had swomme out, should flee away. 
\v 43 But the Centurion willing to saue Paul, stayed them from this counsell, and commanded that they that coulde swimme, shoulde cast them selues first into the sea, and goe out to land: 
\v 44 And the other, some on boardes, and some on certaine pieces of the ship: and so it came to passe that they came all safe to land. 
\c 28  
\p
\v 1 And when they were come safe, then they knewe that the Yle was called Melita. 
\v 2 And the Barbarians shewed vs no litle kindnesse: for they kindled a fire, and receiued vs euery one, because of the present showre, and because of the colde. 
\v 3 And when Paul had gathered a nomber of stickes, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heate, and leapt on his hand. 
\v 4 Nowe when ye Barbarians saw the worme hang on his hand, they said among themselues, This man surely is a murtherer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet Vengeance hath not suffered to liue. 
\v 5 But he shooke off the worme into the fire, and felt no harme. 
\v 6 Howbeit they wayted whe he should haue swolne, or fallen downe dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and sawe no inconuenience come to him, they changed their mindes, and said, That he was a God. 
\v 7 In the same quarters, the chiefe man of the Yle (whose name was Publius) had possessions: the same receiued vs, and lodged vs three dayes courteously. 
\v 8 And so it was, that the father of Publius lay sicke of the feauer, and of a bloodie flixe: to whom Paul entred in, and when he prayed, he laide his hands on him, and healed him. 
\v 9 When this then was done, other also in the Yle, which had diseases, came to him, and were healed, 
\v 10 Which also did vs great honour: and when we departed, they laded vs with things necessarie. 
\v 11 Nowe after three moneths we departed in a shippe of Alexandria, which had wintred in the Yle, whose badge was Castor and Pollux. 
\v 12 And when we arriued at Syracuse, we taried there three dayes. 
\v 13 And from thence we set a compasse, and came to Rhegium: and after one day, the South wind blewe, and we came the seconde day to Putioli: 
\v 14 Where we found brethren, and were desired to tary with them seuen dayes, and so we went toward Rome. 
\v 15 And from thence, when the brethren heard of vs, they came to meete vs at the Market of Appius, and at the Three tauernes, whom when Paul sawe, he thanked God, and waxed bolde. 
\v 16 So when we came to Rome, the Centurion deliuered the prisoners to the generall Captaine: but Paul was suffered to dwell by him selfe with a souldier that kept him. 
\v 17 And the third day after, Paul called the chiefe of the Iewes together: and when they were come, he said vnto them, Men and brethren, though I haue committed nothing against the people, or Lawes of the fathers, yet was I deliuered prisoner from Hierusalem into the handes of the Romanes. 
\v 18 Who when they had examined me, would haue let me goe, because there was no cause of death in me. 
\v 19 But when the Iewes spake contrary, I was constrained to appeale vnto Cesar, not because I had ought to accuse my nation of. 
\v 20 For this cause therefore haue I called for you, to see you, and to speake with you: for that hope of Israels sake, I am bound with this chaine. 
\v 21 Then they saide vnto him, We neither receiued letters out of Iudea concerning thee, neither came any of the brethren that shewed or spake any euill of thee. 
\v 22 But we will heare of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we knowe that euery where it is spoken against. 
\v 23 And when they had appointed him a day, there came many vnto him into his lodging, to whom he expounded testifying the kingdome of God, and persuading them those things that concerne Iesus, both out of the Lawe of Moses, and out of the Prophets, from morning to night. 
\v 24 And some were persuaded with ye things which were spoken, and some beleeued not. 
\v 25 Therefore when they agreed not among themselues, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, to wit, Well spake the holy Ghost by Esaias the Prophet vnto our fathers, 
\v 26 Saying, Goe vnto this people, and say, By hearing ye shall heare, and shall not vnderstand, and seeing ye shall see, and not perceiue. 
\v 27 For the heart of this people is waxed fatte, and their eares are dull of hearing, and with their eyes haue they winked, least they shoulde see with their eyes, and heare with their eares, and vnderstand with their heartes, and should returne that I might heale them. 
\v 28 Be it knowen therefore vnto you, that this saluation of God is sent to the Gentiles, and they shall heare it. 
\v 29 And when he had saide these things, the Iewes departed, and had great reasoning among themselues. 
\v 30 And Paul remained two yeeres full in an house hired for himselfe, and receiued all that came in vnto him, 
\v 31 Preaching the kingdome of God, and teaching those things which concerne the Lord Iesus Christ, with all boldnesse of speache, without let.
