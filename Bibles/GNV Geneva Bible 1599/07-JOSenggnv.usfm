\v 1 Nowe after the death of Moses the seruant of the Lord, the Lord spake vnto Ioshua the sonne of Nun, Moses minister, saying, 
\v 2 Moses my seruant is dead: nowe therefore arise, go ouer this Iorden, thou, and all this people, vnto the lande which I giue them, that is, to ye children of Israel. 
\v 3 Euery place that the sole of your foote shall treade vpon, haue I giuen you, as I said vnto Moses. 
\v 4 From the wildernesse and this Lebanon euen vnto the great riuer, the riuer Perath: all the land of the Hittites, euen vnto the great Sea towarde the going downe of the sunne, shalbe your coast. 
\v 5 There shall not a man be able to withstande thee all the dayes of thy life: as I was with Moses, so will I be with thee: I will not leaue thee, nor forsake thee. 
\v 6 Be strong and of a good courage: for vnto this people shalt thou deuide the lande for an inheritance, which I sware vnto their fathers to giue them. 
\v 7 Onely be thou strong, and of a most valiant courage, that thou mayest obserue and doe according to all the Lawe which Moses my seruant hath commanded thee: thou shalt not turne away from it to the right hande, nor to the left, that thou mayest prosper whithersoeuer thou goest. 
\v 8 Let not this booke of the Law depart out of thy mouth, but meditate therin day and night, that thou mayest obserue and doe according to all that is written therein: for then shalt thou make thy way prosperous, and then shalt thou haue good successe. 
\v 9 Haue not I commanded thee, saying, Be strong and of a good courage, feare not, nor be discouraged? for I the Lord thy God will be with thee, whithersoeuer thou goest. 
\v 10 Then Ioshua commanded the officers of the people, saying, 
\v 11 Passe through the hoste, and commande the people, saying, Prepare you vitailes: for after three dayes ye shall passe ouer this Iorden, to goe in to possesse the lande, which the Lord your God giueth you to possesse it. 
\v 12 And vnto the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to halfe the tribe of Manasseh spake Ioshua, saying, 
\v 13 Remember the worde, which Moses the seruant of the Lord commanded you, saying, The Lord your God hath giuen you rest, and hath giuen you this land. 
\v 14 Your wiues, your children, and your cattell shall remaine in the land which Moses gaue you on this side Iorden: but ye shall goe ouer before your brethren armed, all that be men of warre, and shall helpe them, 
\v 15 Vntill the Lord haue giuen your brethren rest, as well as to you, and vntill they also shall possesse the land, which the Lord your God giueth them: then shall ye returne vnto the lande of your possession and shall possesse it, which land Moses the Lordes seruant gaue you on this side Iorden toward the sunne rising. 
\v 16 Then they answered Ioshua, saying, Al that thou hast commanded vs, we will doe, and whithersoeuer thou sendest vs, we will goe. 
\v 17 As we obeyed Moses in all things, so will we obey thee: onely the Lord thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses. 
\v 18 Whosoeuer shall rebell against thy commandement, and will not obey thy wordes in all that thou commaundest him, let him bee put to death: onely be strong and of good courage.

\p
\v 1 Then Ioshua the sonne of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spie secretly, saying, Go, view the land, and also Iericho: and they went, and came into an harlots house, named Rahab, and lodged there. 
\v 2 Then report was made to the King of Iericho, saying, Beholde, there came men hither to night, of the children of Israel, to spie out the countrey. 
\v 3 And the King of Iericho sent vnto Rahab, saying, Bring foorth the men that are come to thee, and which are entred into thine house: for they be come to search out all the land. 
\v 4 (But ye woman had taken the two men, and hid them) Therefore saide she thus, There came men vnto me, but I wist not whence they were. 
\v 5 And when they shut the gate in the darke, the men went out, whither the men went I wote not: follow ye after them quickly, for ye shall ouertake them. 
\v 6 (But she had brought them vp to the roofe of the house, and hidde them with the stalkes of flaxe, which she had spread abroad vpon the roofe) 
\v 7 And certaine men pursued after them, the way to Iorden, vnto the foordes, and as soone as they which pursued after them, were gone out, they shut the gate. 
\v 8 And before they were a sleepe, she came vp vnto them vpon the roofe, 
\v 9 And saide vnto the men, I knowe that the Lord hath giuen you the land, and that the feare of you is fallen vpon vs, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you. 
\v 10 For we haue heard, howe the Lord dried vp the water of the redde Sea before you, when you came out of Egypt, and what you did vnto the two Kings of the Amorites, that were on the other side Iorden, vnto Sihon and to Og, whom ye vtterly destroyed: 
\v 11 And when wee heard it, our heartes did faint, and there remained no more courage in any because of you: for the Lord your God, he is the God in heauen aboue, and in earth beneath. 
\v 12 Now therefore, I pray you, sweare vnto me by the Lord; that as I haue shewed you mercie, ye will also shewe mercie vnto my fathers house, and giue me a true token, 
\v 13 And that yee will saue aliue my father and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they haue: and that yee will deliuer our soules from death. 
\v 14 And the men answered her, Our life for you to die, if ye vtter not this our businesse: and when the Lord hath giuen vs the lande, we will deale mercifully and truely with thee. 
\v 15 Then she let them downe by a corde thorowe the windowe: for her house was vpon the towne wall, and she dwelt vpon the wall. 
\v 16 And she said vnto them, Goe you into the mountaine, least the pursuers meete with you, and hide your selues there three dayes, vntill the pursuers be returned: then afterwarde may yee goe your way. 
\v 17 And the men said vnto her, We will be blamelesse of this thine othe, which thou hast made vs sweare. 
\v 18 Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this cord of red threde in the window, whereby thou lettest vs downe, and thou shalt bring thy father and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy fathers houshold home to thee. 
\v 19 And whosoeuer then doeth goe out at the doores of thine house into the streete, his blood shalbe vpon his head, and we will be giltlesse: but whosoeuer shall be with thee in the house, his blood shalbe on our head, if any hande touch him: 
\v 20 And if thou vtter this our matter, we will be quite of thine othe, which thou hast made vs sweare. 
\v 21 And she answered, According vnto your wordes, so be it: then she sent them away, and they departed, and she bound the red cord in ye window. 
\v 22 And they departed, and came into the mountaine, and there abode three dayes, vntil the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but founde them not. 
\v 23 So the two men returned, and descended from the mountaine, and passed ouer, and came to Ioshua the sonne of Nun, and tolde him all things that came vnto them. 
\v 24 Also they saide vnto Ioshua, Surely the Lord hath deliuered into our handes all the lande: for euen all the inhabitants of the countrey faint because of vs. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 Then Ioshua rose very earely, and they remoued from Shittim, and came to Iorden, he, and all the children of Israel, and lodged there, before they went ouer. 
\v 2 And after three dayes the officers went throughout the hoste, 
\v 3 And commanded the people, saying, When ye see the Arke of the couenat of the Lord your God, and the Priestes of the Leuites bearing it, ye shall depart from your place, and goe after it. 
\v 4 Yet there shalbe a space betweene you and it, about two thousande cubites by measure: ye shall not come neere vnto it, that ye may knowe the way, by the which ye shall goe: for ye haue not gone this way in times past. 
\v 5 (Nowe Ioshua had saide vnto the people, Sanctifie your selues: for to morowe the Lord will doe wonders among you) 
\v 6 Also Ioshua spake vnto the Priestes, saying, Take vp the Arke of the couenant, and goe ouer before the people: so they tooke vp the Arke of the couenant, and went before the people. 
\v 7 Then the Lord saide vnto Ioshua, This day will I begin to magnifie thee in the sight of all Israel, which shall knowe, that as I was with Moses, so will I be with thee. 
\v 8 Thou shalt therefore command the Priests that beare the Arke of the Couenant, saying, When ye are come to the brinke of the waters of Iorden, ye shall stande still in Iorden. 
\v 9 Then Ioshua said vnto the children of Israel, Come hither, and heare the wordes of the Lord your God. 
\v 10 And Ioshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the liuing God is among you, and that he will certainely cast out before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hiuites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Iebusites. 
\v 11 Beholde, the Arke of the couenant of the Lord of all the worlde passeth before you into Iorden. 
\v 12 Nowe therefore take from among you twelue men out of the tribes of Israel, out of euery tribe a man. 
\v 13 And assoone as the soles of the feete of the Priestes (that beare the Arke of the Lord God the Lord of all the worlde) shall stay in the waters of Iorden, the waters of Iorden shall be cut off: for the waters that come from aboue, shall stande still vpon an heape. 
\v 14 Then when the people were departed from their tentes to goe ouer Iorden, the Priestes bearing the Arke of the Couenant, went before people. 
\v 15 And as they that bare the Arke came vnto Iorden, and the feete of the Priestes that bare the Arke were dipped in the brinke of the water, (for Iorden vseth to fill all his bankes all the time of haruest) 
\v 16 Then the waters that came downe from aboue, stayed and rose vpon an heape and departed farre from the citie of Adam, that was beside Zaretan: but the waters that came downe towarde the Sea of the wildernes, euen the salt Sea, failed, and were cut off: so the people went right ouer against Iericho. 
\v 17 But the Priestes that bare the Arke of the couenant of the Lord, stoode drie within Iorden readie prepared, and all the Israelites went ouer dry, vntill all the people were gone cleane ouer through Iorden. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 And when all the people were wholy gone ouer Iorden, (after the Lord had spoken vnto Ioshua, saying, 
\v 2 Take you twelue me out of the people, out of euery tribe a man, 
\v 3 And command you them, saying, Take you hence out of the middes of Iorden, out of the place where the Priestes stoode in a readinesse, twelue stones, which ye shall take away with you, and leaue them in the lodging where you shall lodge this night) 
\v 4 Then Ioshua called the twelue men, whome he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of euery tribe a man, 
\v 5 And Ioshua said vnto them, Go ouer before the Arke of the Lord your God, euen through the middes of Iorden, and take vp euery man of you a stone vpon his shoulder according vnto the nomber of the tribes of the children of Israel, 
\v 6 That this may bee a signe among you, that whe your children shall aske their fathers in time to come, saying, What meane you by these stones? 
\v 7 Then ye may answere them, That the waters of Iorden were cut off before the Arke of the couenant of the Lord: for when it passed through Iorden, the waters of Iorden were cut off: therefore these stones are a memoriall vnto the children of Israel for euer. 
\v 8 Then ye children of Israel did euen so as Ioshua had commanded, and tooke vp twelue stones out of the mids of Iorden as ye Lord had said vnto Ioshua, according to the nomber of the tribes of the children of Israel, and caried them away with them vnto the lodging, and layd them down there. 
\v 9 And Ioshua set vp twelue stones in the middes of Iorden, in the place where the feete of the Priests, which bare the Arke of the couenant stood, and there haue they continued vnto this day. 
\v 10 So the Priests, which bare ye Arke, stoode in the middes of Iorden, vntill euery thing was finished that ye Lord had comanded Ioshua to say vnto the people, according to all that Moses charged Ioshua: then the people hasted and went ouer. 
\v 11 When all the people were cleane passed ouer, the Arke of the Lord went ouer also, and the Priests before the people. 
\v 12 And the sonnes of Reuben, and the sonnes of Gad, and halfe the tribe of Manasseh went ouer before the children of Israel armed, as Moses had charged them. 
\v 13 Euen fourty thousand prepared for warre, went before the Lord vnto battel, into ye plaine of Iericho. 
\v 14 That day the Lord magnified Ioshua in the sight of all Israel, and they feared him, as they feared Moses all dayes of his life. 
\v 15 And the Lord spake vnto Ioshua, saying, 
\v 16 Commande the Priests that beare ye Arke of the testimonie, to come vp out of Iorden. 
\v 17 Ioshua therefore commanded the Priests, saying, Come ye vp out of Iorden. 
\v 18 And when the Priests that bare the Arke of the couenant of ye Lord were come vp out of the middes of Iorden, and assoone as the soles of the Priests feete were set on the dry land, the waters of Iorde returned vnto their place, and flowed ouer all the bankes thereof, as they did before. 
\v 19 So the people came vp out of Iorden the tenth day of the first moneth, and pitched in Gilgal, in the Eastside of Iericho. 
\v 20 Also the twelue stones, which they tooke out of Iorden, did Ioshua pitch in Gilgal. 
\v 21 And he spake vnto ye childre of Israel, saying, When your children shall aske their fathers in time to come, and say, What meane these stones? 
\v 22 Then ye shall shew your children, and say, Israel came ouer this Iorden on dry land: 
\v 23 For the Lord your God dryed vp ye waters of Iorden before you, vntill ye were gone ouer, as the Lord your God did the red Sea, which hee dryed vp before vs, till we were gone ouer, 
\v 24 That all the people of the worlde may know that the hand of the Lord is mightie, that ye might feare the Lord your God continually. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 Nowe when all the Kings of the Amorites, which were beyond Iorden Westward, and all the Kinges of the Canaanites which were by the Sea, heard that the Lord had dried vp the waters of Iorden before the children of Israel vntill they were gone ouer, their heart fainted: and there was no courage in them any more because of the children of Israel. 
\v 2 That same time the Lord said vnto Ioshua, Make thee sharpe kniues, and returne, and circumcise the sonnes of Israel the second time. 
\v 3 Then Ioshua made him sharpe kniues and circumcised the sonnes of Israel in the hill of the foreskinnes. 
\v 4 And this is the cause why Ioshua circumcised all the people, euen the males that came out of Egypt, because all the men of warre were dead in the wildernesse by the way after they came out of Egypt. 
\v 5 For all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the people that were borne in the wildernes by the way after they came out of Egypt, were not circumcised. 
\v 6 For the children of Israel walked fourtie yeres in the wildernes, till all the people of the men of warre that came out of Egypt were consumed, because they obeyed not the voyce of the Lord: vnto whome the Lord sware, that he would not shewe them the lande, which the Lord had sworne vnto their fathers, that he would giue vs, euen a land that floweth with milke and hony. 
\v 7 So their sonnes whome he raysed vp in their steade, Ioshua circumcised: for they were vncircumcised, because they circumcised them not by the way. 
\v 8 And when they had made an ende of circumcising al the people, they abode in the places in the campe till they were whole. 
\v 9 After, the Lord said vnto Ioshua, This day I haue taken away the shame of Egypt from you: wherefore he called the name of that place Gilgal, vnto this day. 
\v 10 So the children of Israel abode in Gilgal, and kept ye feast of the Passeouer the fourteenth day of the moneth at euen in ye plaine of Iericho. 
\v 11 And they did eat of the corne of the land, on the morow after the Passeouer, vnleauened breade, and parched corne in the same day. 
\v 12 And the MAN ceased on the morowe after they had eaten of the corne of the land, neither had the children of Israel MAN any more, but did eate of the fruite of the land of Canaan that yeere. 
\v 13 And when Ioshua was by Iericho, he lift vp his eyes and looked: and behold, there stood a man against him, hauing a sword drawen in his hand: and Ioshua went vnto him, and said vnto him, Art thou on our side, or on our aduersaries? 
\v 14 And he said, Nay, but as a captaine of the host of the Lord am I nowe come: then Ioshua fel on his face to the earth, and did worship, and saide vnto him, What sayth my Lord vnto his seruant? 
\v 15 And the captaine of ye Lords host said vnto Ioshua, Loose thy shoe of thy foote: for ye place wheron thou standest, is holy: and Ioshua did so. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1 Now Iericho was shut vp, and closed, because of the children of Israel: none might go out nor enter in. 
\v 2 And the Lord saide vnto Ioshua, Behold, I haue giuen into thine hand Iericho and the King thereof, and the strong men of warre. 
\v 3 All ye therefore that be men of warre, shall compasse the citie, in going round about the citie once: thus shall you doe sixe dayes: 
\v 4 And seuen Priests shall beare seuen trumpets of rams hornes before the Arke: and the seuenth day ye shall compasse the citie seuen times, and the Priests shall blow with the trumpets. 
\v 5 And when they make a long blast with the rams horne, and ye heare the sound of the trumpet, al the people shall shoute with a great shoute: then shall the wall of the citie fall downe flat, and the people shall ascend vp, euery man streight before him. 
\v 6 Then, Ioshua the sonne of Nun called the Priests and said vnto them, Take vp the Arke of the couenant, and let seuen Priests beare seuen trumpets of rams hornes before the Arke of the Lord. 
\v 7 But he said vnto the people, Goe and compasse the citie: and let him that is armed, go forth before the Arke of the Lord. 
\v 8 And when Ioshua had spoken vnto the people, the seuen Priestes bare the seuen trumpets of rams hornes, and went foorth before the Arke of the Lord, and blew with the trumpets, and the Arke of the couenant of ye Lord followed them. 
\v 9 And the men of armes went before the Priestes, that blewe the trumpets: then the gathering hoste came after the Arke, as they went and blewe the trumpets. 
\v 10 (Nowe Ioshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall nor shout, neither make any noyse with your voyce, neither shall a worde proceede out of your mouth, vntill the day that I say vnto you, Shout, then shall ye shoute) 
\v 11 So the Arke of the Lord compassed the citie, and went about it once: then they returned into the hoaste, and lodged in the campe. 
\v 12 And Ioshua rose early in the morning, and the Priestes bare the Arke of the Lord: 
\v 13 Also seuen Priests bare seuen trumpets of rams hornes, and went before the Arke of the Lord, and going blewe with the trumpets: and the men of armes went before them, but the gathering hoste came after the Arke of the Lord, as they went and blewe the trumpets. 
\v 14 And the second day they compassed the citie once, and returned into the host: thus they did sixe dayes. 
\v 15 And when the seuenth day came, they rose early, euen with the dawning of the day, and compassed the citie after ye same maner seuen times: only that day they compassed the citie seuen times. 
\v 16 And when the Priests had blowen ye trumpets the seuenth time, Ioshua said vnto ye people, Shoute: for the Lord hath giuen you the citie. 
\v 17 And the citie shalbe an execrable thing, both it, and all that are therein, vnto the Lord: onely Rahab the harlot shall liue, shee, and all that are with her in the house: for shee hid the messengers that we sent. 
\v 18 Notwithstanding, be ye ware of the execrable thing, lest ye make your selues execrable, and in taking of the execrable thing, make also the hoste of Israel execrable, and trouble it. 
\v 19 But all siluer, and gold, and vessels of brasse, and yron shalbe consecrate vnto the Lord, and shall come into the Lordes treasury. 
\v 20 So the people shouted, whe they had blowen trumpets: for when the people had heard the sound of the trumpet, they shouted with a great shoute: and the wall fel downe flat: so the people went vp into the citie, euery man streight before him: and they tooke the citie. 
\v 21 And they vtterly destroyed all that was in the citie, both man and woman, yong, and olde, and oxe, and sheepe, and asse, with the edge of the sword. 
\v 22 But Ioshua had said vnto the two men that had spied out the countrey, Go into the harlots house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware to her. 
\v 23 So the yong men that were spies, went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that shee had: also they brought out all her familie, and put them without the host of Israel. 
\v 24 After they burnt the citie with fire, and all that was therein: onely the siluer and the gold, and the vessels of brasse and yron, they put vnto the treasure of the house of the Lord. 
\v 25 So Ioshua saued Rahab the harlot, and her fathers houshold, and all that shee had; and shee dwelt in Israel euen vnto this day, because shee had hid the messengers, which Ioshua sent to spie out Iericho. 
\v 26 And Ioshua sware at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before ye Lord, that riseth vp, and buildeth this citie Iericho: hee shall lay the foundation thereof in his eldest sonne, and in his yongest sonne shall hee set vp the gates of it. 
\v 27 So the Lord was with Ioshua, and he was famous through all the world. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1 But the children of Israel committed a trespasse in the excommunicate thing: for Achan the sonne of Carmi, the sonne of Zabdi, the sonne of Zerah of the tribe of Iuda tooke of the excommunicate thing: wherfore the wrath of the Lord was kindled against the children of Israel. 
\v 2 And Ioshua sent men from Iericho to Ai, which is beside Bethauen, on ye East side of Bethel, and spake vnto them, saying, Goe vp, and view the countrey. And ye men went vp, and viewed Ai, 
\v 3 And returned to Ioshua, and saide vnto him, Let not al the people go vp, but let as it were two or three thousand men go vp, and smite Ai, and make not al the people to labour thither, for they are fewe. 
\v 4 So there went vp thither of the people about three thousande men, and they fledde before the men of Ai. 
\v 5 And the men of Ai smote of them vpon a thirtie and sixe men: for they chased them from before the gate vnto Shebarim, and smote them in the going downe: wherfore the heartes of the people melted away like water. 
\v 6 Then Ioshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth vpon his face before the Arke of the Lord, vntill the euentide, he, and the Elders of Israel, and put dust vpon their heads. 
\v 7 And Ioshua said, Alas, O Lord God, wherefore hast thou brought this people ouer Iorden, to deliuer vs into the hande of the Amorites, and to destroye vs? would God we had bene content to dwell on the other side Iorden. 
\v 8 Oh Lord, what shall I say, when Israel turne their backes before their enemies? 
\v 9 For the Canaanites, and all the inhabitants of the land shall heare of it, and shall compasse vs, and destroy our name out of the earth: and what wilt thou doe vnto thy mightie Name? 
\v 10 And the Lord said vnto Ioshua, Get thee vp: wherefore lyest thou thus vpon thy face? 
\v 11 Israel hath sinned, and they haue transgressed my couenant, which I commanded them: for they haue euen taken of the excommunicate thing, and haue also stollen, and dissembled also, and haue put it euen with their owne stuffe. 
\v 12 Therefore ye children of Israel cannot stand before their enemies, but haue turned their backes before their enemies, because they be execrable: neither will I bee with you any more, except ye destroy the excommunicate from among you. 
\v 13 Vp therefore, sanctifie the people, and say, Sanctifie your selues against to morowe: for thus saith the Lord God of Israel, There is an execrable thing among you, O Israel, therefore ye cannot stand against your enemies, vntill ye haue put the execrable thing from among you. 
\v 14 In the morning therefore ye shall come according to your tribes, and the tribe which the Lord taketh, shall come according to the families: and the familie which the Lord shall take, shall come by the housholds: and the houshold which the Lord shall take, shall come man by man. 
\v 15 And he that is taken with the excommunicate thing, shall be burnt with fire, hee, and all that he hath, because he hath transgressed the couenant of the Lord, and because he hath wrought folly in Israel. 
\v 16 So Ioshua rose vp earely in the morning and brought Israel by their tribes: and the tribe of Iudah was taken. 
\v 17 And he brought the families of Iudah, and tooke the familie of the Zarhites, and he brought the familie of the Zarhites, man by man, and Zabdi was taken. 
\v 18 And he brought his houshold, man by man, and Achan ye sonne of Carmi, the sonne of Zabdi, the sonne of Zerah of the tribe of Iudah was take. 
\v 19 Then Ioshua said vnto Achan, My sonne, I beseech thee, giue glory to the Lord God of Israel, and make confession vnto him, and shewe me now what thou hast done: hide it not from me. 
\v 20 And Achan answered Ioshua, and saide, In deede, I haue sinned against the Lord God of Israel, and thus, and thus haue I done. 
\v 21 I sawe among the spoyle a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundreth shekels of siluer, and a wedge of golde of fiftie shekels weight, and I coueted them, and tooke them: and behold, they lye hid in the earth in the mids of my tent, and the siluer vnder it. 
\v 22 Then Ioshua sent messengers, which ran vnto the tent, and beholde, it was hid in his tent, and the siluer vnder it. 
\v 23 Therefore they tooke them out of the tent, and brought them vnto Ioshua, and vnto all the children of Israel, and layd them before the Lord. 
\v 24 Then Ioshua tooke Achan the sonne of Zerah, and the siluer, and the garment and the wedge of golde and his sonnes, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheepe, and his tent, and all that hee had: and all Israel with him brought them vnto the valley of Achor. 
\v 25 And Ioshua said, In as much as thou hast troubled vs, the Lord shall trouble thee this day: and all Israel threwe stones at him, and burned them with fire, and stoned them with stones. 
\v 26 And they cast vpon him a great heape of stones vnto this day: and so the Lord turned from his fierce wrath: therefore hee called the name of that place, The valley of Achor, vnto this day. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1 After, the Lord saide vnto Ioshua, Feare not, neither bee thou faint hearted: take all the men of warre with thee and arise, go vp to Ai: beholde, I haue giuen into thine hand the King of Ai, and his people, and his citie, and his land. 
\v 2 And thou shalt doe to Ai and to the King thereof, as thou didst vnto Iericho and to the King thereof: neuerthelesse the spoyle thereof and the cattell thereof shall ye take vnto you for a praye: thou shalt lye in wait against the citie on the backside thereof. 
\v 3 Then Ioshua arose, and all the men of warre to goe vp against Ai: and Ioshua chose out thirtie thousand strong men, and valiant, and sent them away by night. 
\v 4 And he commanded them, saying, Behold, yee shall lye in waite against the citie on the backeside of the citie: goe not very farre from the citie, but be ye all in a readinesse. 
\v 5 And I and all the people that are with me, will approche vnto the citie: and when they shall come out against vs, as they did at the first time, then will we flee before them. 
\v 6 For they wil come out after vs, till we haue brought them out of the citie: for they will say, They flee before vs as at the first time: so we will flee before them. 
\v 7 Then you shall rise vp from lying in waite and destroy the citie: for the Lord your God wil deliuer it into your hand. 
\v 8 And when ye haue taken the citie, ye shall set it on fire: according to the commandement of the Lord shall ye do: behold, I haue charged you. 
\v 9 Ioshua then sent them foorth, and they went to lye in waite, and abode betweene Beth-el and Ai, on the Westside of Ai: but Ioshua lodged that night among the people. 
\v 10 And Ioshua rose vp early in the morning, and nombred the people: and he and the Elders of Israel went vp before the people against Ai. 
\v 11 Also all the men of warre that were with him went vp and drewe neere, and came against the citie, and pitched on the Northside of Ai: and there was a valley betweene them and Ai. 
\v 12 And hee tooke about fiue thousande men, and set them to lye in waite betweene Beth-el and Ai, on the Westside of the citie. 
\v 13 And the people set all the hoste that was on the Northside against the citie, and the liers in waite on the West, against the citie: and Ioshua went the same night into the mids of the valley. 
\v 14 And when the King of Ai sawe it, then the men of the citie hasted and rose vp earely, and went out against Israel to battell, hee and all his people at the time appointed, before the plaine: for he knew not that any lay in waite against him on the backeside of the citie. 
\v 15 Then Ioshua and all Israel as beaten before them, fled by the way of the wildernes. 
\v 16 And all the people of the citie were called together, to pursue after them: and they pursued after Ioshua, and were drawen away out of the city, 
\v 17 So that there was not a man left in Ai, nor in Beth-el, that went not out after Israel: and they left the citie open, and pursued after Israel. 
\v 18 Then the Lord said vnto Ioshua, Stretch out the speare that is in thine hande, towarde Ai: for I wil giue it into thine hand: and Ioshua stretched out the speare that hee had in his hand, toward the citie. 
\v 19 And they that lay in wait, arose quickly out of their place, and ranne as soone as he had stretched out his hand, and they entred into the citie, and tooke it, and hasted, and set the citie on fire. 
\v 20 And the men of Ai looked behinde them, and sawe it: for loe, the smoke of the citie ascended vp to heauen, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: for the people that fled to the wildernesse, turned backe vpon the pursuers. 
\v 21 When Ioshua and all Israel sawe that they that lay in waite, had taken the citie, and that the smoke of the citie mounted vp, then they turned againe and slewe the men of Ai. 
\v 22 Also the other issued out of the citie against them: so were they in the middes of Israel, these being on the one side, and the rest on the other side: and they slewe them, so that they let none of them remaine nor escape. 
\v 23 And the King of Ai they tooke aliue, and brought him to Ioshua. 
\v 24 And when Israel had made an ende of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the fielde, that is, in the wildernesse, where they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sworde, vntill they were consumed, all the Israelites returned vnto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sworde. 
\v 25 And all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelue thousande, euen all the men of Ai. 
\v 26 For Ioshua drewe not his hande backe againe which he had stretched out with the speare, vntill hee had vtterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai. 
\v 27 Onely the cattell and the spoyle of this citie, Israel tooke for a praye vnto themselues, according vnto the worde of the Lord, which hee commanded Ioshua. 
\v 28 And Ioshua burnt Ai, and made it an heape for euer, and a wildernes vnto this day. 
\v 29 And the King of Ai hee hanged on a tree, vnto the euening. And as soone as the sunne was down, Ioshua commanded that they should take his carkeis downe from the tree, and cast it at the entring of ye gate of the city, and lay thereon a great heape of stones, that remaineth vnto this day. 
\v 30 Then Ioshua built an altar vnto the Lord God of Israel, in mount Ebal, 
\v 31 As Moses the seruant of the Lord had commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the booke of the Lawe of Moses, an altar of whole stone, ouer which no man had lift an yron: and they offered thereon burnt offrings vnto the Lord, and sacrificed peace offerings. 
\v 32 Also he wrote there vpon the stones, a rehearsall of the Lawe of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel. 
\v 33 And all Israel (and their Elders, and officers and their iudges stoode on this side of the Arke, and on that side, before the Priestes of the Leuites, which bare the Arke of the couenant of the Lord) as well the stranger, as he that is borne in the countrey: halfe of them were ouer against mount Gerizim, and halfe of them ouer against mount Ebal, as Moses the seruant of the Lord had commanded before, that they should blesse the people of Israel. 
\v 34 Then afterwarde hee read all the wordes of the Lawe, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the booke of the Lawe. 
\v 35 There was not a worde of all that Moses had commanded, which Ioshua read not before all the Congregation of Israel, as well before the women and the children, as the stranger that was conuersant among them. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 And when all the Kings that were beyonde Iorden, in the mountaines and in the valleis, and by all the coastes of the great Sea ouer against Lebanon (as the Hittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hiuites, and the Iebusites) heard thereof, 
\v 2 They gathered themselues together, to fight against Ioshua, and against Israel with one accord. 
\v 3 But the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Ioshua had done vnto Iericho, and to Ai. 
\v 4 And therefore they wrought craftily: for they went, and fayned themselues ambassadours, and tooke olde sackes vpon their asses, and olde bottels for wine, both rent and bound vp, 
\v 5 And olde shoes and clouted vpon their feete: also the raiment vpon them was old, and all their prouision of bread was dried, and mouled. 
\v 6 So they came vnto Ioshua into the hoste to Gilgal, and said vnto him, and vnto the men of Israel, Wee be come from a farre countrey: nowe therefore make a league with vs. 
\v 7 Then the men of Israel said vnto the Hiuites, It may be that thou dwellest among vs, how then can I make a league with thee? 
\v 8 And they said vnto Ioshua, We are thy seruants. Then Ioshua saide vnto them, Who are ye? and whence come ye? 
\v 9 And they answered him, From a very farre countrey thy seruants are come for the Name of the Lord thy God: for we haue heard his fame and all that he hath done in Egypt, 
\v 10 And all that he hath done to the two Kings of the Amorites that were beyonde Iorden, to Sihon King of Heshbon, and to Og King of Bashan, which were at Ashtaroth. 
\v 11 Wherefore our elders, and all the inhabitants of our countrey spake to vs, saying, Take vitailes with you for the iourney, and go to meete them, and say vnto them, Wee are your seruants: now therefore make ye a league with vs. 
\v 12 This our bread we tooke it hote with vs for vittailes out of our houses, the day we departed to come vnto you: but nowe beholde, it is dried, and it is mouled. 
\v 13 Also these bottels of wine which we filled, were newe, and lo, they be rent, and these our garments and our shooes are olde, by reason of the exceeding great iourney. 
\v 14 And the men accepted their tale concerning their vittailes, and counselled not with the mouth of the Lord. 
\v 15 So Ioshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, that he would suffer them to liue: also the Princes of the Congregation sware vnto them. 
\v 16 But at the end of three dayes, after they had made a league with them, they heard that they were their neighbours, and that they dwelt among them. 
\v 17 And the children of Israel tooke their iourney, and came vnto their cities the third day, and their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth and Kiriath-iearim. 
\v 18 And the children of Israel slewe them not, because the Princes of the Congregation had sworne vnto them by the Lord God of Israel: wherefore all the Congregation murmured against the Princes. 
\v 19 Then all the Princes said vnto all the Congregation, We haue sworne vnto them by the Lord God of Israel: nowe therefore we may not touch them. 
\v 20 But this we wil doe to them, and let them liue, least the wrath be vpon vs because of the othe which we sware vnto them. 
\v 21 And the Princes sayd vnto them againe, Let them liue, but they shall hewe wood, and drawe water vnto all the Congregation, as the Princes appoint them. 
\v 22 Ioshua then called them, and talked with them, and sayd, Wherefore haue ye beguiled vs, saying, We are very farre from you, when ye dwel among vs? 
\v 23 Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood, and drawers of water for the house of my God. 
\v 24 And they answered Ioshua, and sayd, Because it was tolde thy seruants, that the Lord thy God had commanded his seruant Moses to giue you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land out of your sight, therefore we were exceeding sore afraid for our liues at the presence of you, and haue done this thing: 
\v 25 And beholde nowe, we are in thine hand: doe as it seemeth good and right in thine eyes to doe vnto vs. 
\v 26 Euen so did he vnto them, and deliuered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slewe them not. 
\v 27 And Ioshua appointed them that same day to be hewers of wood, and drawers of water for the Congregation, and for the altar of the Lord vnto this day, in the place which he should chuse. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1 Now when Adoni-zedek King of Ierusalem had heard how Ioshua had taken Ai and had destroyed it, (for as he had done to Iericho and to the King thereof, so he had done to Ai and to the King thereof) and howe the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them, 
\v 2 Then they feared exceedingly: for Gibeon was a great citie, as one of the royall cities: for it was greater then Ai, and all the men thereof were mightie. 
\v 3 Wherefore Adoni-zedek King of Ierusalem sent vnto Hoham King of Hebron, and vnto Piram King of Iarmuth, and vnto Iapia King of Lachish, and vnto Debir King of Eglon, saying, 
\v 4 Come vp vnto me, and helpe me, that we may smite Gibeon: for they haue made peace with Ioshua and with the children of Israel. 
\v 5 Therefore the fiue Kings of the Amorites, the King of Ierusalem, the King of Hebron, the King of Iarmuth, the King of Lachish, and the King of Eglon gathered themselues together, and went vp, they with all their hostes, and besieged Gibeon, and made warre against it. 
\v 6 And the men of Gibeon sent vnto Ioshua, euen to the hoste to Gilgal, saying, Withdrawe not thine hand from thy seruants: come vp to vs quickly, and saue vs, and helpe vs: for all the Kings of the Amorites which dwell in the mountaines, are gathered together against vs. 
\v 7 So Ioshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of warre with him, and all the men of might. 
\v 8 And the Lord sayd vnto Ioshua, Feare them not: for I haue giuen them into thine hand: none of them shall stand against thee. 
\v 9 Ioshua therefore came vnto them suddenly: for he went vp from Gilgal all the night. 
\v 10 And the Lord discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth vp to Beth-horon, and smote them to Azekah and to Makkedah. 
\v 11 And as they fled from before Israel, and were in the going downe to Beth-horon, the Lord cast downe great stones from heauen vpon them, vntill Azekah, and they dyed: they were more that dyed with the hailestones, then they whom the children of Israel slewe with the sword. 
\v 12 Then spake Ioshua to the Lord, in the day when the Lord gaue the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he sayd in the sight of Israel, Sunne, stay thou in Gibeon, and thou moone, in the valley of Aialon. 
\v 13 And the Sunne abode, and the moone stood still, vntill the people auenged themselues vpon their enemies: (Is not this written in the booke of Iasher?) so the Sunne abode in the middes of the heauen, and hasted not to goe downe for a whole day. 
\v 14 And there was no day like that before it, nor after it, that the Lord heard the voyce of a man: for the Lord fought for Israel. 
\v 15 After, Ioshua returned, and all Israel with him vnto the campe to Gilgal: 
\v 16 But the fiue Kings fled and were hid in a caue at Makkedah. 
\v 17 And it was tolde Ioshua, saying, The fiue Kings are found hid in a caue at Makkedah. 
\v 18 Then Ioshua said, Roule great stones vpon the mouth of the caue, and set men by it for to keepe them. 
\v 19 But stand ye not still: follow after your enemies, and smite all the hindmost, suffer them not to enter into their cities: for the Lord your God hath giuen them into your hand. 
\v 20 And when Ioshua and the children of Israel had made an ende of slaying them with an exceeding great slaughter till they were consumed, and the rest that remained of them were entred into walled cities, 
\v 21 Then all the people returned to the campe, to Ioshua at Makkedah in peace: no man mooued his tongue against the children of Israel. 
\v 22 After, Ioshua sayd, Open the mouth of the caue, and bring out these fiue Kings vnto me forth of the caue. 
\v 23 And they did so, and brought out those fiue Kings vnto him forth of the caue, euen the King of Ierusalem, the King of Hebron, ye King of Iarmuth, the King of Lachish, and the King of Eglon. 
\v 24 And when they had brought out those Kings vnto Ioshua, Ioshua called for all the men of Israel, and sayd vnto the chiefe of the men of warre, which went with him, Come neere, set your feete vpon the necks of these Kings: and they came neere and set their feete vpon their necks. 
\v 25 And Ioshua sayd vnto them, Feare not, nor be faint hearted, but be strong and of a good courage: for thus will the Lord doe to all your enemies, against whome ye fight. 
\v 26 So then Ioshua smote them, and slewe them, and hanged them on fiue trees, and they hanged still vpon the trees vntill the euening. 
\v 27 And at the going downe of the sunne, Ioshua gaue commandement, that they should take them downe off the trees, and cast them into the caue (wherein they had bene hid) and they layde great stones vpon the caues mouth, which remaine vntill this day. 
\v 28 And that same day Ioshua tooke Makkedah and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the King thereof destroyed he with them, and all the soules that were therein, he let none remaine: for hee did to the King of Makkedah as he had done vnto the King of Iericho. 
\v 29 Then Ioshua went from Makkedah, and all Israel with him vnto Libnah, and fought against Libnah. 
\v 30 And the Lord gaue it also and the King thereof into the hand of Israel: and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the soules that were therein: he let none remaine in it: for he did vnto the King thereof, as he had done vnto the King of Iericho. 
\v 31 And Ioshua departed from Libnah, and all Israel with him vnto Lachish, and besieged it, and assaulted it. 
\v 32 And the Lord gaue Lachish into the hand of Israel, which tooke it the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the soules that were therein, according to all as he had done to Libnah. 
\v 33 Then Horam King of Gezer came vp to helpe Lachish: but Ioshua smote him and his people, vntill none of his remained. 
\v 34 And from Lachish Ioshua departed vnto Eglon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged it, and assaulted it, 
\v 35 And they tooke it the same day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the soules that were therein he vtterly destroyed the same day, according to all that he had done to Lachish. 
\v 36 Then Ioshua went vp from Eglon, and all Israel with him vnto Hebron, and they fought against it. 
\v 37 And when they had taken it, they smote it with the edge of the sword, and the King thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the soules that were therein: he left none remaining, according to all as he had done to Eglon: for he destroyed it vtterly, and all the soules that were therein. 
\v 38 So Ioshua returned, and all Israel with him to Debir, and fought against it. 
\v 39 And when he had taken it, and the King thereof, and all the citie thereof, they smote them with the edge of the sword, and vtterly destroyed all the soules that were therein, he let none remaine: as he did to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the King thereof, as he had also done to Libnah, and to the King thereof. 
\v 40 So Ioshua smote all the hill countreys, and the South countreys, and the valleys, and the hill sides, and all their Kings, and let none remaine, but vtterly destroyed euery soule, as the Lord God of Israel had commanded. 
\v 41 And Ioshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea euen vnto Azzah, and all the countrey of Goshen, euen vnto Gibeon. 
\v 42 And all these Kings, and their land did Ioshua take at one time, because the Lord God of Israel fought for Israel. 
\v 43 Afterward, Ioshua and all Israel with him returned vnto the campe in Gilgal. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 And whe Iabin King of Hazor had heard this, then he sent to Iobab King of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph, 
\v 2 And vnto the Kings that were by ye North in the mountaines and plaines toward the Southside of Cinneroth, and in the valleys, and in the borders of Dor Westward, 
\v 3 And vnto the Canaanites, both by East, and by West, and vnto the Amorites, and Hittites, and Perizzites, and Iebusites in the mountaines, and vnto the Hiuites vnder Hermon in the land of Mizpeh. 
\v 4 And they came out and all their hostes with them, many people as the sande that is on the sea shore for multitude, with horses and charets exceeding many. 
\v 5 So all these Kings met together, and came and pitched together at the waters of Merom, for to fight against Israel. 
\v 6 Then the Lord sayd vnto Ioshua, Be not afrayd for them: for to morowe about this time will I deliuer them all slaine before Israel: thou shalt hough their horses, and burne their charets with fire. 
\v 7 Then came Ioshua and al the men of warre with him against them by the waters of Merom suddenly, and fell vpon them. 
\v 8 And the Lord gaue them into the hand of Israel: and they smote them, and chased them vnto great Zidon, and vnto Misrephothmaim, and vnto the valley of Mizpeh Eastward, and smote them vntill they had none remaining of them. 
\v 9 And Ioshua did vnto them as the Lord bade him: he houghed their horses, and burnt their charets with fire. 
\v 10 At that time also Ioshua turned backe, and tooke Hazor, and smote the King thereof with the sword: for Hazor before time was the head of all those kingdomes. 
\v 11 Moreouer, they smote all the persons that were therein with the edge of the sworde, vtterly destroying all, leauing none aliue, and hee burnt Hazor with fire. 
\v 12 So all ye cities of those Kings, and all the kings of them did Ioshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword, and vtterly destroyed them, as Moses the seruant of the Lord had commanded. 
\v 13 But Israel burnt none of the cities that stoode still in their strength, saue Hazor onely, that Ioshua burnt. 
\v 14 And all the spoyle of these cities and the cattel the children of Israel tooke for their praye, but they smote euery man with the edge of the sword vntill they had destroyed them, not leauing one aliue. 
\v 15 As the Lord had commanded Moses his seruant, so did Moses commande Ioshua, and so did Ioshua: he left nothing vndone of all that the Lord had commanded Moses. 
\v 16 So Ioshua tooke all this land of the mountaines, and all the South, and all the lande of Goshen, and the lowe countrey, and the plaine, and the mountaine of Israel, and the lowe countrey of the same, 
\v 17 From the mount Halak, that goeth vp to Seir, euen vnto Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon, vnder mount Hermon: and all their Kings he tooke, and smote them, and slewe them. 
\v 18 Ioshua made warre long time with all those Kings, 
\v 19 Neither was there any citie that made peace with the children of Israel, saue those Hiuites that inhabited Gibeon: all other they tooke by battell. 
\v 20 For it came of the Lord, to harden their heartes that they shoulde come against Israel in battell to the intent that they shoulde destroye them vtterly, and shewe them no mercie, but that they shoulde bring them to nought: as the Lord had commanded Moses. 
\v 21 And that same season came Ioshua, and destroyed the Anakims out of the mountaines: as out of Hebron, out of Debir, out of Anab, and out of all the mountaines of Iudah, and out of all the mountaines of Israel: Ioshua destroyed them vtterly with their cities. 
\v 22 There was no Anakim left in the lande of the children of Israel: onely in Azzah, in Gath, and in Ashdod were they left. 
\v 23 So Ioshua tooke the whole land, according to all that the Lord had saide vnto Moses: and Ioshua gaue it for an inheritance vnto Israel according to their portion through their tribes: then the land was at rest without warre. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 And these are the Kings of the land, which the children of Israel smote and possessed their land, on the other side Iorden toward the rising of the sunne, from the riuer Arnon, vnto mount Hermon, and all the plaine Eastward. 
\v 2 Sihon King of the Amorites, that dwelt in Heshbon, hauing dominion from Aroer, which is beside the riuer of Arnon, and from the middle of the riuer, and from halfe Gilead vnto the riuer Iabbok, in the border of the children of Ammon. 
\v 3 And from the plaine vnto the sea of Cinneroth Eastward, and vnto the Sea of the plaine, euen the salt sea Eastward, the way to Beth-ieshimoth, and from the South vnder the springs of Pisgah. 
\v 4 They conquered also the coast of Og King of Bashan of the remnant of the gyants, which dwelt at Ashtaroth, and at Edrei, 
\v 5 And reigned in mount Hermon, and in Salcah, and in all Bashan, vnto the border of the Geshurites, and the Maachathites, and halfe Gilead, euen the border of Sihon King of Heshbon. 
\v 6 Moses the seruant of the Lord, and the children of Israel smote them: Moses also the seruant of the Lord gaue their land for a possession vnto the Reubenites, and vnto the Gadites, and to halfe the tribe of Manasseh. 
\v 7 These also are the Kings of the countrey, which Ioshua and the children of Israel smote on this side Iorden, Westward, from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon, euen vnto the mount Halak that goeth vp to Seir, and Ioshua gaue it vnto the tribes of Israel for a possession, according to their portions: 
\v 8 In the mountaines, and in the valleys, and in the plaines, and in the hill sides, and in the wildernes, and in the South, where were the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hiuites, and the Iebusites. 
\v 9 The King of Iericho was one: the King of Ai, which is beside Beth-el, one: 
\v 10 The King of Ierusalem, one: the King of Hebron, one: 
\v 11 The King of Iarmuth, one: the King of Lachish, one: 
\v 12 The King of Eglon, one: the King of Gezer, one: 
\v 13 The King of Debir, one: the King of Geder, one: 
\v 14 The King of Hormah, one: the King of Arad, one: 
\v 15 The King of Libnah, one: the King of Adullam, one: 
\v 16 The King of Makkedah, one: the King of Beth-el, one: 
\v 17 The King of Tappuah, one: the King of Hepher, one: 
\v 18 The King of Aphek, one: the King of Lasharon, one: 
\v 19 The King of Madon, one: the King of Hazor, one: 
\v 20 The king of Shimron-meron, one: the King of Achshaph, one: 
\v 21 The King of Taanach, one: the King of Megiddo, one: 
\v 22 The King of Kedesh, one: the King of Iokneam of Carmel, one: 
\v 23 The King of Dor, in the countrey of Dor, one: the King of the nations of Gilgal, one: 
\v 24 The King of Tirzah, one. all the Kings were thirtie and one. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 Nowe when Ioshua was olde, and striken in yeeres, the Lord said vnto him, Thou art olde and growen in age, and there remaineth exceeding much land to be possessed: 
\v 2 This is the land that remaineth, all the regions of the Philistims, and all Geshuri, 
\v 3 From Nilus which is in Egypt, euen vnto the borders of Ekron Northward: this is counted of the Canaanites, euen fiue Lordships of the Philistims, the Azzithites, and the Ashdodites, the Eshkelonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites, and the Auites: 
\v 4 From the South, all the land of the Canaanites, and the caue that is beside the Sidonians, vnto Aphek, and to the borders of the Amorites: 
\v 5 And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunne rising from Bahal-gad vnder mount Hermon, vntil one come to Hamath. 
\v 6 All the inhabitants of the mountaines from Lebanon vnto Misrephothmaim, and all the Sidonians, I wil cast them out from before the children of Israel: only deuide thou it by lot vnto the Israelites, to inherite, as I haue commanded thee. 
\v 7 Nowe therefore deuide this lande to inherite, vnto the nine tribes, and to the halfe tribe of Manasseh. 
\v 8 For with halfe therof the Reubenites and the Gadites haue receiued their inheritance, which Moses gaue them beyond Iorden Eastward, euen as Moses the seruant of the Lord had giuen them, 
\v 9 From Aroer that is on the brinke of the riuer Arnon, and from the citie that is in the mids of the riuer, and all the plaine of Medeba vnto Dibon, 
\v 10 And all the cities of Sihon King of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, vnto the borders of the children of Ammon, 
\v 11 And Gilead, and the borders of the Geshurites and of the Maachathites, and all mount Hermon, with all Bashan vnto Salcah: 
\v 12 All the kingdome of Og in Bashan, which reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei: (who remained of the rest of the gyants) for these did Moses smite, and cast them out. 
\v 13 But the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites nor the Maachathites: but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among the Israelites euen vnto this day. 
\v 14 Onely vnto the tribe of Leui he gaue none inheritance, but the sacrifices of the Lord God of Israel are his inheritance, as he said vnto him. 
\v 15 Moses then gaue vnto the tribe of the children of Reuben inheritance, according to their families. 
\v 16 And their coast was from Aroer, that is on the brinke of the riuer Arnon, and from the citie that is in the middes of the riuer, and all the plaine which is by Medeba: 
\v 17 Heshbon with all the cities thereof, that are in the plaine: Dibon and Bamoth-baal, and Bethbaal-meon: 
\v 18 And Iahazah, and Kedemoth and Mephaath: 
\v 19 Kiriathaim also, and Sibmah, and Zerethshahar in the mount of Emek: 
\v 20 And Beth-peor, and Ashdoth-pisgah, and Beth-ieshimoth: 
\v 21 And all the cities of the plaine: and all the kingdome of Sihon King of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, whome Moses smote with the Princes of Midian, Eui, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, the dukes of Sihon, dwelling in the countrey. 
\v 22 And Balaam the sonne of Beor the soothsayer did the children of Israel slay with the sword, among them that were slaine. 
\v 23 And the border of the children of Reuben was Iorden with the coastes. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben according to their families, with the cities and their villages. 
\v 24 Also Moses gaue inheritance vnto ye tribe of Gad, euen vnto the children of Gad according to their families. 
\v 25 And their coastes were Iazer, and all the cities of Gilead and halfe the lande of the children of Ammon vnto Aroer, which is before Rabbah: 
\v 26 And from Heshbon vnto Ramoth, Mizpeh, and Betonim: and from Mahanaim vnto the borders of Debir: 
\v 27 And in the valley Beth-aram, and Bethnimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdome of Sihon King of Heshbon, vnto Iorden and the borders euen vnto the Sea coast of Cinneereth, beyond Iorden Eastward. 
\v 28 This is the inheritance of the children of Gad, after their families, with the cities, and their villages. 
\v 29 Also Moses gaue inheritance vnto the halfe tribe of Manasseh: and this belonged to the halfe tribe of the children of Manasseh according to their families. 
\v 30 And their border was from Mahanaim, euen all Bashan, to wit, all the kingdome of Og King of Bashan, and all the townes of Iair which are in Bashan, threescore cities, 
\v 31 And halfe Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were giuen vnto the children of Machir the sonne of Manasseh, to halfe of the children of Machir after their families. 
\v 32 These are the heritages, which Moses did distribute in the plaine of Moab beyond Iorden, toward Iericho Eastward. 
\v 33 But vnto the tribe of Leui Moses gaue none inheritance: for the Lord God of Israel is their inheritance, as he said vnto them. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1 These also are the places which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the Priest, and Ioshua the sonne of Nun and the chiefe fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed to them, 
\v 2 By the lot of their inheritance, as the Lord had commanded by the hande of Moses, to giue to the nine tribes, and the halfe tribe. 
\v 3 For Moses had giuen inheritance vnto two tribes and an halfe tribe, beyond Iorde: but vnto the Leuites he gaue none inheritance among them. 
\v 4 For the childre of Ioseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: therefore they gaue no part vnto the Leuites in the lande, saue cities to dwell in, with the suburbes of the same for their beastes and their substance. 
\v 5 As the Lord had commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did when they deuided the land. 
\v 6 Then the children of Iudah came vnto Ioshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the sonne of Iephunneh the Kenezite saide vnto him, Thou knowest what the Lord saide vnto Moses the man of God, concerning me and thee in Kadesh-barnea. 
\v 7 Fourtie yeere olde was I, when Moses the seruant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh-barnea to espie the land, and I brought him word againe, as I thought in mine heart. 
\v 8 But my brethren that went vp with me, discouraged the heart of the people: yet I followed still the Lord my God. 
\v 9 Wherefore Moses sware the same day, saying, Certainely the land whereon thy feete haue troden, shalbe thine inheritance, and thy childrens for euer, because thou hast followed constantly the Lord my God. 
\v 10 Therefore beholde nowe, the Lord hath kept me aliue, as he promised: this is the fourtie and fift yeere since the Lord spake this thing vnto Moses, while the children of Israel wandered in the wildernes: and nowe loe, I am this day foure score and fiue yeere olde: 
\v 11 And yet am as strong at this time, as I was when Moses sent me: as strong as I was then, so strong am I nowe, either for warre, or for gouernment. 
\v 12 Nowe therefore giue me this mountaine whereof ye Lord spake in that day (for thou heardest in that day, how the Anakims were there, and the cities great and walled) if so be the Lord will be with me, that I may driue them out, as the Lord said. 
\v 13 Then Ioshua blessed him, and gaue vnto Caleb the sonne of Iephunneh, Hebron for an inheritance. 
\v 14 Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the sonne of Iephunneh the Kenezite, vnto this day: because he followed constantly the Lord God of Israel. 
\v 15 And the name of Hebron was before time, Kiriath-arba: which Arba was a great man amog the Anakims: thus the land ceassed from warre. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1 This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Iudah by their families: euen to the border of Edom and the wildernesse of Zin, Southward on the Southcoast. 
\v 2 And their South border was the salt Sea coast, from the point that looketh Southward. 
\v 3 And it went out on the Southside towarde Maaleth-akrabbim, and went along to Zin, and ascended vp on the Southside vnto Kadesh-barnea, and went along to Hezron, and went vp to Adar, and fet a compasse to Karkaa. 
\v 4 From thence went it along to Azmon, and reached vnto the riuer of Egypt, and the end of that coast was on the Westside: this shall be your South coast. 
\v 5 Also the Eastborder shalbe the salt Sea, vnto the end of Iorden: and the border on the North quarter from the point of the Sea, and from the end of Iorden. 
\v 6 And this border goeth vp to Beth-hogla, and goeth along by ye Northside of Beth-arabah: so the border from thence goeth vp to the stone of Bohan the sonne of Reuben. 
\v 7 Againe this border goeth vp to Debir from the valley of Achor, and Northwarde, turning toward Gilgal, that lyeth before the going vp to Adummim, which is on the Southside of the riuer: also this border goeth vp to the waters of En-shemesh, and endeth at En-rogel. 
\v 8 Then this border goeth vp to the valley of the sonne of Hinnom; on the Southside of the Iebusites: the same is Ierusalem. also this border goeth vp to the top of the mountaine that lyeth before the valley of Hinnom Westward, which is by the end of the valley of ye gyants Northward. 
\v 9 So this border compasseth from the top of the mountaine vnto the fountaine of the water of Nephtoah, and goeth out to the cities of mount Ephron: and this border draweth to Baalah, which is Kiriath-iearim. 
\v 10 Then this border compasseth from Baalah Westward vnto mount Seir, and goeth along vnto the side of mount Iearim, which is Chesalon on the Northside: so it commeth downe to Bethshemesh, and goeth to Timnah. 
\v 11 Also this border goeth out vnto the side of Ekron Northwarde: and this border draweth to Shicron, and goeth along to mount Baalah, and stretcheth vnto Iabneel: and the endes of this coast are to the Sea. 
\v 12 And the Westborder is to the great Sea: so this border shalbe the bounds of the children of Iudah round about, according to their families. 
\v 13 And vnto Caleb the sonne of Iephunneh did Ioshua giue a part among the children of Iudah, as the Lord commanded him, euen Kiriath-arba of the father of Anak, which is Hebron. 
\v 14 And Caleb droue thence three sonnes of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the sonnes of Anak. 
\v 15 And he went vp thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before time was Kiriath-sepher. 
\v 16 Then Caleb sayd, He that smiteth Kiriath-sepher, and taketh it, euen to him wil I giue Achsah my daughter to wife. 
\v 17 And Othniel, the sonne of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb tooke it: and he gaue him Achsah his daughter to wife. 
\v 18 And as she went in to him, she moued him, to aske of her father a fielde: and she lighted off her asse, and Caleb sayd vnto her, What wilt thou? 
\v 19 Then she answered, Giue me a blessing: for thou hast giuen mee the South countrey: giue me also springs of water. And hee gaue her the springs aboue and the springs beneath. 
\v 20 This shalbe the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Iudah according to their families. 
\v 21 And the vtmost cities of the tribe of the children of Iudah, toward the coastes of Edom Southward were Kabzeel, and Eder, and Iagur, 
\v 22 And Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah, 
\v 23 And Kedesh, and Hazor, and Ithnan, 
\v 24 Ziph, and Telem, and Bealoth, 
\v 25 And Hazor, Hadattah, and Kerioth, Hesron (which is Hazor) 
\v 26 Amam, and Shema, and Moladah, 
\v 27 And Hazar, Gaddah, and Heshmon, and Beth-palet, 
\v 28 And Hasar-shual, and Beersheba, and Biziothiah, 
\v 29 Baalah, and Iim, and Azem, 
\v 30 And Eltolad, and Chesil, and Hormah, 
\v 31 And Ziklag, and Madmanna, and Sansannah, 
\v 32 And Lebaoth, and Shilhim, and Ain, and Rimmon: all these cities are twentie and nine with their villages. 
\v 33 In the lowe countrey were Eshtaol, and Zoreah, and Ashnah, 
\v 34 And Zanoah, and En-gannim, Tappuah, and Enam, 
\v 35 Iarmuth, and Adullam, Socoh, and Azekah, 
\v 36 And Sharaim, and Adithaim, and Gederah, and Gederothaim: fourteene cities with their villages. 
\v 37 Zenam, and Hadashah, and Migdal-gad, 
\v 38 And Dileam, and Mizpeh, and Ioktheel, 
\v 39 Lachish, and Bozkath, and Eglon, 
\v 40 And Cabbon, and Lahmam, and Kithlish, 
\v 41 And Gederoth, Beth-dagon, and Naamah, and Makkedah: sixteene cities with their villages. 
\v 42 Lebnah, and Ether, and Ashan, 
\v 43 And Iipthtah, and Ashnah, and Nezib, 
\v 44 And Keilah, and Aczib, and Mareshah: nine cities with their villages. 
\v 45 Ekron with her townes and her villages, 
\v 46 From Ekron, euen vnto the Sea, all that lyeth about Ashdod with their villages. 
\v 47 Ashdod with her townes and her villages: Azzah with her townes and her villages, vnto the riuer of Egypt, and the great Sea was their coast. 
\v 48 And in the mountaines were Shamir, and Iattir, and Socoh, 
\v 49 And Dannah, and Kiriath-sannath (which is Debir) 
\v 50 And Anab, and Ashtemoth, and Anim, 
\v 51 And Goshen, and Holon, and Giloh: eleuen cities with their villages, 
\v 52 Arab, and Dumah, and Eshean, 
\v 53 And Ianum, and Beth-tappuah, and Aphekah, 
\v 54 And Humtah, and Kiriath-arba, (which is Hebron) and Zior: nine cities with their villages. 
\v 55 Maon, Carmel, and Ziph, and Iuttah, 
\v 56 And Izreel, and Iokdeam, and Zanoah, 
\v 57 Kain, Gibeah, and Timnah: ten cities with their villages. 
\v 58 Halhul, Beth-zur, and Gedor, 
\v 59 And Maarah, and Beth-anoth, and Eltekon: sixe cities with their villages. 
\v 60 Kiriath-baal, which is Kiriath-iearim, and Rabbah: two cities with their villages. 
\v 61 In the wildernes were Beth-arabah, Middin, and Secacah, 
\v 62 And Nibshan, and the citie of salt, and Engedi: sixe cities with their villages. 
\v 63 Neuerthelesse, the Iebusites that were the inhabitants of Ierusalem, could not the children of Iudah cast out, but the Iebusites dwell with the children of Iudah at Ierusalem vnto this day. 
\c 16  
\p
\v 1 And the lot fell to the children of Ioseph from Iorden by Iericho vnto the water of Iericho Eastward, and to the wildernes that goeth vp from Iericho by the mount Beth-el: 
\v 2 And goeth out from Beth-el to Luz, and runneth along vnto the borders of Archiataroth, 
\v 3 And goeth down Westward to the coast of Iaphleti, vnto the coast of Beth-horon the nether, and to Gezer: and the endes thereof are at the Sea. 
\v 4 So the children of Ioseph, Manasseh and Ephraim tooke their inheritance. 
\v 5 Also the borders of the children of Ephraim according to their families, euen the borders of their inheritance on the Eastside were Atroth-addar, vnto Beth-horon the vpper. 
\v 6 And this border goeth out to the Sea vnto Michmethah on the Northside, and this border returneth Eastward vnto Taanathshiloh, and passeth it on the Eastside vnto Ianohah, 
\v 7 And goeth downe from Ianohah to Ataroth, and Naarath, and commeth to Iericho, and goeth out at Iorden. 
\v 8 And this border goeth from Tappuah Westward vnto the riuer Kanah, and the endes thereof are at the Sea: this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their families. 
\v 9 And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among the inheritance of the children of Manasseh: all the cities with their villages. 
\v 10 And they cast not out the Canaanite that dwelt in Gezer, but the Canaanite dwelt among the Ephraimites vnto this day, and serued vnder tribute. 
\c 17  
\p
\v 1 This was also the lot of the tribe of Manasseh: for he was the first borne of Ioseph, to wit, of Machir the first borne of Manasseh, and the father of Gilead: nowe because he was a man of warre, he had Gilead and Bashan. 
\v 2 And also of the rest of the sonnes of Manasseh by their families, euen of the sonnes of Abiezer, and of the sonnes of Helek, and of ye sonnes of Azriel, and of the sonnes of Shechem, and of the sonnes of Hepher, and of the sonnes of Shemida: these were the males of Manasseh, the sonne of Ioseph according to their families. 
\v 3 But Zelophehad the sonne of Hephir, the sonne of Gilead, the sonne of Machir, ye sonne of Manasseh, had no sonnes, but daughters: and these are the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah and Tirzah: 
\v 4 Which came before Eleazar the Priest, and before Ioshua the sonne of Nun, and before the princes, saying, The Lord commanded Moses to giue vs an inheritance among our brethren: therefore according to the commandement of the Lord he gaue them an inheritance among the brethren of their father. 
\v 5 And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is on the other side Iorden, 
\v 6 Because the daughters of Manasseh did inherite among his sonnes: and Manassehs other sonnes had the land of Gilead. 
\v 7 So the borders of Manasseh were from Asher to Michmethah that lieth before Shechem, and this border goeth on the right hand, euen vnto the inhabitants of En-tappuah. 
\v 8 The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh, but Tappuah beside the border of Manasseh belongeth to the sonnes of Ephraim. 
\v 9 Also this border goeth downe vnto the riuer Kanah Southward to the riuer: these cities of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh: and the border of Manasseh is on the Northside of the riuer, and the endes of it are at the Sea, 
\v 10 The South perteyneth to Ephraim, and the North to Manasseh, and the Sea is his border: and they met together in Asher Northwarde, and in Issachar Eastward. 
\v 11 And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher, Beth-shean, and her townes, and Ibleam, and her townes, and the inhabitants of Dor with ye townes thereof, and the inhabitants of En-dor with the townes thereof, and the inhabitants of Thaanach with her townes, and the inhabitants of Megiddo with the townes of the same, euen three countreis. 
\v 12 Yet the children of Manasseh coulde not destroy those cities, but the Canaanites dwelled still in that land. 
\v 13 Neuerthelesse, when the children of Israel were strong, they put the Canaanites vnder tribute, but cast them not out wholy. 
\v 14 Then the children of Ioseph spake vnto Ioshua, saying, Why hast thou giuen me but one lot, and one portion to inherite, seeing I am a great people, for as much as the Lord hath blessed me hitherto? 
\v 15 Ioshua then answered them, If thou be much people, get thee vp to the wood, and cut trees for thy selfe there in the lande of the Perizzites, and of the gyants, if mount Ephraim be too narowe for thee. 
\v 16 Then the children of Ioseph saide, The mountaine will not be ynough for vs: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the lowe countrey haue charets of yron, aswell they in Beth-shean, and in the townes of the same, as they in the valley of Izreel. 
\v 17 And Ioshua spake vnto the house of Ioseph, to Ephraim, and to Manasseh, saying, Thou art a great people, and hast great power, and shalt not haue one lot. 
\v 18 Therefore the mountaine shall be thine: for it is a wood, and thou shalt cut it downe: and the endes of it shall be thine, and thou shalt cast out the Canaanites, though they haue yron charets, and though they be strong. 
\c 18  
\p
\v 1 And the whole Congregation of the children of Israel, came together at Shiloh: for they set vp the Tabernacle of the Congregation there, after the land was subiect vnto them. 
\v 2 Nowe there remained among the children of Israel seuen tribes, to whom they had not deuided their inheritance. 
\v 3 Therefore Ioshua said vnto the children of Israel, Howe long are ye so slacke to enter and possesse the land which the Lord God of your fathers hath giuen you? 
\v 4 Giue from among you for euery tribe three men, that I may sende them, and that they may rise, and walke through the land, and distribute it according to their inheritance, and returne to me. 
\v 5 And that they may deuide it vnto them into seuen parts, (Iudah shall abide in his coast at the South, and the house of Ioseph shall stand in their coastes at the North) 
\v 6 Ye shall describe the land therefore into seuen partes, and shall bring them hither to me, and I will cast lottes for you here before the Lord our God. 
\v 7 But the Leuites shall haue no part among you: for the Priesthood of the Lord is their inheritance: also Gad and Reuben and halfe the tribe of Manasseh haue receiued their inheritance beyond Iorden Eastward, which Moses the seruant of the Lord gaue them. 
\v 8 Then the men arose, and went their way: and Ioshua charged them that went to describe the land, saying, Depart, and goe through the land, and describe it, and returne to me, that I may here cast lottes for you before the Lord in Shiloh. 
\v 9 So the men departed, and passed through the lande, and described it by cities into seuen partes in a booke, and returned to Ioshua into the campe at Shiloh. 
\v 10 Then Ioshua cast lottes for them in Shiloh before the Lord, and there Ioshua deuided the land vnto the children of Israel, according to their portions: 
\v 11 And the lot of the tribe of the children of Beniamin came foorth according to their families, and the cost of their lot lay betweene the children of Iudah, and the children of Ioseph. 
\v 12 And their coast on the Northside was from Iorden, and the border went vp to the side of Iericho on the Northpart, and went vp through the mountaines Westward, and the endes thereof are in the wildernesse of Beth-auen: 
\v 13 And this border goeth along from thence to Luz, euen to the Southside of Luz (the same is Beth-el) and this border descendeth to Atroth-addar, neere the mount, that lyeth on the Southside of Beth-horon the nether. 
\v 14 So the border turneth, and compasseth the corner of the Sea Southward, from the mount that lyeth before Beth-horon Southward: and the endes thereof are at Kiriath-baal (which is Kiriath-iearim) a citie of the children of Iudah: this is the Westquarter. 
\v 15 And the Southquarter is from the ende of Kiriath-iearim, and this border goeth out Westward, and commeth to the fountaine of waters of Nephtoah. 
\v 16 And this border descendeth at the ende of the mountaine, that lyeth before the valley of Ben-hinnom, which is in the valley of the gyants Northward, and descendeth into the valley of Hinnom by the side of Iebusi Southwarde, and goeth downe to En-rogel, 
\v 17 And compasseth from the North, and goeth foorth to En-shemesh, and stretcheth to Geliloth, which is toward the going vp vnto Adummim, and goeth downe to the stone of Bohan the sonne of Reuben. 
\v 18 So it goeth along to the side ouer against the plaine Northward, and goeth downe into the plaine. 
\v 19 After, this border goeth along to the side of Beth-hoglah Northward: and the endes thereof, that is, of the border, reach to the point of the salt Sea Northward, and to the ende of Iorden Southward: this is the Southcoast. 
\v 20 Also Iorden is the border of it on the Eastside: this is the inheritance of the children of Beniamin by the coastes thereof rounde about according to their families. 
\v 21 Nowe the cities of the tribe of the children of Beniamin according to their families, are Iericho, and Beth-hoglah, and the valley of Keziz, 
\v 22 And Beth-arabah, and Zemaraim, and Beth-el, 
\v 23 And Auim, and Parah, and Ophrah, 
\v 24 And Chephar, Ammonai, and Ophni, and Gaba: twelue cities with their villages. 
\v 25 Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth, 
\v 26 And Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah, 
\v 27 And Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah, 
\v 28 And Zela, Eleph, and Iebusi, (which is Ierusalem) Gibeath, and Kiriath: fourteene cities with their villages: this is the inheritance of the children of Beniamin according to their families. 
\c 19  
\p
\v 1 And the second lot came out to Simeon, euen for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families: and their inheritance was in the middes of the inheritance of the children of Iudah. 
\v 2 Nowe they had in their inheritance, Beersheba, and Sheba, and Moladah, 
\v 3 And Hazur-shual, and Balah, and Azem, 
\v 4 And Eltolad, and Bethul, and Hormah, 
\v 5 And Ziklag, and Beth-marcaboth, and Hazar-susah, 
\v 6 And Beth-lebaoth, and Sharuhen: thirteene cities with their villages. 
\v 7 Ain, Remmon, and Ether, and Ashan: foure cities with their villages. 
\v 8 And all the villages that were round about these cities, vnto Baalathbeer, and Ramath Southward: this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families. 
\v 9 Out of the portion of the children of Iudah came ye inheritance of the childre of Simeon: for the part of ye children of Iudah was too much for them: therefore the children of Simeon had their inheritance within their inheritance. 
\v 10 Also the third lot arose for the children of Zebulun according to their families: and the coastes of their inheritance came to Sarid, 
\v 11 And their border goeth vp Westwarde, euen to Maralah, and reacheth to Dabbasheth, and meeteth with the riuer that lyeth before Iokneam, 
\v 12 And turneth from Sarid Eastward towarde the sunne rising vnto the border of Chisloth-tabor, and goeth out to Daberath, and ascendeth to Iaphia, 
\v 13 And from thence goeth along Eastwarde towarde the sunne rising to Gittah-hepher to Ittah-kazin, and goeth foorth to Rimmon, and turneth to Neah. 
\v 14 And this border compasseth it on ye North side to Hannathon, and the endes thereof are in the valley of Iiphtah-el, 
\v 15 And Kattath, and Nahallal, and Shimron, and Idalah, and Beth-lehem: twelue cities with their villages. 
\v 16 This is the inheritance of the children of Zebulun according to their families: that is, these cities and their villages. 
\v 17 The fourth lot came out to Issachar, euen for the children of Issachar according to their families. 
\v 18 And their coast was Izreelah, and Chesulloth, and Shunem, 
\v 19 And Hapharaim, and Shion, and Anaharath, 
\v 20 And Harabbith, and Kishion, and Abez, 
\v 21 And Remeth, and En-gannim, and Enhaddah, and Beth-pazzez. 
\v 22 And this coast reacheth to Tabor, and Shahazimath, and Beth-shemesh, and the endes of their coast reach to Iorden: sixteene cities with their villages. 
\v 23 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Issachar according to their families: that is, the cities, and their villages. 
\v 24 Also the fift lot came out for the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families. 
\v 25 And their coast was Helcath, and Hali, and Beten, and Achshaph, 
\v 26 And Alammelech, and Amad, and Misheal, and came to Carmel Westward, and to Shihor Libnath, 
\v 27 And turneth towarde the sunne rising to Beth-dagon, and commeth to Zebulun, and to the valley of Iiphtah-el, toward the Northside of Beth-emek, and Neiel, and goeth out on the left side of Cabul, 
\v 28 And to Ebron, and Rehob, and Hammon, and Kanah, vnto great Zidon. 
\v 29 Then the coast turneth to Ramah and to the strong citie of Zor, and this border turneth to Hosah, and the ends thereof are at the Sea from Hebel to Achzib, 
\v 30 Vmmah also and Aphek, and Rehob: two and twentie cities with their villages. 
\v 31 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families: that is, these cities and their villages. 
\v 32 The sixt lot came out to the children of Naphtali, euen to the children of Naphtali according to their families. 
\v 33 And their coast was from Heleph, and from Allon in Zaanannim, and Adaminekeb, and Iabneel, euen to Lakum, and the ends thereof are at Iorden. 
\v 34 So this coast turneth Westwarde to Aznoth-tabor, and goeth out from thence to Hukkok, and reacheth to Zebulun on the Southside, and goeth to Asher on the Westside, and to Iudah by Iorden toward the sunne rising. 
\v 35 And the strong cities are Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath, and Cinneereth, 
\v 36 And Adamah, and Ramah, and Hazor, 
\v 37 And Kedesh, and Edrei, and En-hazor, 
\v 38 And Iron, and Migdal-el, Horem, and Beth-anah, and Beth-shemesh: nineteene cities with their villages. 
\v 39 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali according to their families: that is, the cities and their villages. 
\v 40 The seuenth lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families. 
\v 41 And the coast of their inheritance was Zorah, and Eshtaol, and Ir-shemesh, 
\v 42 And Shaalabbin, and Aiialon, and Ithlah, 
\v 43 And Elon, and Temnathah, and Ekron, 
\v 44 And Eltekeh, and Gibbethon, and Baalah, 
\v 45 And Iehud, and Bene-berak, and Gath-rimmon, 
\v 46 And Me-iarkon, and Rakkon, with the border that lieth before Iapho. 
\v 47 But the coastes of the children of Dan fell out too litle for them: therefore the children of Dan went vp to fight against Leshem, and tooke it, and smote it with the edge of the sworde, and possessed it, and dwelt therein, and called Leshem, Dan after the name of Dan their father. 
\v 48 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the childre of Dan according to their families: that is, these cities and their villages. 
\v 49 When they had made an ende of deuiding the lande by the coastes thereof, then the children of Israel gaue an inheritance vnto Ioshua the sonne of Nun among them. 
\v 50 According to the worde of the Lord they gaue him the citie which hee asked, euen Timnath-serah in mount Ephraim: and hee built the citie and dwelt therein. 
\v 51 These are ye heritages which Eleazar the Priest, and Ioshua the sonne of Nun, and the chiefe fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel deuided by lot in Shiloh before the Lord at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation: so they made an ende of deuiding the countrey. 
\c 20  
\p
\v 1 The Lord also spake vnto Ioshua, saying, 
\v 2 Speake to the children of Israel, and say, Appoint you cities of refuge, whereof I spake vnto you by the hand of Moses, 
\v 3 That the slaier that killeth any person by ignorance, and vnwittingly, may flee thither, and they shall be your refuge from the auenger of blood. 
\v 4 And he that doeth flee vnto one of those cities, shall stand at the entring of the gate of the citie, and shall shewe his cause to the Elders of the citie: and they shall receiue him into the citie vnto them, and giue him a place, that hee may dwell with them. 
\v 5 And if the auenger of blood pursue after him, they shall not deliuer the slaier into his hand because hee smote his neighbour ignorantly, neither hated he him before time: 
\v 6 But hee shall dwell in that citie vntill hee stande before the Congregation in iudgement, or vntill the death of the hie Priest that shall be in those daies: then shall the slaier returne, and come vnto his owne citie, and vnto his owne house, euen vnto the citie from whence he fled. 
\v 7 Then they appointed Kedesh in Galil in mount Naphtali, and Shechem in mount Ephraim, and Kiriath-arba, (which is Hebron) in the mountaine of Iudah. 
\v 8 And on the other side Iorden toward Iericho Eastward, they appoynted Bezer in the wildernesse vpon the plaine, out of the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead, out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan, out of the tribe of Manasseh. 
\v 9 These were the cities appoynted for all the children of Israel, and for the stranger that soiourned among them, that whosoeuer killed any person ignorantly, might flee thither, and not die by the hande of the auenger of blood, vntill hee stoode before the Congregation. 
\c 21  
\p
\v 1 Then came the principall fathers of the Leuites vnto Eleazar the Priest, and vnto Ioshua the sonne of Nun, and vnto the chiefe fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, 
\v 2 And spake vnto them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, The Lord commanded by the hande of Moses, to giue vs cities to dwell in, with the suburbes thereof for our cattell. 
\v 3 So the children of Israel gaue vnto the Leuites, out of their inheritance at the commandement of the Lord these cities with their suburbes. 
\v 4 And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites: and the children of Aaron ye Priest, which were of the Leuites, had by lot, out of the tribe of Iudah, and out of the tribe of Simeon, and out of the tribe of Beniamin thirteene cities. 
\v 5 And the rest of the children of Kohath had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan, and out of the halfe tribe of Manasseh, tenne cities. 
\v 6 Also the children of Gershon had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Issachar, and out of the tribe of Asher, and out of ye tribe of Naphtali, and out of the halfe tribe of Manasseh in Bashan, thirteene cities. 
\v 7 The children of Merari according to their families had out of the tribe of Reuben, and out of the tribe of Gad, and out of the tribe of Zebulun, twelue cities. 
\v 8 So the children of Israel gaue by lot vnto the Leuites these cities with their suburbes, as the Lord had commanded by the hand of Moses. 
\v 9 And they gaue out of the tribe of the children of Iudah, and out of the tribe of the children of Simeo, these cities which are here named. 
\v 10 And they were the childrens of Aaron being of the families of the Kohathites, and of the sonnes of Leui, (for theirs was the first lot) 
\v 11 So they gaue them Kiriath-arba of the father of Anok (which is Hebron) in the mountaine of Iudah, with the suburbes of the same round about it. 
\v 12 (But the lande of the citie, and the villages thereof, gaue they to Caleb the sonne of Iephunneh to be his possession) 
\v 13 Thus they gaue to the children of Aaron the Priest, a citie of refuge for the slaier, euen Hebron with her suburbes, and Libnah with her suburbes, 
\v 14 And Iattir with her suburbes, and Eshtemoa, and her suburbes, 
\v 15 And Holon with her suburbes, and Debir with her suburbes, 
\v 16 And Ain with her suburbes, and Iuttah with her suburbes, Beth-shemesh with her suburbes: nine cities out of those two tribes. 
\v 17 And out of the tribe of Beniamin they gaue Gibeon with her suburbes, Geba with her suburbes, 
\v 18 Anathoth with her suburbes, and Almon with her suburbes: foure cities. 
\v 19 All the cities of the children of Aaron Priests, were thirteene cities with their suburbes. 
\v 20 But to the families of the children of Kohath of the Leuites, which were the rest of the children of Kohath (for the cities of their lot were out of the tribe of Ephraim) 
\v 21 They gaue them the citie of refuge for the slaier, Shechem with her suburbes in mount Ephraim, and Gezer with her suburbes, 
\v 22 And Kibzaim with her suburbs, and Bethhoron with her suburbes: foure cities. 
\v 23 And out of the tribe of Dan, Eltekeh with her suburbes, Gibethon with her suburbes, 
\v 24 Aiialon with her suburbes, Gath-rimmon with her suburbes: foure cities. 
\v 25 And out of the halfe tribe of Manasseh, Tanach with her suburbes, and Gath-rimmon with her suburbes: two cities. 
\v 26 All the cities for the other families of the children of Kohath were ten with their suburbes. 
\v 27 Also vnto the children of Gershon of the families of the Leuites, they gaue out of the halfe tribe of Manasseh, the citie of refuge for the slaier, Golan in Bashan with her suburbes, and Beeshterah with her suburbes: two cities. 
\v 28 And out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishon with her suburbes, Dabereh with her suburbes, 
\v 29 Iarmuth with her suburbes, En-gannim with her suburbes: foure cities. 
\v 30 And out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with her suburbes, Abdon with her suburbes, 
\v 31 Helkah with her suburbs, and Rehob with her suburbes: foure cities. 
\v 32 And out of the tribe of Naphtali, the citie of refuge for the slaier, Kedesh in Galil with her suburbes, and Hammoth-dor with her suburbes, and Kartan with her suburbes: three cities. 
\v 33 Al the cities of the Gershonites according to their families, were thirteene cities with their suburbes. 
\v 34 Also vnto the families of the children of Merari the rest of the Leuites, they gaue out of the tribe of Zebulun, Iokneam with her suburbs, and Kartah with her suburbes, 
\v 35 Dimnah with her suburbes, Nahalal, with her suburbes: foure cities. 
\v 36 And out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with her suburbs, and Iahazah with her suburbs, 
\v 37 Kedemoth with her suburbes, and Mephaath with her suburbes: foure cities. 
\v 38 And out of the tribe of Gad they gaue for a citie of refuge for the slaier, Ramoth in Gilead with her suburbes, and Mahanaim with her suburbes, 
\v 39 Heshbon with her suburbs, and Iazer with her suburbes: foure cities in all. 
\v 40 So all the cities of the children of Merari according to their families (which were the rest of the families of the Leuites) were by their lot, twelue cities. 
\v 41 And all the cities of the Leuites within the possession of the children of Israel, were eight and fourtie with their suburbes. 
\v 42 These cities lay euery one seuerallie with their suburbes round about them: so were all these cities. 
\v 43 So the Lord gaue vnto Israel all ye land, which hee had sworne to giue vnto their fathers: and they possessed it, and dwelt therein. 
\v 44 Also the Lord gaue them rest rounde about according to all that hee had sworne vnto their fathers: and there stoode not a man of all their enemies before them: for the Lord deliuered all their enemies into their hand. 
\v 45 There failed nothing of all the good things, which the Lord hath sayde vnto the house of Israel, but all came to passe. 
\c 22  
\p
\v 1 Then Ioshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the halfe tribe of Manasseh, 
\v 2 And sayd vnto them, Ye haue kept all that Moses the seruaunt of the Lord commanded you, and haue obeied my voice in all that I commanded you: 
\v 3 You haue not forsaken your brethren this long season vnto this day, but haue diligently kept the commandement of the Lord your God. 
\v 4 And nowe the Lord hath giuen rest vnto your brethren as he promised them: therefore nowe returne ye and goe to your tentes, to the land of your possession, which Moses the seruant of the Lord hath giuen you beyond Iorden. 
\v 5 But take diligent heede, to doe the commandement and Lawe, which Moses the seruant of the Lord commanded you: that is, that ye loue the Lord your God, and walke in all his wayes, and keepe his commandements, and cleaue vnto him, and serue him with all your heart and with all your soule. 
\v 6 So Ioshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went vnto their tents. 
\v 7 Nowe vnto one halfe of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had giuen a possession in Bashan: and vnto the other halfe thereof gaue Ioshua among their brethren on this side Iorden Westwarde: therefore when Ioshua sent them away vnto their tents, and blessed them, 
\v 8 Thus he spake vnto them, saying, Returne with much riches vnto your tents, and with a great multitude of cattell, with siluer and with golde, with brasse and with yron, and with great abundance of rayment: deuide the spoyle of your enemies with your brethren. 
\v 9 So the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and halfe the tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel from Shiloh (which is in the land of Canaan) to goe vnto the countrey of Gilead to the land of their possession, which they had obteyned, according to ye word of the Lord by the hand of Moses. 
\v 10 And when they came vnto the borders of Iorden (which are in the land of Canaan) then the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the halfe tribe of Manasseh, built there an altar by Iorden, a great altar to see to. 
\v 11 When the children of Israel heard say, Beholde, the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the halfe tribe of Manasseh haue built an altar in the forefront of the lande of Canaan vpon the borders of Iorden at the passage of the children of Israel: 
\v 12 When the children of Israel heard it, then the whole Congregation of the children of Israel gathered them together at Shiloh to goe vp to warre against them. 
\v 13 Then the children of Israel sent vnto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to ye halfe tribe of Manasseh into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the sonne of Eleazar the Priest, 
\v 14 And with him ten princes, of euery chiefe house a prince, according to all the tribes of Israel: for euery one was chiefe of their fathers housholde among the thousands of Israel. 
\v 15 So they went vnto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the halfe tribe of Manasseh, vnto the land of Gilead, and spake with them, saying, 
\v 16 Thus saith the whole congregation of the Lord, What transgression is this that ye haue transgressed against the God of Israel, to turne away this day from the Lord, in that ye haue built you an altar for to rebell this day against the Lord? 
\v 17 Haue we too litle for the wickednesse of Peor, whereof we are not clensed vnto this day, though a plague came vpon the Congregation of the Lord? 
\v 18 Ye also are turned away this day from the Lord: and seeing ye rebell to day against ye Lord, euen to morowe he will be wroth with all the Congregation of Israel. 
\v 19 Notwithstanding if the land of your possession be vncleane, come ye ouer vnto the land of the possession of the Lord, wherein the Lordes Tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession among vs: but rebell not against the Lord, nor rebell not against vs in building you an altar, beside the altar of the Lord our God. 
\v 20 Did not Achan ye sonne of Zerah trespasse grieuously in the execrable thing, and wrath fell on all the Congregation of Israel? and this man alone perished not in his wickednesse. 
\v 21 Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad, and halfe the tribe of Manasseh answered, and saide vnto the heads ouer the thousands of Israel, 
\v 22 The Lord God of gods, the Lord God of gods, he knoweth, and Israel himselfe shall know: if by rebellion, or by transgression against ye Lord we haue done it, saue thou vs not this day. 
\v 23 If we haue built vs an altar to returne away from the Lord, either to offer thereon burnt offering, or meate offering, or to offer peace offerings thereon, let the Lord himselfe require it: 
\v 24 And if we haue not rather done it for feare of this thing, saying, In time to come your children might say vnto our children, What haue ye to doe with the Lord God of Israel? 
\v 25 For the Lord hath made Iorden a border betweene vs and you, ye children of Reuben, and of Gad: therefore ye haue no part in the Lord: so shall your children make our children cease from fearing the Lord. 
\v 26 Therefore we said, We will nowe go about to make vs an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice, 
\v 27 But it shall be a witnesse betweene vs and you, and betweene our generations after vs, to execute the seruice of the Lord before him in our burnt offerings, and in our sacrifices, and in our peace offerings, and that your children should not say to our children in time to come, Ye haue no part in the Lord. 
\v 28 Therefore said we, If so be that they should so say to vs or to our generations in time to come, then will we answere, Beholde the facion of the altar of the Lord, which our fathers made, not for burnt offering nor for sacrifice, but it is a witnesse betweene vs and you. 
\v 29 God forbid, that we should rebell against the Lord, and turne this day away from the Lord to builde an altar for burnt offering, or for meate offering, or for sacrifice, saue the altar of the Lord our God, that is before his Tabernacle. 
\v 30 And when Phinehas the Priest, and the princes of the Congregation and heads ouer the thousands of Israel which were with him, heard the wordes, that the children of Reuben, and children of Gad, and the children of Manasseh spake, they were well content. 
\v 31 And Phinehas the sonne of Eleazar the Priest said vnto the children of Reuben and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we perceiue, that the Lord is among vs, because ye haue not done this trespasse against the Lord: nowe ye haue deliuered the children of Israel out of the hand of the Lord. 
\v 32 Then Phinehas the sonne of Eleazar the Priest with the princes returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, vnto the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them answere. 
\v 33 And the saying pleased the children of Israel: and the children of Israel blessed God, and minded not to goe against them in battell, for to destroy the land, wherein the children of Reuben, and Gad dwelt. 
\v 34 Then the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad called the altar Ed: for it shall be a witnesse betweene vs, that the Lord is God. 
\c 23  
\p
\v 1 And a long season after that the Lord had giuen rest vnto Israel from all their enemies round about, and Ioshua was olde, and stricken in age, 
\v 2 Then Ioshua called all Israel, and their Elders, and their heads, and their iudges, and their officers, and said vnto them, I am old, and stricken in age. 
\v 3 Also ye haue seene all that the Lord your God hath done vnto al these nations before you, howe the Lord your God him selfe hath fought for you. 
\v 4 Beholde, I haue deuided vnto you by lot these nations that remaine, to be an inheritance according to your tribes, from Iorden, with all the nations that I haue destroyed, euen vnto the great Sea Westward. 
\v 5 And the Lord your God shall expell them before you, and cast them out of your sight, and ye shall possesse their land, as the Lord your God hath said vnto you. 
\v 6 Be ye therefore of a valiant courage, to obserue and doe all that is written in the booke of the Lawe of Moses, that ye turne not therefrom to the right hand nor to the left, 
\v 7 Neither companie with these nations: that is, with them which are left with you, neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to sweare by them, neither serue them nor bowe vnto them: 
\v 8 But sticke fast vnto the Lord your God, as ye haue done vnto this day. 
\v 9 For ye Lord hath cast out before you great nations and mightie, and no man hath stand before your face hitherto. 
\v 10 One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the Lord your God, he fighteth for you, as he hath promised you. 
\v 11 Take good heede therefore vnto your selues, that ye loue the Lord your God. 
\v 12 Els, if ye goe backe, and cleaue vnto the rest of these nations: that is, of them that remaine with you, and shall make marriages with them, and goe vnto them, and they to you, 
\v 13 Knowe ye for certaine, that the Lord your God will cast out no more of these nations from before you: but they shall be a snare and destruction vnto you, and a whip on your sides, and thornes in your eyes, vntill ye perish out of this good land, which ye Lord your God hath giue you. 
\v 14 And beholde, this day do I enter into the way of all ye world, and ye know in al your heartes and in all your soules, that nothing hath failed of all the good things which the Lord your God promised you, but all are come to passe vnto you: nothing hath failed thereof. 
\v 15 Therefore as all good things are come vpon you, which the Lord your God promised you, so shall the Lord bring vpon you euery euill thing, vntill he haue destroyed you out of this good land, which ye Lord your God hath giue you. 
\v 16 When ye shall transgresse the couenant of the Lord your God, which he commanded you, and shall goe and serue other gods, and bowe your selues to them, then shall the wrath of the Lord waxe hote against you, and ye shall perish quickely out of the good lande which he hath giuen you. 
\c 24  
\p
\v 1 And Ioshua assembled againe all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called the Elders of Israel, and their heades, and their iudges, and their officers, and they presented themselues before God. 
\v 2 Then Ioshua said vnto all the people, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt beyond the flood in olde time, euen Terah the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor, and serued other gods. 
\v 3 And I tooke your father Abraham from beyond the flood, and brought him through all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seede, and gaue him Izhak. 
\v 4 And I gaue vnto Izhak, Iaakob and Esau: and I gaue vnto Esau mount Seir, to possesse it: but Iaakob and his children went downe into Egypt. 
\v 5 I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt: and when I had so done among them, I brought you out. 
\v 6 So I brought your fathers out of Egypt, and ye came vnto the Sea, and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with charets and horsemen vnto the red sea. 
\v 7 Then they cryed vnto the Lord, and he put a darkenesse betweene you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea vpon them, and couered them: so your eyes haue seene what I haue done in Egypt also ye dwelt in the wildernesse a long season. 
\v 8 After, I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt beyond Iorden, and they fought with you: but I gaue them into your hand, and ye possessed their countrey, and I destroyed them out of your sight. 
\v 9 Also Balak the sonne of Zippor King of Moab arose and warred against Israel, and sent to call Balaam the sonne of Beor for to curse you, 
\v 10 But I would not heare Balaam: therefore he blessed you, and I deliuered you out of his hand. 
\v 11 And ye went ouer Iorden, and came vnto Iericho, and the men of Iericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hiuites and the Iebusites, and I deliuered them into your hand. 
\v 12 And I sent hornets before you, which cast them out before you, euen the two kings of the Amorites, and not with thy sword, nor with thy bow. 
\v 13 And I haue giuen you a land, wherein ye did not labour, and cities which ye built not, and yee dwell in them, and eate of the vineyards and oliue trees, which yee planted not. 
\v 14 Nowe therefore feare the Lord, and serue him in vprightnesse and in trueth, and put away the gods, which your fathers serued beyonde the flood and in Egypt, and serue the Lord. 
\v 15 And if it seeme euill vnto you to serue the Lord, choose you this day whome yee will serue, whether the gods which your fathers serued (that were beyond the flood) or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwel: but I and mine house will serue the Lord. 
\v 16 Then the people answered and saide, God forbid, that we shoulde forsake the Lord, to serue other gods. 
\v 17 For the Lord our God, he brought vs and our fathers out of the lande of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and he did those great miracles in our sight, and preserued vs in all the way that we went, and among all the people through whome we came. 
\v 18 And the Lord did cast out before vs all the people, euen the Amorites which dwelt in the lande: therefore will we also serue the Lord, for he is our God. 
\v 19 And Ioshua saide vnto the people, Ye can not serue the Lord: for he is an holie God: he is a ielous God: hee will not pardon your iniquitie nor your sinnes. 
\v 20 If yee forsake the Lord and serue strange gods, then he will returne and bring euill vpon you, and consume you, after that hee hath done you good. 
\v 21 And the people saide vnto Ioshua, Nay, but we will serue the Lord. 
\v 22 And Ioshua saide vnto the people, Yee are witnesses against your selues, that yee haue chosen you the Lord, to serue him: and they sayd, We are witnesses. 
\v 23 Then put away nowe, saide he, the strange gods which are among you, and bowe your hearts vnto the Lord God of Israel. 
\v 24 And ye people saide vnto Ioshua, The Lord our God wil we serue, and his voyce wil we obey. 
\v 25 So Ioshua made a couenant with the people the same day, and gaue them an ordinance and lawe in Shechem. 
\v 26 And Ioshua wrote these woordes in the booke of the Lawe of God, and tooke a great stone, and pitched it there vnder an oke that was in the Sanctuarie of the Lord. 
\v 27 And Ioshua saide vnto all the people, Beholde, this stone shall be a witnesse vnto vs: for it hath heard all the wordes of the Lord which he spake with vs: it shall be therefore a witnesse against you, lest yee denie your God. 
\v 28 Then Ioshua let the people depart, euery man vnto his inheritance. 
\v 29 And after these things Ioshua the sonne of Nun, the seruaunt of the Lord died, being an hundreth and ten yeeres olde. 
\v 30 And they buried him in ye border of his inheritance in Timnath-serah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the Northside of mount Gaash. 
\v 31 And Israel serued the Lord all the daies of Ioshua, and all the daies of the Elders that ouerliued Ioshua, and which had knowen all the workes of the Lord that he had done for Israel. 
\v 32 And the bones of Ioseph, which the children of Israel brought out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem in a parcell of ground which Iaakob bought of the sonnes of Hamor the father of Shechem, for an hundreth pieces of siluer, and the children of Ioseph had them in their inheritance. 
\v 33 Also Eleazar the sonne of Aaron died, whome they buried in the hill of Phinehas his sonne, which was giuen him in mount Ephraim.
