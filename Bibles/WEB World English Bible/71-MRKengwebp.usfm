\mt2 The Good News According to 
\mt1 Mark 
\c 1  
\p
\v 1 The beginning of the Good News of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. 
\p
\v 2 As it is written in the prophets, 
\q1 “Behold,\f + \fr 1:2  \ft “Behold”, from “ἰδοὺ”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.\f* I send my messenger before your face, 
\q2 who will prepare your way before you:\x + \xo 1:2  \xt Malachi 3:1\x* 
\q1
\v 3 the voice of one crying in the wilderness, 
\q2 ‘Make ready the way of the Lord! 
\q2 Make his paths straight!’”\x + \xo 1:3  \xt Isaiah 40:3\x* 
\p
\v 4 John came baptizing\f + \fr 1:4  \ft or, immersing\f* in the wilderness and preaching the baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins. 
\v 5 All the country of Judea and all those of Jerusalem went out to him. They were baptized by him in the Jordan river, confessing their sins. 
\v 6 John was clothed with camel’s hair and a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey. 
\v 7 He preached, saying, “After me comes he who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and loosen. 
\v 8 I baptized you in\f + \fr 1:8  \ft The Greek word (en) translated here as “in” could also be translated as “with” in some contexts.\f* water, but he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.” 
\p
\v 9 In those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan. 
\v 10 Immediately coming up from the water, he saw the heavens parting and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. 
\v 11 A voice came out of the sky, “You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.” 
\p
\v 12 Immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness. 
\v 13 He was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals; and the angels were serving him. 
\p
\v 14 Now after John was taken into custody, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the Good News of God’s Kingdom, 
\v 15 and saying, \wj “\+w The\+w* \+w time\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w fulfilled\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w God\+w*’s Kingdom \+w is\+w* \+w at\+w* \+w hand\+w*! \+w Repent\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w believe\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Good\+w* \+w News\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 16 Passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew, the brother of Simon, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen. 
\v 17 Jesus said to them, \wj “\+w Come\+w* \+w after\+w* \+w me\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w make\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w into\+w* fishers \+w for\+w* \+w men\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 18 Immediately they left their nets, and followed him. 
\p
\v 19 Going on a little further from there, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who were also in the boat mending the nets. 
\v 20 Immediately he called them, and they left their father, Zebedee, in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him. 
\p
\v 21 They went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught. 
\v 22 They were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes. 
\v 23 Immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out, 
\v 24 saying, “Ha! What do we have to do with you, Jesus, you Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are: the Holy One of God!” 
\p
\v 25 Jesus rebuked him, saying, \wj “\+w Be\+w* \+w quiet\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w come\+w* \+w out\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w him\+w*!” \wj* 
\p
\v 26 The unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him. 
\v 27 They were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, “What is this? A new teaching? For with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him!” 
\v 28 The report of him went out immediately everywhere into all the region of Galilee and its surrounding area. 
\p
\v 29 Immediately, when they had come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. 
\v 30 Now Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick with a fever, and immediately they told him about her. 
\v 31 He came and took her by the hand and raised her up. The fever left her immediately,\f + \fr 1:31  \ft NU omits “immediately”.\f* and she served them. 
\p
\v 32 At evening, when the sun had set, they brought to him all who were sick and those who were possessed by demons. 
\v 33 All the city was gathered together at the door. 
\v 34 He healed many who were sick with various diseases and cast out many demons. He didn’t allow the demons to speak, because they knew him. 
\p
\v 35 Early in the morning, while it was still dark, he rose up and went out, and departed into a deserted place, and prayed there. 
\v 36 Simon and those who were with him searched for him. 
\v 37 They found him and told him, “Everyone is looking for you.” 
\p
\v 38 He said to them, \wj “\+w Let\+w*’\+w s\+w* \+w go\+w* elsewhere \+w into\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w next\+w* \+w towns\+w*, \+w that\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w may\+w* \+w preach\+w* \+w there\+w* \+w also\+w*, \+w because\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w came\+w* \+w out\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w this\+w* reason.”\wj* 
\v 39 He went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons. 
\p
\v 40 A leper came to him, begging him, kneeling down to him, and saying to him, “If you want to, you can make me clean.” 
\p
\v 41 Being moved with compassion, he stretched out his hand, and touched him, and said to him, \wj “\+w I\+w* \+w want\+w* \+w to\+w*. \+w Be\+w* \+w made\+w* \+w clean\+w*.”\wj* 
\v 42 When he had said this, immediately the leprosy departed from him and he was made clean. 
\v 43 He strictly warned him and immediately sent him out, 
\v 44 and said to him, \wj “\+w See\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w say\+w* \+w nothing\+w* \+w to\+w* anybody, \+w but\+w* \+w go\+w* \+w show\+w* \+w yourself\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w priest\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w offer\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w cleansing\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w things\+w* \+w which\+w* \+w Moses\+w* \+w commanded\+w*, \+w for\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w testimony\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w them\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 45 But he went out, and began to proclaim it much, and to spread about the matter, so that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city, but was outside in desert places. People came to him from everywhere. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 When he entered again into Capernaum after some days, it was heard that he was at home. 
\v 2 Immediately many were gathered together, so that there was no more room, not even around the door; and he spoke the word to them. 
\v 3 Four people came, carrying a paralytic to him. 
\v 4 When they could not come near to him for the crowd, they removed the roof where he was. When they had broken it up, they let down the mat that the paralytic was lying on. 
\v 5 Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, \wj “\+w Son\+w*, \+w your\+w* sins \+w are\+w* forgiven \+w you\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 6 But there were some of the scribes sitting there and reasoning in their hearts, 
\v 7 “Why does this man speak blasphemies like that? Who can forgive sins but God alone?” 
\p
\v 8 Immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, said to them, \wj “\+w Why\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w reason\+w* \+w these\+w* \+w things\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w hearts\+w*? \wj* 
\v 9  \wj \+w Which\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w easier\+w*, \+w to\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w paralytic\+w*, ‘\+w Your\+w* sins \+w are\+w* forgiven;’ \+w or\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w say\+w*, ‘\+w Arise\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w take\+w* \+w up\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w bed\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w walk\+w*’? \wj* 
\v 10  \wj \+w But\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w may\+w* \+w know\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Son\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Man\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w authority\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w earth\+w* \+w to\+w* forgive sins”\wj*—he said to the paralytic— 
\v 11  \wj “\+w I\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w*, \+w arise\+w*, \+w take\+w* \+w up\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w mat\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w go\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w house\+w*.” \wj* 
\p
\v 12 He arose, and immediately took up the mat and went out in front of them all, so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, “We never saw anything like this!” 
\p
\v 13 He went out again by the seaside. All the multitude came to him, and he taught them. 
\v 14 As he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office. He said to him, \wj “Follow \+w me\+w*.”\wj* And he arose and followed him. 
\p
\v 15 He was reclining at the table in his house, and many tax collectors and sinners sat down with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many, and they followed him. 
\v 16 The scribes and the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with the sinners and tax collectors, said to his disciples, “Why is it that he eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners?” 
\p
\v 17 When Jesus heard it, he said to them, \wj “\+w Those\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w healthy\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w no\+w* \+w need\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w physician\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w those\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w sick\+w*. \+w I\+w* \+w came\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w call\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w righteous\+w*, \+w but\+w* sinners \+w to\+w* repentance.”\wj* 
\p
\v 18 John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, and they came and asked him, “Why do John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples don’t fast?” 
\p
\v 19 Jesus said to them, \wj “\+w Can\+w* \+w the\+w* groomsmen \+w fast\+w* \+w while\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w bridegroom\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w them\+w*? \+w As\+w* \+w long\+w* \+w as\+w* \+w they\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w bridegroom\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w them\+w*, \+w they\+w* \+w can\+w*’\+w t\+w* \+w fast\+w*. \wj* 
\v 20  \wj \+w But\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w days\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w come\+w* \+w when\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w bridegroom\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w be\+w* taken away \+w from\+w* \+w them\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w then\+w* \+w they\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w fast\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w day\+w*. \wj* 
\v 21  \wj \+w No\+w* \+w one\+w* \+w sews\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w piece\+w* \+w of\+w* unshrunk \+w cloth\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w an\+w* \+w old\+w* \+w garment\+w*, \+w or\+w* \+w else\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w patch\+w* shrinks \+w and\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w new\+w* tears away \+w from\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w old\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w worse\+w* hole \+w is\+w* \+w made\+w*. \wj* 
\v 22  \wj \+w No\+w* \+w one\+w* puts \+w new\+w* \+w wine\+w* \+w into\+w* \+w old\+w* wineskins; \+w or\+w* \+w else\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w new\+w* \+w wine\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w burst\+w* \+w the\+w* skins, \+w and\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w wine\+w* pours \+w out\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w the\+w* skins \+w will\+w* \+w be\+w* destroyed; \+w but\+w* \+w they\+w* \+w put\+w* \+w new\+w* \+w wine\+w* \+w into\+w* \+w fresh\+w* wineskins.”\wj* 
\p
\v 23 He was going on the Sabbath day through the grain fields; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of grain. 
\v 24 The Pharisees said to him, “Behold, why do they do that which is not lawful on the Sabbath day?” 
\p
\v 25 He said to them, \wj “\+w Did\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w never\+w* read \+w what\+w* \+w David\+w* \+w did\+w* \+w when\+w* \+w he\+w* \+w had\+w* \+w need\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w was\+w* \+w hungry\+w*—\+w he\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w those\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w were\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w him\+w*? \wj* 
\v 26  \wj \+w How\+w* \+w he\+w* \+w entered\+w* \+w into\+w* \+w God\+w*’s \+w house\+w* \+w at\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w time\+w* \+w of\+w* Abiathar \+w the\+w* \+w high\+w* \+w priest\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w ate\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w show\+w* bread, \+w which\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w lawful\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w eat\+w* \+w except\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w priests\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w gave\+w* \+w also\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w those\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w were\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w him\+w*?”\wj* 
\p
\v 27 He said to them, \wj “\+w The\+w* \+w Sabbath\+w* \+w was\+w* \+w made\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w man\+w*, \+w not\+w* \+w man\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Sabbath\+w*. \wj* 
\v 28  \wj \+w Therefore\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Son\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Man\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w lord\+w* \+w even\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Sabbath\+w*.”\wj* 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 He entered again into the synagogue, and there was a man there whose hand was withered. 
\v 2 They watched him, whether he would heal him on the Sabbath day, that they might accuse him. 
\v 3 He said to the man whose hand was withered, \wj “\+w Stand\+w* \+w up\+w*.”\wj* 
\v 4 He said to them, \wj “\+w Is\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w lawful\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Sabbath\+w* \+w day\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w good\+w* \+w or\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w harm\+w*? \+w To\+w* \+w save\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w life\+w* \+w or\+w* \+w to\+w* kill?”\wj* But they were silent. 
\v 5 When he had looked around at them with anger, being grieved at the hardening of their hearts, he said to the man, \wj “\+w Stretch\+w* \+w out\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w hand\+w*.” \wj* He stretched it out, and his hand was restored as healthy as the other. 
\v 6 The Pharisees went out, and immediately conspired with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him. 
\p
\v 7 Jesus withdrew to the sea with his disciples; and a great multitude followed him from Galilee, from Judea, 
\v 8 from Jerusalem, from Idumaea, beyond the Jordan, and those from around Tyre and Sidon. A great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came to him. 
\v 9 He spoke to his disciples that a little boat should stay near him because of the crowd, so that they wouldn’t press on him. 
\v 10 For he had healed many, so that as many as had diseases pressed on him that they might touch him. 
\v 11 The unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, fell down before him and cried, “You are the Son of God!” 
\v 12 He sternly warned them that they should not make him known. 
\p
\v 13 He went up into the mountain and called to himself those whom he wanted, and they went to him. 
\v 14 He appointed twelve, that they might be with him, and that he might send them out to preach 
\v 15 and to have authority to heal sicknesses and to cast out demons: 
\v 16 Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter); 
\v 17 James the son of Zebedee; and John, the brother of James, (whom he called Boanerges, which means, Sons of Thunder); 
\v 18 Andrew; Philip; Bartholomew; Matthew; Thomas; James, the son of Alphaeus; Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot; 
\v 19 and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. 
\p Then he came into a house. 
\v 20 The multitude came together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread. 
\v 21 When his friends heard it, they went out to seize him; for they said, “He is insane.” 
\v 22 The scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, “He has Beelzebul,” and, “By the prince of the demons he casts out the demons.” 
\p
\v 23 He summoned them and said to them in parables, \wj “\+w How\+w* \+w can\+w* \+w Satan\+w* \+w cast\+w* \+w out\+w* \+w Satan\+w*? \wj* 
\v 24  \wj \+w If\+w* \+w a\+w* kingdom \+w is\+w* \+w divided\+w* \+w against\+w* \+w itself\+w*, \+w that\+w* kingdom \+w cannot\+w* \+w stand\+w*. \wj*

\p
\v 28  \wj “Most \+w certainly\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w*, \+w all\+w* sins \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w descendants\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w man\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w be\+w* forgiven, \+w including\+w* \+w their\+w* blasphemies \+w with\+w* \+w which\+w* \+w they\+w* \+w may\+w* blaspheme; \wj*

\v 30 —because they said, “He has an unclean spirit.” 
\p
\v 31 His mother and his brothers came, and standing outside, they sent to him, calling him. 
\v 32 A multitude was sitting around him, and they told him, “Behold, your mother, your brothers, and your sisters\f + \fr 3:32  \ft TR omits “your sisters”\f* are outside looking for you.” 
\p
\v 33 He answered them, \wj “\+w Who\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w mother\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w my\+w* brothers?”\wj* 
\v 34 Looking around at those who sat around him, he said, \wj “\+w Behold\+w*, \+w my\+w* \+w mother\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w my\+w* brothers! \wj* 
\v 35  \wj \+w For\+w* \+w whoever\+w* \+w does\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w God\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w my\+w* brother, \+w my\+w* sister, \+w and\+w* \+w mother\+w*.”\wj* 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 Again he began to teach by the seaside. A great multitude was gathered to him, so that he entered into a boat in the sea and sat down. All the multitude were on the land by the sea. 
\v 2 He taught them many things in parables, and told them in his teaching, 
\v 3  \wj “\+w Listen\+w*! \+w Behold\+w*, \+w the\+w* farmer \+w went\+w* \+w out\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w sow\+w*. \wj*

\p
\v 33 With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it. 
\v 34 Without a parable he didn’t speak to them; but privately to his own disciples he explained everything.

\v 35 On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, \wj “\+w Let\+w*’s \+w go\+w* \+w over\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w other\+w* \+w side\+w*.”\wj* 
\v 36 Leaving the multitude, they took him with them, even as he was, in the boat. Other small boats were also with him. 
\v 37 A big wind storm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so much that the boat was already filled. 
\v 38 He himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion; and they woke him up and asked him, “Teacher, don’t you care that we are dying?” 
\p
\v 39 He awoke and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, \wj “\+w Peace\+w*! \+w Be\+w* \+w still\+w*!”\wj* The wind ceased and there was a great calm. 
\v 40 He said to them, \wj “\+w Why\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w so\+w* \+w afraid\+w*? \+w How\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w no\+w* \+w faith\+w*?”\wj* 
\p
\v 41 They were greatly afraid and said to one another, “Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?” 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 They came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes. 
\v 2 When he had come out of the boat, immediately a man with an unclean spirit met him out of the tombs. 
\v 3 He lived in the tombs. Nobody could bind him any more, not even with chains, 
\v 4 because he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and the fetters broken in pieces. Nobody had the strength to tame him. 
\v 5 Always, night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out, and cutting himself with stones. 
\v 6 When he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and bowed down to him, 
\v 7 and crying out with a loud voice, he said, “What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I adjure you by God, don’t torment me.” 
\v 8 For he said to him, \wj “\+w Come\+w* \+w out\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* man, \+w you\+w* unclean \+w spirit\+w*!” \wj* 
\p
\v 9 He asked him, \wj “\+w What\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w name\+w*?”\wj* 
\p He said to him, “My name is Legion, for we are many.” 
\v 10 He begged him much that he would not send them away out of the country. 
\v 11 Now on the mountainside there was a great herd of pigs feeding. 
\v 12 All the demons begged him, saying, “Send us into the pigs, that we may enter into them.” 
\p
\v 13 At once Jesus gave them permission. The unclean spirits came out and entered into the pigs. The herd of about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and they were drowned in the sea. 
\v 14 Those who fed the pigs fled, and told it in the city and in the country. 
\p The people came to see what it was that had happened. 
\v 15 They came to Jesus, and saw him who had been possessed by demons sitting, clothed, and in his right mind, even him who had the legion; and they were afraid. 
\v 16 Those who saw it declared to them what happened to him who was possessed by demons, and about the pigs. 
\v 17 They began to beg him to depart from their region. 
\p
\v 18 As he was entering into the boat, he who had been possessed by demons begged him that he might be with him. 
\v 19 He didn’t allow him, but said to him, \wj “\+w Go\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w house\+w*, \+w to\+w* \+w your\+w* friends, \+w and\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w them\+w* \+w what\+w* \+w great\+w* \+w things\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Lord\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w done\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w how\+w* \+w he\+w* \+w had\+w* \+w mercy\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w you\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 20 He went his way, and began to proclaim in Decapolis how Jesus had done great things for him, and everyone marveled. 
\p
\v 21 When Jesus had crossed back over in the boat to the other side, a great multitude was gathered to him; and he was by the sea. 
\v 22 Behold, one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name, came; and seeing him, he fell at his feet 
\v 23 and begged him much, saying, “My little daughter is at the point of death. Please come and lay your hands on her, that she may be made healthy, and live.” 
\p
\v 24 He went with him, and a great multitude followed him, and they pressed upon him on all sides. 
\v 25 A certain woman who had a discharge of blood for twelve years, 
\v 26 and had suffered many things by many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better, but rather grew worse, 
\v 27 having heard the things concerning Jesus, came up behind him in the crowd and touched his clothes. 
\v 28 For she said, “If I just touch his clothes, I will be made well.” 
\v 29 Immediately the flow of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction. 
\p
\v 30 Immediately Jesus, perceiving in himself that the power had gone out from him, turned around in the crowd and asked, \wj “\+w Who\+w* touched \+w my\+w* \+w clothes\+w*?”\wj* 
\p
\v 31 His disciples said to him, “You see the multitude pressing against you, and you say, ‘Who touched me?’” 
\p
\v 32 He looked around to see her who had done this thing. 
\v 33 But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth. 
\p
\v 34 He said to her, \wj “\+w Daughter\+w*, \+w your\+w* \+w faith\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w made\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w well\+w*. \+w Go\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w peace\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w cured\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w disease\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 35 While he was still speaking, people came from the synagogue ruler’s house, saying, “Your daughter is dead. Why bother the Teacher any more?” 
\p
\v 36 But Jesus, when he heard the message spoken, immediately said to the ruler of the synagogue, \wj “Don’\+w t\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w afraid\+w*, \+w only\+w* \+w believe\+w*.”\wj* 
\v 37 He allowed no one to follow him except Peter, James, and John the brother of James. 
\v 38 He came to the synagogue ruler’s house, and he saw an uproar, weeping, and great wailing. 
\v 39 When he had entered in, he said to them, \wj “\+w Why\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w make\+w* \+w an\+w* \+w uproar\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w weep\+w*? \+w The\+w* \+w child\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w not\+w* dead, \+w but\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w asleep\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 40 They ridiculed him. But he, having put them all out, took the father of the child, her mother, and those who were with him, and went in where the child was lying. 
\v 41 Taking the child by the hand, he said to her, \wj “\+w Talitha\+w* \+w cumi\+w*!” \wj* which means, being interpreted, \wj “\+w Girl\+w*, \+w I\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w*, \+w get\+w* \+w up\+w*!” \wj* 
\v 42 Immediately the girl rose up and walked, for she was twelve years old. They were amazed with great amazement. 
\v 43 He strictly ordered them that no one should know this, and commanded that something should be given to her to eat. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1 He went out from there. He came into his own country, and his disciples followed him. 
\v 2 When the Sabbath had come, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many hearing him were astonished, saying, “Where did this man get these things?” and, “What is the wisdom that is given to this man, that such mighty works come about by his hands? 
\v 3 Isn’t this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James, Joses, Judah, and Simon? Aren’t his sisters here with us?” So they were offended at him. 
\p
\v 4 Jesus said to them, \wj “\+w A\+w* \+w prophet\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w without\+w* honor, \+w except\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w his\+w* \+w own\+w* \+w country\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w among\+w* \+w his\+w* \+w own\+w* \+w relatives\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w his\+w* \+w own\+w* \+w house\+w*.”\wj* 
\v 5 He could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and healed them. 
\v 6 He marveled because of their unbelief. 
\p He went around the villages teaching. 
\v 7 He called to himself the twelve, and began to send them out two by two; and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits. 
\v 8 He commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, except a staff only: no bread, no wallet, no money in their purse,

\p
\v 12 They went out and preached that people should repent. 
\v 13 They cast out many demons, and anointed many with oil who were sick and healed them. 
\v 14 King Herod heard this, for his name had become known, and he said, “John the Baptizer has risen from the dead, and therefore these powers are at work in him.” 
\v 15 But others said, “He is Elijah.” Others said, “He is a prophet, or like one of the prophets.” 
\v 16 But Herod, when he heard this, said, “This is John, whom I beheaded. He has risen from the dead.” 
\v 17 For Herod himself had sent out and arrested John and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, for he had married her. 
\v 18 For John had said to Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife.” 
\v 19 Herodias set herself against him and desired to kill him, but she couldn’t, 
\v 20 for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. When he heard him, he did many things, and he heard him gladly. 
\p
\v 21 Then a convenient day came when Herod on his birthday made a supper for his nobles, the high officers, and the chief men of Galilee. 
\v 22 When the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced, she pleased Herod and those sitting with him. The king said to the young lady, “Ask me whatever you want, and I will give it to you.” 
\v 23 He swore to her, “Whatever you ask of me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom.” 
\p
\v 24 She went out and said to her mother, “What shall I ask?” 
\p She said, “The head of John the Baptizer.” 
\p
\v 25 She came in immediately with haste to the king and requested, “I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptizer on a platter.” 
\p
\v 26 The king was exceedingly sorry, but for the sake of his oaths and of his dinner guests, he didn’t wish to refuse her. 
\v 27 Immediately the king sent out a soldier of his guard and commanded to bring John’s head; and he went and beheaded him in the prison, 
\v 28 and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the young lady; and the young lady gave it to her mother. 
\p
\v 29 When his disciples heard this, they came and took up his corpse and laid it in a tomb. 
\p
\v 30 The apostles gathered themselves together to Jesus, and they told him all things, whatever they had done, and whatever they had taught. 
\v 31 He said to them, \wj “\+w Come\+w* \+w away\+w* \+w into\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w deserted\+w* \+w place\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w rest\+w* awhile.”\wj* For there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat. 
\v 32 They went away in the boat to a deserted place by themselves. 
\v 33 They\f + \fr 6:33  \ft TR reads “The multitudes” instead of “They”\f* saw them going, and many recognized him and ran there on foot from all the cities. They arrived before them and came together to him. 
\v 34 Jesus came out, saw a great multitude, and he had compassion on them because they were like sheep without a shepherd; and he began to teach them many things. 
\v 35 When it was late in the day, his disciples came to him and said, “This place is deserted, and it is late in the day. 
\v 36 Send them away, that they may go into the surrounding country and villages and buy themselves bread, for they have nothing to eat.” 
\p
\v 37 But he answered them, \wj “\+w You\+w* \+w give\+w* \+w them\+w* something \+w to\+w* \+w eat\+w*.”\wj* 
\p They asked him, “Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii\f + \fr 6:37  \ft 200 denarii was about 7 or 8 months wages for an agricultural laborer.\f* worth of bread and give them something to eat?” 
\p
\v 38 He said to them, \wj “\+w How\+w* \+w many\+w* loaves \+w do\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w have\+w*? \+w Go\+w* \+w see\+w*.”\wj* 
\p When they knew, they said, “Five, and two fish.” 
\p
\v 39 He commanded them that everyone should sit down in groups on the green grass. 
\v 40 They sat down in ranks, by hundreds and by fifties. 
\v 41 He took the five loaves and the two fish; and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke the loaves, and he gave to his disciples to set before them, and he divided the two fish among them all. 
\v 42 They all ate and were filled. 
\v 43 They took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and also of the fish. 
\v 44 Those who ate the loaves were\f + \fr 6:44  \ft TR adds “about”\f* five thousand men. 
\p
\v 45 Immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and go ahead to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he himself sent the multitude away. 
\v 46 After he had taken leave of them, he went up the mountain to pray. 
\p
\v 47 When evening had come, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and he was alone on the land. 
\v 48 Seeing them distressed in rowing, for the wind was contrary to them, about the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea; \x + \xo 6:48  \xt See Job 9:8\x* and he would have passed by them, 
\v 49 but they, when they saw him walking on the sea, supposed that it was a ghost, and cried out; 
\v 50 for they all saw him and were troubled. But he immediately spoke with them and said to them, \wj “Cheer \+w up\+w*! \+w It\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w I\+w*!\wj*\f + \fr 6:50  \ft or, “I AM!”\f* \wj Don’\+w t\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w afraid\+w*.”\wj* 
\v 51 He got into the boat with them; and the wind ceased, and they were very amazed among themselves, and marveled; 
\v 52 for they hadn’t understood about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened. 
\p
\v 53 When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret and moored to the shore. 
\v 54 When they had come out of the boat, immediately the people recognized him, 
\v 55 and ran around that whole region, and began to bring those who were sick on their mats to where they heard he was. 
\v 56 Wherever he entered—into villages, or into cities, or into the country—they laid the sick in the marketplaces and begged him that they might just touch the fringe\f + \fr 6:56  \ft or, tassel\f* of his garment; and as many as touched him were made well.

\p
\v 1 Then the Pharisees and some of the scribes gathered together to him, having come from Jerusalem. 
\v 2 Now when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with defiled, that is unwashed, hands, they found fault. 
\v 3 (For the Pharisees and all the Jews don’t eat unless they wash their hands and forearms, holding to the tradition of the elders. 
\v 4 They don’t eat when they come from the marketplace unless they bathe themselves, and there are many other things which they have received to hold to: washings of cups, pitchers, bronze vessels, and couches.) 
\v 5 The Pharisees and the scribes asked him, “Why don’t your disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with unwashed hands?” 
\p
\v 6 He answered them, \wj “\+w Well\+w* \+w did\+w* \+w Isaiah\+w* \+w prophesy\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w hypocrites\+w*, \+w as\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w written\+w*,\wj*

\v 24 From there he arose and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. He entered into a house and didn’t want anyone to know it, but he couldn’t escape notice. 
\v 25 For a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet. 
\v 26 Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. She begged him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter. 
\v 27 But Jesus said to her, \wj “\+w Let\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w children\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w filled\+w* \+w first\+w*, \+w for\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w not\+w* appropriate \+w to\+w* \+w take\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w children\+w*’s bread \+w and\+w* throw \+w it\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w dogs\+w*.” \wj*

\v 31 Again he departed from the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and came to the sea of Galilee through the middle of the region of Decapolis. 
\v 32 They brought to him one who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech. They begged him to lay his hand on him. 
\v 33 He took him aside from the multitude privately and put his fingers into his ears; and he spat and touched his tongue. 
\v 34 Looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, \wj “\+w Ephphatha\+w*!” \wj* that is, \wj “\+w Be\+w* \+w opened\+w*!”\wj* 
\v 35 Immediately his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was released, and he spoke clearly. 
\v 36 He commanded them that they should tell no one, but the more he commanded them, so much the more widely they proclaimed it. 
\v 37 They were astonished beyond measure, saying, “He has done all things well. He makes even the deaf hear and the mute speak!”

\v 1 In those days, when there was a very great multitude, and they had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to himself and said to them,

\p They said, “Seven.” 
\p
\v 6 He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground, and he took the seven loaves. Having given thanks, he broke them and gave them to his disciples to serve, and they served the multitude. 
\v 7 They also had a few small fish. Having blessed them, he said to serve these also. 
\v 8 They ate and were filled. They took up seven baskets of broken pieces that were left over. 
\v 9 Those who had eaten were about four thousand. Then he sent them away. 
\p
\v 10 Immediately he entered into the boat with his disciples and came into the region of Dalmanutha. 
\v 11 The Pharisees came out and began to question him, seeking from him a sign from heaven and testing him.

\v 13 He left them, and again entering into the boat, departed to the other side.

\p
\v 24 He looked up, and said, “I see men, but I see them like walking trees.”

\v 25 Then again he laid his hands on his eyes. He looked intently, and was restored, and saw everyone clearly. 
\v 26 He sent him away to his house, saying, \wj “Don’\+w t\+w* \+w enter\+w* \+w into\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w village\+w*, \+w nor\+w* \+w tell\+w* anyone \+w in\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w village\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 27 Jesus went out, with his disciples, into the villages of Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked his disciples, \wj “\+w Who\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w men\+w* \+w say\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w am\+w*?” \wj* 
\p
\v 28 They told him, “John the Baptizer, and others say Elijah, but others, one of the prophets.” 
\p
\v 29 He said to them, \wj “\+w But\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w say\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w am\+w*?”\wj* 
\p Peter answered, “You are the Christ.” 
\p
\v 30 He commanded them that they should tell no one about him. 
\v 31 He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again. 
\v 32 He spoke to them openly. Peter took him and began to rebuke him. 
\v 33 But he, turning around and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter, and said, \wj “\+w Get\+w* \+w behind\+w* \+w me\+w*, \+w Satan\+w*! \+w For\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w mind\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w things\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w God\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w things\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w men\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 34 He called the multitude to himself with his disciples and said to them, \wj “\+w Whoever\+w* \+w wants\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w come\+w* \+w after\+w* \+w me\+w*, \+w let\+w* \+w him\+w* \+w deny\+w* \+w himself\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w take\+w* \+w up\+w* \+w his\+w* \+w cross\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w follow\+w* \+w me\+w*. \wj*

\p
\v 1 He said to them, \wj “\+w Most\+w* \+w certainly\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w*, \+w there\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w some\+w* \+w standing\+w* \+w here\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w no\+w* \+w way\+w* \+w taste\+w* \+w death\+w* \+w until\+w* \+w they\+w* \+w see\+w* \+w God\+w*’s Kingdom \+w come\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w power\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 2 After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John, and brought them up onto a high mountain privately by themselves, and he was changed into another form in front of them. 
\v 3 His clothing became glistening, exceedingly white, like snow, such as no launderer on earth can whiten them. 
\v 4 Elijah and Moses appeared to them, and they were talking with Jesus. 
\p
\v 5 Peter answered Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let’s make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” 
\v 6 For he didn’t know what to say, for they were very afraid. 
\p
\v 7 A cloud came, overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud, “This is my beloved Son. Listen to him.” 
\p
\v 8 Suddenly looking around, they saw no one with them any more, except Jesus only. 
\p
\v 9 As they were coming down from the mountain, he commanded them that they should tell no one what things they had seen, until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead. 
\v 10 They kept this saying to themselves, questioning what the “rising from the dead” meant. 
\p
\v 11 They asked him, saying, “Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?” 
\p
\v 12 He said to them, \wj “\+w Elijah\+w* \+w indeed\+w* \+w comes\+w* \+w first\+w*, \+w and\+w* restores \+w all\+w* \+w things\+w*. \+w How\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w written\+w* \+w about\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Son\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Man\+w*, \+w that\+w* \+w he\+w* \+w should\+w* \+w suffer\+w* \+w many\+w* \+w things\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w despised\+w*? \wj*

\p
\v 14 Coming to the disciples, he saw a great multitude around them, and scribes questioning them. 
\v 15 Immediately all the multitude, when they saw him, were greatly amazed, and running to him, greeted him. 
\v 16 He asked the scribes, \wj “\+w What\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w asking\+w* \+w them\+w*?”\wj* 
\p
\v 17 One of the multitude answered, “Teacher, I brought to you my son, who has a mute spirit; 
\v 18 and wherever it seizes him, it throws him down; and he foams at the mouth, grinds his teeth, and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to cast it out, and they weren’t able.” 
\p
\v 19 He answered him, \wj “Unbelieving \+w generation\+w*, \+w how\+w* \+w long\+w* \+w shall\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w you\+w*? \+w How\+w* \+w long\+w* \+w shall\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w bear\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w you\+w*? \+w Bring\+w* \+w him\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w me\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 20 They brought him to him, and when he saw him, immediately the spirit convulsed him and he fell on the ground, wallowing and foaming at the mouth. 
\p
\v 21 He asked his father, \wj “\+w How\+w* \+w long\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w been\+w* \+w since\+w* \+w this\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w been\+w* \+w happening\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w him\+w*?”\wj* 
\p He said, “From childhood. 
\v 22 Often it has cast him both into the fire and into the water to destroy him. But if you can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.” 
\p
\v 23 Jesus said to him, \wj “\+w If\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w can\+w* \+w believe\+w*, \+w all\+w* \+w things\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w possible\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w him\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w believes\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 24 Immediately the father of the child cried out with tears, “I believe. Help my unbelief!” 
\p
\v 25 When Jesus saw that a multitude came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to him, \wj “\+w You\+w* \+w mute\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w deaf\+w* \+w spirit\+w*, \+w I\+w* \+w command\+w* \+w you\+w*, \+w come\+w* \+w out\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w him\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w never\+w* \+w enter\+w* \+w him\+w* \+w again\+w*!”\wj* 
\p
\v 26 After crying out and convulsing him greatly, it came out of him. The boy became like one dead, so much that most of them said, “He is dead.” 
\v 27 But Jesus took him by the hand and raised him up; and he arose. 
\p
\v 28 When he had come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, “Why couldn’t we cast it out?” 
\p
\v 29 He said to them, \wj “\+w This\+w* \+w kind\+w* \+w can\+w* \+w come\+w* \+w out\+w* \+w by\+w* \+w nothing\+w* \+w but\+w* \+w by\+w* \+w prayer\+w* \+w and\+w* fasting.”\wj* 
\p
\v 30 They went out from there and passed through Galilee. He didn’t want anyone to know it, 
\v 31 for he was teaching his disciples, and said to them, \wj “\+w The\+w* \+w Son\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Man\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w being\+w* \+w handed\+w* \+w over\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w hands\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w men\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w they\+w* \+w will\+w* kill \+w him\+w*; \+w and\+w* \+w when\+w* \+w he\+w* \+w is\+w* killed, \+w on\+w* \+w the\+w* third \+w day\+w* \+w he\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w rise\+w* \+w again\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 32 But they didn’t understand the saying, and were afraid to ask him. 
\p
\v 33 He came to Capernaum, and when he was in the house he asked them, \wj “\+w What\+w* \+w were\+w* \+w you\+w* arguing \+w among\+w* \+w yourselves\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w way\+w*?”\wj* 
\p
\v 34 But they were silent, for they had disputed with one another on the way about who was the greatest. 
\p
\v 35 He sat down and called the twelve; and he said to them, \wj “\+w If\+w* \+w any\+w* \+w man\+w* \+w wants\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w first\+w*, \+w he\+w* \+w shall\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w last\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w all\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w servant\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w all\+w*.”\wj* 
\v 36 He took a little child and set him in the middle of them. Taking him in his arms, he said to them, 
\v 37  \wj “\+w Whoever\+w* \+w receives\+w* \+w one\+w* \+w such\+w* little \+w child\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w name\+w* \+w receives\+w* \+w me\+w*; \+w and\+w* \+w whoever\+w* \+w receives\+w* \+w me\+w*, doesn’\+w t\+w* \+w receive\+w* \+w me\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w him\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w sent\+w* \+w me\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 38 John said to him, “Teacher, we saw someone who doesn’t follow us casting out demons in your name; and we forbade him, because he doesn’t follow us.” 
\p
\v 39 But Jesus said, \wj “Don’\+w t\+w* \+w forbid\+w* \+w him\+w*, \+w for\+w* \+w there\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w no\+w* \+w one\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w mighty\+w* \+w work\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w name\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w able\+w* \+w quickly\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w speak\+w* \+w evil\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w me\+w*. \wj*

\v 46 They came to Jericho. As he went out from Jericho with his disciples and a great multitude, the son of Timaeus, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the road. 
\v 47 When he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out and say, “Jesus, you son of David, have mercy on me!” 
\v 48 Many rebuked him, that he should be quiet, but he cried out much more, “You son of David, have mercy on me!” 
\p
\v 49 Jesus stood still and said, \wj “\+w Call\+w* \+w him\+w*.”\wj*

\v 50 He, casting away his cloak, sprang up, and came to Jesus.

\v 4 They went away, and found a young donkey tied at the door outside in the open street, and they untied him. 
\v 5 Some of those who stood there asked them, “What are you doing, untying the young donkey?” 
\v 6 They said to them just as Jesus had said, and they let them go. 
\p
\v 7 They brought the young donkey to Jesus and threw their garments on it, and Jesus sat on it. 
\v 8 Many spread their garments on the way, and others were cutting down branches from the trees and spreading them on the road.

\v 11 Jesus entered into the temple in Jerusalem. When he had looked around at everything, it being now evening, he went out to Bethany with the twelve. 
\p
\v 12 The next day, when they had come out from Bethany, he was hungry. 
\v 13 Seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came to see if perhaps he might find anything on it. When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs.

\v 15 They came to Jerusalem, and Jesus entered into the temple and began to throw out those who sold and those who bought in the temple, and overthrew the money changers’ tables and the seats of those who sold the doves. 
\v 16 He would not allow anyone to carry a container through the temple. 
\v 17 He taught, saying to them, \wj “Isn’\+w t\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w written\+w*, ‘\+w My\+w* \+w house\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w called\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w house\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w prayer\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w all\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w nations\+w*’?\wj*\x + \xo 11:17  \xt Isaiah 56:7\x* \wj \+w But\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w made\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w den\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w robbers\+w*!”\wj*\x + \xo 11:17  \xt Jeremiah 7:11\x*

\v 20 As they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots.

\v 12 They tried to seize him, but they feared the multitude; for they perceived that he spoke the parable against them. They left him and went away. 
\v 13 They sent some of the Pharisees and the Herodians to him, that they might trap him with words. 
\v 14 When they had come, they asked him, “Teacher, we know that you are honest, and don’t defer to anyone; for you aren’t partial to anyone, but truly teach the way of God. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not? 
\v 15 Shall we give, or shall we not give?”

\v 18 Some Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection, came to him. They asked him, saying, 
\v 19 “Teacher, Moses wrote to us, ‘If a man’s brother dies and leaves a wife behind him, and leaves no children, that his brother should take his wife and raise up offspring for his brother.’ 
\v 20 There were seven brothers. The first took a wife, and dying left no offspring. 
\v 21 The second took her, and died, leaving no children behind him. The third likewise; 
\v 22 and the seven took her and left no children. Last of all the woman also died. 
\v 23 In the resurrection, when they rise, whose wife will she be of them? For the seven had her as a wife.”

\v 28 One of the scribes came and heard them questioning together, and knowing that he had answered them well, asked him, “Which commandment is the greatest of all?”

\v 32 The scribe said to him, “Truly, teacher, you have said well that he is one, and there is none other but he; 
\v 33 and to love him with all the heart, with all the understanding, all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, is more important than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.”

\v 41 Jesus sat down opposite the treasury and saw how the multitude cast money into the treasury. Many who were rich cast in much. 
\v 42 A poor widow came and she cast in two small brass coins,\f + \fr 12:42  \ft literally, lepta (or widow’s mites). Lepta are very small brass coins worth half a quadrans each, which is a quarter of the copper assarion. Lepta are worth less than 1% of an agricultural worker’s daily wages.\f* which equal a quadrans coin.\f + \fr 12:42  \ft A quadrans is a coin worth about 1/64 of a denarius. A denarius is about one day’s wages for an agricultural laborer.\f* 
\v 43 He called his disciples to himself and said to them, \wj “\+w Most\+w* \+w certainly\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w*, \+w this\+w* \+w poor\+w* \+w widow\+w* \+w gave\+w* \+w more\+w* \+w than\+w* \+w all\+w* \+w those\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w are\+w* giving \+w into\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w treasury\+w*, \wj*

\v 3 While he was at Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at the table, a woman came having an alabaster jar of ointment of pure nard—very costly. She broke the jar and poured it over his head.

\v 38  \wj \+w Watch\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w pray\+w*, \+w that\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w may\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w enter\+w* \+w into\+w* \+w temptation\+w*. \+w The\+w* \+w spirit\+w* \+w indeed\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w willing\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w flesh\+w* \+w is\+w* weak.”\wj* 
\p
\v 39 Again he went away and prayed, saying the same words. 
\v 40 Again he returned and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy; and they didn’t know what to answer him. 
\v 41 He came the third time and said to them, \wj “\+w Sleep\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w now\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w take\+w* \+w your\+w* rest. \+w It\+w* \+w is\+w* enough. \+w The\+w* \+w hour\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w come\+w*. \+w Behold\+w*, \+w the\+w* \+w Son\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Man\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w betrayed\+w* \+w into\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w hands\+w* \+w of\+w* sinners. \wj* 
\v 42  \wj \+w Arise\+w*! Let’s \+w get\+w* going. \+w Behold\+w*, \+w he\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w betrays\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w at\+w* \+w hand\+w*.” \wj* 
\p
\v 43 Immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, came—and with him a multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders. 
\v 44 Now he who betrayed him had given them a sign, saying, “Whomever I will kiss, that is he. Seize him, and lead him away safely.” 
\v 45 When he had come, immediately he came to him and said, “Rabbi! Rabbi!” and kissed him. 
\v 46 They laid their hands on him and seized him. 
\v 47 But a certain one of those who stood by drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear. 
\p
\v 48 Jesus answered them, \wj “\+w Have\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w come\+w* \+w out\+w*, \+w as\+w* \+w against\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w robber\+w*, \+w with\+w* \+w swords\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w clubs\+w* \+w to\+w* seize \+w me\+w*? \wj* 
\v 49  \wj \+w I\+w* \+w was\+w* \+w daily\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w temple\+w* \+w teaching\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w you\+w* didn’\+w t\+w* \+w arrest\+w* \+w me\+w*. \+w But\+w* \+w this\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w so\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Scriptures\+w* \+w might\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w fulfilled\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 50 They all left him, and fled. 
\v 51 A certain young man followed him, having a linen cloth thrown around himself over his naked body. The young men grabbed him, 
\v 52 but he left the linen cloth and fled from them naked. 
\v 53 They led Jesus away to the high priest. All the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes came together with him. 
\p
\v 54 Peter had followed him from a distance, until he came into the court of the high priest. He was sitting with the officers, and warming himself in the light of the fire. 
\v 55 Now the chief priests and the whole council sought witnesses against Jesus to put him to death, and found none. 
\v 56 For many gave false testimony against him, and their testimony didn’t agree with each other. 
\v 57 Some stood up and gave false testimony against him, saying, 
\v 58 “We heard him say, ‘I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands.’” 
\v 59 Even so, their testimony didn’t agree. 
\p
\v 60 The high priest stood up in the middle, and asked Jesus, “Have you no answer? What is it which these testify against you?” 
\v 61 But he stayed quiet, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, “Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?” 
\p
\v 62 Jesus said, \wj “\+w I\+w* \+w am\+w*. \+w You\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w see\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Son\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Man\+w* \+w sitting\+w* \+w at\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w right\+w* \+w hand\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Power\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w coming\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w clouds\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w sky\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 63 The high priest tore his clothes and said, “What further need have we of witnesses? 
\v 64 You have heard the blasphemy! What do you think?” They all condemned him to be worthy of death. 
\v 65 Some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to beat him with fists, and to tell him, “Prophesy!” The officers struck him with the palms of their hands. 
\p
\v 66 As Peter was in the courtyard below, one of the maids of the high priest came, 
\v 67 and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him and said, “You were also with the Nazarene, Jesus!” 
\p
\v 68 But he denied it, saying, “I neither know nor understand what you are saying.” He went out on the porch, and the rooster crowed. 
\p
\v 69 The maid saw him and began again to tell those who stood by, “This is one of them.” 
\v 70 But he again denied it. After a little while again those who stood by said to Peter, “You truly are one of them, for you are a Galilean, and your speech shows it.” 
\v 71 But he began to curse and to swear, “I don’t know this man of whom you speak!” 
\p
\v 72 The rooster crowed the second time. Peter remembered the words that Jesus said to him, \wj “\+w Before\+w* \+w the\+w* rooster \+w crows\+w* \+w twice\+w*, \+w you\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w deny\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w three\+w* \+w times\+w*.”\wj* When he thought about that, he wept. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1 Immediately in the morning the chief priests, with the elders, scribes, and the whole council, held a consultation, bound Jesus, carried him away, and delivered him up to Pilate. 
\v 2 Pilate asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” 
\p He answered, \wj “\+w So\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w say\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 3 The chief priests accused him of many things. 
\v 4 Pilate again asked him, “Have you no answer? See how many things they testify against you!” 
\p
\v 5 But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate marveled. 
\p
\v 6 Now at the feast he used to release to them one prisoner, whomever they asked of him. 
\v 7 There was one called Barabbas, bound with his fellow insurgents, men who in the insurrection had committed murder. 
\v 8 The multitude, crying aloud, began to ask him to do as he always did for them. 
\v 9 Pilate answered them, saying, “Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?” 
\v 10 For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up. 
\v 11 But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should release Barabbas to them instead. 
\v 12 Pilate again asked them, “What then should I do to him whom you call the King of the Jews?” 
\p
\v 13 They cried out again, “Crucify him!” 
\p
\v 14 Pilate said to them, “Why, what evil has he done?” 
\p But they cried out exceedingly, “Crucify him!” 
\p
\v 15 Pilate, wishing to please the multitude, released Barabbas to them, and handed over Jesus, when he had flogged him, to be crucified. 
\p
\v 16 The soldiers led him away within the court, which is the Praetorium; and they called together the whole cohort. 
\v 17 They clothed him with purple; and weaving a crown of thorns, they put it on him. 
\v 18 They began to salute him, “Hail, King of the Jews!” 
\v 19 They struck his head with a reed and spat on him, and bowing their knees, did homage to him. 
\v 20 When they had mocked him, they took the purple cloak off him, and put his own garments on him. They led him out to crucify him. 
\p
\v 21 They compelled one passing by, coming from the country, Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with them that he might bear his cross. 
\v 22 They brought him to the place called Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, “The place of a skull.” 
\v 23 They offered him wine mixed with myrrh to drink, but he didn’t take it. 
\p
\v 24 Crucifying him, they parted his garments among them, casting lots on them, what each should take. 
\v 25 It was the third hour\f + \fr 15:25  \ft 9:00 a.m.\f* when they crucified him. 
\v 26 The superscription of his accusation was written over him: “THE KING OF THE JEWS.” 
\v 27 With him they crucified two robbers, one on his right hand, and one on his left. 
\v 28 The Scripture was fulfilled which says, “He was counted with transgressors.”\f + \fr 15:28  \ft NU omits verse 28.\f* 
\p
\v 29 Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads and saying, “Ha! You who destroy the temple and build it in three days, 
\v 30 save yourself, and come down from the cross!” 
\p
\v 31 Likewise, also the chief priests mocking among themselves with the scribes said, “He saved others. He can’t save himself. 
\v 32 Let the Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe him.”\f + \fr 15:32  \ft TR omits “him”\f* Those who were crucified with him also insulted him. 
\p
\v 33 When the sixth hour\f + \fr 15:33  \ft or, noon\f* had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.\f + \fr 15:33  \ft 3:00 p.m.\f* 
\v 34 At the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, \wj “\+w Eloi\+w*, \+w Eloi\+w*, \+w lama\+w* \+w sabachthani\+w*?”\wj* which is, being interpreted, \wj “\+w My\+w* \+w God\+w*, \+w my\+w* \+w God\+w*, \+w why\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w forsaken\+w* \+w me\+w*?”\wj* \x + \xo 15:34  \xt Psalms 22:1\x* 
\p
\v 35 Some of those who stood by, when they heard it, said, “Behold, he is calling Elijah.” 
\p
\v 36 One ran, and filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink, saying, “Let him be. Let’s see whether Elijah comes to take him down.” 
\p
\v 37 Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and gave up the spirit. 
\v 38 The veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom. 
\v 39 When the centurion, who stood by opposite him, saw that he cried out like this and breathed his last, he said, “Truly this man was the Son of God!” 
\p
\v 40 There were also women watching from afar, among whom were both Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome; 
\v 41 who, when he was in Galilee, followed him and served him; and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem. 
\p
\v 42 When evening had now come, because it was the Preparation Day, that is, the day before the Sabbath, 
\v 43 Joseph of Arimathaea, a prominent council member who also himself was looking for God’s Kingdom, came. He boldly went in to Pilate, and asked for Jesus’ body. 
\v 44 Pilate was surprised to hear that he was already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he had been dead long. 
\v 45 When he found out from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph. 
\v 46 He bought a linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth and laid him in a tomb which had been cut out of a rock. He rolled a stone against the door of the tomb. 
\v 47 Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses, saw where he was laid. 
\c 16  
\p
\v 1 When the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices, that they might come and anoint him. 
\v 2 Very early on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb when the sun had risen. 
\v 3 They were saying among themselves, “Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us?” 
\v 4 for it was very big. Looking up, they saw that the stone was rolled back. 
\p
\v 5 Entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe; and they were amazed. 
\v 6 He said to them, “Don’t be amazed. You seek Jesus, the Nazarene, who has been crucified. He has risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid him! 
\v 7 But go, tell his disciples and Peter, ‘He goes before you into Galilee. There you will see him, as he said to you.’” 
\p
\v 8 They went out,\f + \fr 16:8  \ft TR adds “quickly”\f* and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had come on them. They said nothing to anyone; for they were afraid.\f + \fr 16:8  \ft One isolated manuscript omits verses 9-20 but adds this “short ending of Mark” to the end of verse 8: \fqa They told all that had been commanded them briefly to those around Peter. After that, Jesus himself sent them out, from east to west, with the sacred and imperishable proclamation of eternal salvation.\f* 
\p
\v 9  \f + \fr 16:9  \ft NU includes the text of verses 9-20, but mentions in a footnote that a few manuscripts omitted it. The translators of the World English Bible regard Mark 16:9-20 as reliable based on an overwhelming majority of textual evidence, including not only the authoritative Greek Majority Text New Testament, but also the TR and many of the manuscripts cited in the NU text.\f* Now when he had risen early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons. 
\v 10 She went and told those who had been with him, as they mourned and wept. 
\v 11 When they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, they disbelieved. 
\p
\v 12 After these things he was revealed in another form to two of them as they walked, on their way into the country. 
\v 13 They went away and told it to the rest. They didn’t believe them, either. 
\p
\v 14 Afterward he was revealed to the eleven themselves as they sat at the table; and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they didn’t believe those who had seen him after he had risen. 
\v 15 He said to them, \wj “\+w Go\+w* \+w into\+w* \+w all\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w world\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w preach\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Good\+w* \+w News\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w whole\+w* \+w creation\+w*. \wj* 
\v 16  \wj \+w He\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w believes\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w is\+w* baptized \+w will\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w saved\+w*; \+w but\+w* \+w he\+w* \+w who\+w* disbelieves \+w will\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w condemned\+w*. \wj* 
\v 17  \wj \+w These\+w* \+w signs\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w accompany\+w* \+w those\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w believe\+w*: \+w in\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w name\+w* \+w they\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w cast\+w* \+w out\+w* \+w demons\+w*; \+w they\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w speak\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w new\+w* \+w languages\+w*; \wj* 
\v 18  \wj \+w they\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w take\+w* \+w up\+w* \+w serpents\+w*; \+w and\+w* \+w if\+w* \+w they\+w* \+w drink\+w* \+w any\+w* \+w deadly\+w* \+w thing\+w*, \+w it\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w no\+w* \+w way\+w* hurt \+w them\+w*; \+w they\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w lay\+w* \+w hands\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w the\+w* sick, \+w and\+w* \+w they\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w recover\+w*.”\wj* 
\p
\v 19 So then the Lord,\f + \fr 16:19  \ft NU adds “Jesus”\f* after he had spoken to them, was received up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God. 
\v 20 They went out and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them and confirming the word by the signs that followed. Amen.
