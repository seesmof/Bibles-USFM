\s1 The Birth, Parentage and Infancy 
\p
\v 1 A genealogy of Jesus Christ, a descendant of David and Abraham. 
\v 2 Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac of Jacob, Jacob of Judah and his brothers, 
\v 3 Judah of Perez and Zerah, whose mother was Tamar, Perez of Hezron, Hezron of Aram, 
\v 4 Aram of Aminadab, Aminadab of Nahshon, Nahshon of Salmon, 
\v 5 Salmon of Boaz, whose mother was Rahab, Boaz of Obed, whose mother was Ruth, Obed of Jesse, 
\v 6 Jesse of David the King. David was the father of Solomon, whose mother was Uriah’s widow, 
\v 7 Solomon of Rehoboam, Rehoboam of Abijah, Abijah of Asa, 
\v 8 Asa of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat of Joram, Joram of Uzziah, 
\v 9 Uzziah of Jotham, Jotham of Ahaz, Ahaz of Hezekiah, 
\v 10 Hezekiah of Manasseh, Manasseh of Amon, Amon of Josiah, 
\v 11 Josiah of Jechoniah and his brothers, at the time of the Exile to Babylon. 
\v 12 After the Exile to Babylon – Jechoniah was the father of Salathiel, Salathiel of Zerubbabel, 
\v 13 Zerubbabel of Abiud, Abiud of Eliakim, Eliakim of Azor, 
\v 14 Azor of Zadok, Zadok of Achim, Achim of Eliud, 
\v 15 Eliud of Eleazar, Eleazar of Matthan, Matthan of Jacob, 
\v 16 Jacob of Joseph, the husband of Mary, who was the mother of Jesus, who is called “Christ”. 
\v 17 So the whole number of generations from Abraham to David is fourteen; from David to the Exile to Babylon fourteen; and from the Exile to Babylon to the Christ fourteen. 
\b
\p
\v 18 This is how Jesus Christ was born: 
\p His mother Mary was engaged to Joseph, but, before the marriage took place, she found herself to be pregnant by the power of the Holy Spirit. 
\v 19 Her husband, Joseph, was a just man and, since he did not want to disgrace her publicly, he resolved to put an end to their engagement privately. 
\v 20 He had been thinking this over, when an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream. 
\p ‘Joseph, son of David,’ the angel said, ‘do not be afraid to take Mary for your wife, for her child has been conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit. 
\v 21 She will give birth to a son; name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.’ 
\p
\v 22 All this happened in fulfilment of these words of the Lord through the prophet, where he says – 
\q1
\v 23 “The virgin will conceive and will give birth to a son, and they will give him the name Immanuel” 
\b
\m – a word which means “God is with us.” 
\v 24 When Joseph woke up, he did as the angel of the Lord had directed him. 
\v 25 He made Mary his wife, but they did not sleep together before the birth of her son; and to this son he gave the name Jesus.

\p
\v 1 After the birth of Jesus at Bethlehem in Judea, in the reign of King Herod, some astrologers from the East arrived in Jerusalem, asking, 
\v 2 ‘Where is the newborn king of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east, and have come to worship him.’ 
\v 3 When King Herod heard of this, he was much troubled, and so too was all Jerusalem. 
\v 4 He called together all the chief priests and teachers of the Law in the nation, and questioned them as to where the Christ was to be born. 
\p
\v 5 ‘At Bethlehem in Judea,’ was their answer, ‘for it is said in the prophet – 
\q1
\v 6 “And you, Bethlehem in Judah’s land, 
\q2 are in no way least among the chief cities of Judah, 
\q1 for out of you will come a ruler – 
\q2 who will shepherd my people Israel.”’ 
\p
\v 7 Then Herod secretly sent for the astrologers. He found out from them the time of the appearance of the star. 
\v 8 Sending them to Bethlehem he said, ‘Go and make a careful search for the child. When you have found him, bring word back to me, so that I, too, can go and worship him.’ 
\v 9 The astrologers heard what the king had to say, and then continued their journey. The star which they had seen in the east led them on, until it reached and stood over the place where the child was. 
\v 10 At the sight of the star they were filled with joy. 
\v 11 Entering the house, they saw the child with his mother, Mary, and fell at his feet and worshipped him. Then they opened their treasure chests, and offered to the child presents of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. 
\v 12 But afterwards, having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their own country by another road. 
\p
\v 13 After they had left, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, and said, ‘Get up, take the child and his mother, and seek refuge in Egypt; and stay there until I tell you to return, for Herod is about to search for the child, to put him to death.’ 
\v 14 Joseph woke up, and taking the child and his mother by night, went into Egypt, 
\v 15 and there he stayed until Herod’s death. This was in fulfilment of these words of the Lord in the prophet, where he says – 
\q1 “Out of Egypt I called my Son.” 
\p
\v 16 When Herod found out that the astrologers had tricked him, he flew into a rage. He sent and put to death all the boys in Bethlehem and the whole of that region, who were two years old or under, guided by the time which he had learned from the astrologers. 
\v 17 Then were fulfilled these words spoken in the prophet Jeremiah, where he says – 
\q1
\v 18 “A voice was heard in Ramah, 
\q2 weeping and mourning loudly; 
\q1 Rachel, weeping for her children, 
\q2 refusing all comfort for they were dead.” 
\p
\v 19 But, on the death of Herod, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, and said, 
\v 20 ‘Get up, take the child and his mother, and go into the Land of Israel, for those who sought to take the child’s life are dead.’ 
\v 21 He woke up, and taking the child and his mother, went into the Land of Israel. 
\v 22 But, hearing that Archelaus had succeeded his father Herod as king of Judea, he was afraid to go back there; and having been warned in a dream, he went into the part of the country called Galilee. 
\v 23 There he settled in the town of Nazareth, in fulfilment of these words in the prophets – “He will be called a Nazarene.”

\s1 The Preparation 
\p
\v 1 About that time John the Baptist first appeared, proclaiming in the wilderness of Judea: 
\v 2 ‘Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.’ 
\v 3 John was the one who was spoken of in the prophet Isaiah, where he says – 
\q1 “The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness: 
\q1 ‘Make ready the way of the Lord, 
\q1 make his paths straight.’” 
\p
\v 4 John’s clothes were made of camels’ hair, with a leather strap round his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey. 
\v 5 At that time Jerusalem, and all Judea, as well as the whole district of the Jordan, went out to him 
\v 6 and were baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins. 
\p
\v 7 But when John saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to receive his baptism, he said to them, ‘You children of snakes! Who has prompted you to seek refuge from the coming judgment? 
\v 8 Let your life, then, prove your repentance; 
\v 9 and do not think that you can say among yourselves “Abraham is our ancestor,” for I tell you that out of these stones God is able to raise descendants for Abraham! 
\v 10 Already the axe is lying at the root of the trees. Therefore every tree that fails to bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire. 
\v 11 I, indeed, baptize you with water to teach repentance; but he who is coming after me is more powerful than I, and I am not fit even to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. 
\v 12 His winnowing-fan is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing-floor, and store his grain in the barn, but the chaff he will burn with a fire that cannot be put out.’ 
\p
\v 13 Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan, to John, to be baptized by him. 
\v 14 But John tried to prevent him. 
\p ‘I need to be baptized by you,’ he said, ‘so why have you come to me?’ 
\p
\v 15  \wj ‘\+w This\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w way\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w should\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w now\+w*,’\wj* Jesus answered, \wj ‘\+w because\+w* \+w we\+w* \+w should\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w everything\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w God\+w* requires.’\wj* So John agreed. 
\p
\v 16 After the baptism of Jesus, and just as he came up from the water, the heavens opened, and he saw the Spirit of God coming down like a dove and resting on him, 
\v 17 and from the heavens there came a voice which said, ‘This is my dearly loved son, who brings me great joy.’ 
\c 4  
\b
\p
\v 1 Then Jesus was led up into the wilderness by the Spirit to be tempted by the devil. 
\v 2 And, after he had fasted for forty days and forty nights, he became hungry. 
\v 3 The Tempter came to him, and said: 
\q1 ‘If you are God’s Son, tell these stones to become loaves of bread.’ 
\b
\m
\v 4 But Jesus answered, \wj ‘\+w Scripture\+w* \+w says\+w* – \wj*
\q1 \wj “\+w It\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w on\+w* bread \+w alone\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w a\+w* person \+w is\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w live\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w every\+w* \+w word\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w comes\+w* \+w from\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w mouth\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w God\+w*.”’\wj* 
\b
\m
\v 5 Then the devil took him to the Holy City, and, placing him on the parapet of the temple, said to him, 
\v 6 ‘If you are God’s Son, throw yourself down, for scripture says – 
\q1 “He will give his angels commands about you, 
\q1 and on their hands they will lift you up, 
\q1 so you do not even strike your foot against a stone.”’ 
\b
\m
\v 7  \wj ‘\+w Scripture\+w* \+w also\+w* \+w says\+w*,’\wj* answered Jesus, 
\q1 \wj ‘“\+w You\+w* \+w must\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w tempt\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Lord\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w God\+w*.”’\wj* 
\b
\m
\v 8 The third time, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain, and, showing him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendour, said to him: 
\q1
\v 9 ‘All these I will give you, if you will fall at my feet and worship me.’ 
\b
\m
\v 10 Then Jesus said to him, \wj ‘\+w Go\+w* \+w away\+w*, \+w Satan\+w*! \+w For\+w* \+w scripture\+w* \+w says\+w* – \wj*
\q1 \wj “\+w You\+w* \+w must\+w* \+w worship\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Lord\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w God\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w worship\+w* \+w him\+w* \+w only\+w*.”’\wj* 
\b
\m
\v 11 Then the devil left him alone, and angels came and helped him. 
\s1 The Work in Galilee 
\p
\v 12 When Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he returned to Galilee. 
\v 13 Afterwards, leaving Nazareth, he went and settled at Capernaum, which is by the side of the sea, within the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali; 
\v 14 in fulfilment of these words in the prophet Isaiah – 
\q1
\v 15 “The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, 
\q1 the land of the Road by the sea, and beyond the Jordan, 
\q2 with Galilee of the Gentiles – 
\q1
\v 16 The people who were living in darkness 
\q2 have seen a great light, 
\q1 and, for those who were living in the shadow-land of death, 
\q2 a light has dawned!” 
\b
\p
\v 17 At that time Jesus began to proclaim – 
\q1 \wj ‘\+w Repent\+w*, \+w for\+w* \+w the\+w* kingdom \+w of\+w* \+w heaven\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w at\+w* \+w hand\+w*.’\wj* 
\p
\v 18 As Jesus was walking along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers – Simon, also known as Peter, and his brother Andrew – casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen. 
\p
\v 19  \wj ‘\+w Come\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w follow\+w* \+w me\+w*,’\wj* Jesus said, \wj ‘\+w and\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w will\+w* teach \+w you\+w* \+w to\+w* fish \+w for\+w* \+w people\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 20 The two men left their nets at once and followed him. 
\v 21 Going further on, he saw two other men who were also brothers, James, Zebedee’s son, and his brother John, in their boat with their father, mending their nets. Jesus called them, 
\v 22 and they at once left their boat and their father, and followed him. 
\p
\v 23 Jesus went all through Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and curing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness among the people; 
\v 24 and his fame spread all through Syria. They brought to him all who were ill with any form of disease, or who were suffering pain – any who were either possessed by demons, or were lunatic, or paralysed; and he cured them. 
\v 25 He was followed by large crowds from Galilee, the district of the Ten Towns, Jerusalem, Judea, and from beyond the Jordan. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 On seeing the crowds of people, Jesus went up the hill; and, when he had taken his seat, his disciples came up to him; 
\v 2 and he began to teach them, saying: 
\q1
\v 3  \wj ‘\+w Blessed\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w poor\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w spirit\+w*,\wj*

\p
\v 28 By the time that Jesus had finished speaking, the crowd was filled with amazement at his teaching. 
\v 29 For he taught them like one who had authority, and not like their teachers of the Law. 
\c 8  
\b
\p
\v 1 When Jesus had come down from the hill, great crowds followed him. 
\v 2 He saw a leper who came up, and bowed to the ground before him, and said, ‘Master, if only you are willing, you are able to make me clean.’ 
\v 3 Stretching out his hand, Jesus touched him, saying as he did so, \wj ‘\+w I\+w* \+w am\+w* \+w willing\+w*; become \+w clean\+w*.’\wj* Instantly he was made clean from his leprosy; 
\v 4 and then Jesus said to him, \wj ‘\+w Be\+w* careful \+w not\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w say\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w word\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w anyone\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w go\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w show\+w* \+w yourself\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w priest\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w offer\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w gift\+w* directed \+w by\+w* \+w Moses\+w*, \+w as\+w* evidence \+w of\+w* \+w your\+w* cure.’\wj* 
\v 5 After Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion in the Roman army came up to him, entreating his help. 
\v 6 ‘Sir,’ he said, ‘my manservant is lying ill at my house with a stroke of paralysis, and is suffering terribly.’ 
\p
\v 7  \wj ‘\+w I\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w come\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w cure\+w* \+w him\+w*,’\wj* answered Jesus. 
\v 8 ‘Sir,’ the centurion went on, ‘I am unworthy to receive you under my roof; but only speak, and my manservant will be cured. 
\v 9 For I myself am a man under the orders of others, with soldiers under me; and, if I say to one of them “Go,” he goes, and to another “Come,” he comes, and to my slave “Do this,” he does it.’ 
\v 10 Jesus was surprised to hear this, and said to those who were following him, \wj ‘Never \+w I\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w*, \+w in\+w* \+w any\+w* Israelite \+w have\+w* \+w I\+w* met \+w with\+w* \+w such\+w* \+w faith\+w* \+w as\+w* \+w this\+w*!\wj* 
\v 11  \wj \+w Yes\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w many\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w come\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w from\+w* East \+w and\+w* \+w West\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w take\+w* \+w their\+w* places beside Abraham, \+w Isaac\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w Jacob\+w*, \+w in\+w* \+w the\+w* kingdom \+w of\+w* \+w heaven\+w*;\wj* 
\v 12  \wj \+w while\+w* \+w the\+w* heirs \+w to\+w* \+w the\+w* kingdom \+w will\+w* \+w be\+w* banished \+w into\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w darkness\+w* \+w outside\+w*; \+w there\+w*, \+w there\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w weeping\+w* \+w and\+w* grinding \+w of\+w* \+w teeth\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 13 Then Jesus said to the centurion, \wj ‘\+w Go\+w* \+w now\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w according\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w faith\+w*.’\wj* And the man was cured that very hour. 
\p
\v 14 When Jesus went into Peter’s house, he saw Peter’s mother-in-law prostrated with fever. 
\v 15 On his taking her hand, the fever left her, and she rose and began to take care of him. 
\v 16 In the evening the people brought to Jesus many who were possessed by demons; and he drove out the spirits with a word, and cured all who were ill, 
\v 17 in fulfilment of these words in the prophet Isaiah – “He took our infirmities on himself, and bore the burden of our diseases.” 
\p
\v 18 Seeing a crowd round him, Jesus gave orders to go across. 
\v 19 A teacher of the Law came up to him, and said, ‘Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.’ 
\p
\v 20  \wj ‘Foxes \+w have\+w* \+w holes\+w*,’\wj* answered Jesus, \wj ‘\+w and\+w* \+w wild\+w* \+w birds\+w* \+w their\+w* \+w nests\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Son\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Man\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w nowhere\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w lay\+w* \+w his\+w* \+w head\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 21 ‘Master,’ said another, who was a disciple, ‘let me first go and bury my father.’ 
\v 22 But Jesus answered, \wj ‘\+w Follow\+w* \+w me\+w*, \+w and\+w* leave \+w the\+w* \+w dead\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w bury\+w* \+w their\+w* \+w dead\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 23 Then he got into the boat, followed by his disciples. 
\v 24 Suddenly so great a storm came up on the sea, that the waves broke right over the boat. But Jesus was asleep; 
\v 25 and the disciples came and roused him. ‘Master,’ they cried, ‘save us; we are lost!’ 
\p
\v 26  \wj ‘\+w Why\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w so\+w* timid?’\wj* he said. \wj ‘\+w You\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w little\+w* \+w faith\+w*!’\wj* Then Jesus rose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and a great calm followed. 
\v 27 The men were amazed, and exclaimed, ‘What kind of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!’ 
\p
\v 28 On getting to the other side – the region of the Gadarenes – Jesus met two men who were possessed by demons, coming out of the tombs. They were so violent that no one was able to pass that way. 
\v 29 Suddenly they shrieked out, ‘What do you want with us, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before our time?’ 
\v 30 A long way off, there was a herd of many pigs, feeding; 
\v 31 and the foul spirits began begging Jesus, ‘If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs.’ 
\p
\v 32  \wj ‘\+w Go\+w*,’\wj* he said. The spirits came out, and entered the pigs; and the whole herd rushed down the steep slope into the sea, and died in the water. 
\v 33 At this the men who tended them ran away and went to the town, carrying the news of all that had occurred, and of what had happened to the possessed men. 
\v 34 At the news the whole town went out to meet Jesus, and, when they saw him, they entreated him to go away from their region. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 Afterwards Jesus got into a boat, and, crossing over, came to his own city. 
\v 2 There some people brought to him a paralysed man on a bed. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the man, \wj ‘\+w Courage\+w*, \+w child\+w*! \+w Your\+w* sins \+w are\+w* forgiven.’\wj* 
\v 3 Then some of the teachers of the Law said to themselves, ‘This man is blaspheming!’ 
\v 4 Knowing their thoughts, Jesus exclaimed, \wj ‘\+w Why\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w your\+w* cherish \+w such\+w* \+w wicked\+w* \+w thoughts\+w*?\wj* 
\v 5  \wj \+w Which\+w*, \+w I\+w* \+w ask\+w*, \+w is\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w easier\+w*? – \+w to\+w* \+w say\+w* “\+w Your\+w* sins \+w are\+w* forgiven”? \+w Or\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w say\+w* “\+w Get\+w* \+w up\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w walk\+w*”?\wj* 
\v 6  \wj \+w But\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w show\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Son\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Man\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w power\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w earth\+w* \+w to\+w* forgive sins’\wj* – then he said to the paralysed man – \wj ‘\+w Get\+w* \+w up\+w*, \+w take\+w* \+w up\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w bed\+w*, \+w and\+w* return \+w to\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w home\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 7 The man got up and went to his home. 
\v 8 When the crowd saw this, they were awe-struck, and praised God for giving such power to human beings. 
\p
\v 9 As Jesus went along, he saw a man, called Matthew, sitting in the tax office, and said to him, \wj ‘Follow \+w me\+w*.’\wj* Matthew got up and followed him. 
\p
\v 10 And, later on, when he was having dinner in the house, a number of tax collectors and outcasts came in and took their places at the table with Jesus and his disciples. 
\v 11 When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, ‘Why does your teacher eat in the company of tax collectors and outcasts?’ 
\v 12 On hearing this, Jesus said, \wj ‘\+w It\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w those\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w healthy\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w need\+w* \+w a\+w* doctor, \+w but\+w* \+w those\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w ill\+w*.\wj* 
\v 13  \wj \+w Go\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w learn\+w* \+w what\+w* \+w this\+w* \+w means\+w* – “\+w I\+w* \+w desire\+w* \+w mercy\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w sacrifice\+w*”; \+w for\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w did\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w come\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w call\+w* \+w the\+w* religious, \+w but\+w* \+w the\+w* outcast.’\wj* 
\v 14 Then John’s disciples came to Jesus, and asked, ‘Why do we and the Pharisees fast while your disciples do not?’ 
\v 15 Jesus answered, \wj ‘\+w Can\+w* \+w the\+w* groom’s friends \+w mourn\+w* \+w as\+w* \+w long\+w* \+w as\+w* \+w the\+w* groom \+w is\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w them\+w*? \+w But\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w days\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w come\+w*, \+w when\+w* \+w the\+w* groom \+w will\+w* \+w be\+w* taken \+w away\+w* \+w from\+w* \+w them\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w they\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w fast\+w* \+w then\+w*.\wj* 
\v 16  \wj \+w Nobody\+w* \+w ever\+w* \+w puts\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w piece\+w* \+w of\+w* unshrunk \+w cloth\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w an\+w* \+w old\+w* \+w garment\+w*; \+w for\+w* \+w such\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w patch\+w* tears away \+w from\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w garment\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w worse\+w* \+w tear\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w made\+w*.\wj*

\p
\v 18 While Jesus was saying this, a synagogue leader came up and bowed to the ground before him. ‘My daughter,’ he said, ‘has just died; but come and place your hand on her, and she will be restored to life.’ 
\v 19 So Jesus rose and followed him, and his disciples went also. 
\v 20 But meanwhile a woman, who had been suffering from haemorrhage for twelve years, came up behind and touched the tassel of his cloak. 
\v 21 ‘If I only touch his cloak,’ she said to herself, ‘I will get well.’ 
\v 22 Turning and seeing her, Jesus said, \wj ‘\+w Courage\+w*, \+w daughter\+w*! \+w Your\+w* \+w faith\+w* \+w has\+w* delivered \+w you\+w*.’\wj* And at that very moment she became well. 
\v 23 When Jesus reached the leader’s house, seeing the flute players, and a number of people all in confusion, 
\v 24 he said, \wj ‘\+w Go\+w* away, \+w the\+w* \+w little\+w* \+w girl\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w not\+w* dead; \+w she\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w asleep\+w*.’\wj* They began to laugh at him; 
\v 25 but, when the people had been sent out, Jesus went in, and took the little girl’s hand, and she rose. 
\v 26 The report of this spread through all that part of the country. 
\p
\v 27 As Jesus was passing on from there, he was followed by two blind men, who kept calling out, ‘Take pity on us, Son of David!’ 
\v 28 When he had gone indoors, the blind men came up to him; and Jesus asked them, \wj ‘\+w Do\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w believe\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w am\+w* \+w able\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w this\+w*?’\wj* ‘Yes, Master!’ they answered. 
\v 29 Then he touched their eyes, and said, \wj ‘\+w It\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w according\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w faith\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 30 Then their eyes were opened. Jesus sternly cautioned them. \wj ‘\+w See\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w no\+w* \+w one\+w* \+w knows\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w it\+w*,’\wj* he said. 
\v 31 But the men went out, and spread the news about him through all that part of the country. 
\v 32 Just as they were going out, some people brought up to Jesus a dumb man who was possessed by a demon; 
\v 33 and, as soon as the demon had been driven out, the dumb man spoke. The people were astonished at this, and exclaimed, ‘Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel!’ 
\v 34 But the Pharisees said, ‘He drives out the demons by the help of the chief of the demons.’ 
\p
\v 35 Jesus went round all the towns and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and curing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness. 
\v 36 But, when he saw the crowds, his heart was moved with compassion for them, because they were distressed and harassed, like sheep without a shepherd; 
\v 37 and he said to his disciples, \wj ‘\+w The\+w* \+w harvest\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w abundant\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w labourers\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w few\+w*.\wj*

\c 10  
\p
\v 1 Calling his twelve Disciples to him, Jesus gave them authority over foul spirits, so that they could drive them out, as well as the power of curing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness. 
\v 2 The names of the twelve apostles are these, First Simon, also known as Peter, and his brother Andrew; James the son of Zebedee, and his brother John; 
\v 3 Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax-gather; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; 
\v 4 Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot – the apostle who betrayed him. 
\p
\v 5 These twelve Jesus sent out as his messengers, after giving them these instructions – \wj ‘\+w Do\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w go\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Gentiles\+w*, \+w nor\+w* \+w enter\+w* \+w any\+w* \+w Samaritan\+w* \+w town\+w*,\wj*

\v 1 About the same time Jesus walked through the cornfields one Sabbath. His disciples were hungry, and began to pick some ears of wheat and eat them. 
\v 2 But, when the Pharisees saw this, they said, ‘Look! Your disciples are doing what it is not allowable to do on a Sabbath!’ 
\p

\p
\v 9 Passing on, Jesus went into their synagogue, 
\v 10 and there he saw a man with a withered hand. Some people asked Jesus whether it was allowable to work a cure on the Sabbath – so that they might have a charge to bring against him. 
\v 11 But Jesus said to them, \wj ‘\+w Which\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w you\+w*, \+w if\+w* \+w he\+w* \+w had\+w* \+w only\+w* \+w one\+w* \+w sheep\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w sheep\+w* \+w fell\+w* \+w into\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w pit\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Sabbath\+w*, \+w would\+w* \+w not\+w* lay \+w hold\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w and\+w* pull \+w it\+w* \+w out\+w*?\wj*

\v 13 Then he said to the man. \wj ‘\+w Stretch\+w* \+w out\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w hand\+w*.’\wj* The man stretched it out; and it had become as sound as the other. 
\v 14 On coming out, the Pharisees plotted against Jesus, to put him to death. 
\p
\v 15 Jesus, however, became aware of it, and went away from that place. A number of people followed him, and he cured them all; 
\v 16 but he warned them not to make him known, 
\v 17 in fulfilment of these words in the prophet Isaiah – 
\v 18 “Here is my chosen servant, who I love and who pleases me! I will breathe my spirit on him, and he will announce a time of judgment to the Gentiles. 
\v 19 He will not contend, nor cry aloud, Neither will anyone hear his voice in the streets; 
\v 20 a bruised reed he will not break, and a smouldering wick he will not quench, until he has brought the judgment to a victorious issue, 
\v 21 and on his name will the Gentiles rest their hopes.” 
\p
\v 22 Then some people brought to Jesus a possessed man, who was blind and dumb; and he cured him, so that the man who had been dumb both talked and saw. 
\v 23 At this all the people were astounded. ‘Is it possible that this is the son of David?’ they exclaimed. 
\v 24 But the Pharisees heard of it and said, ‘He drives out demons only by the help of Beelzebul the chief of the demons.’ 
\v 25 Jesus, however, was aware of what was passing in their minds, and said to them, \wj ‘\+w Any\+w* kingdom \+w divided\+w* \+w against\+w* \+w itself\+w* becomes \+w a\+w* desolation, \+w and\+w* \+w any\+w* \+w town\+w* \+w or\+w* \+w household\+w* \+w divided\+w* \+w against\+w* \+w itself\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w not\+w* last.\wj*

\p
\v 51  \wj ‘\+w Have\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w understood\+w* \+w all\+w* \+w this\+w*?’\wj* Jesus asked. ‘Yes,’ they answered. 
\v 52 Then he added, \wj ‘\+w So\+w* \+w every\+w* teacher \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* Law, \+w who\+w* \+w has\+w* received instruction \+w about\+w* \+w the\+w* kingdom \+w of\+w* \+w heaven\+w*, \+w is\+w* \+w like\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w householder\+w* \+w who\+w* produces \+w from\+w* \+w his\+w* stores \+w things\+w* \+w both\+w* \+w new\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w old\+w*.’\wj* 
\p
\v 53 When Jesus had finished these parables, he withdrew from that place. 
\v 54 Going to his own part of the country, he taught the people in their synagogue in such a manner that they were deeply impressed. ‘Where did he get this wisdom?’ they said, ‘and the miracles? 
\v 55 Isn’t he the carpenter’s son? Isn’t his mother called Mary, and his brothers James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Judas? 
\v 56 And his sisters, too – are not they all living among us? Where, then did he get all this?’ 
\v 57 These things proved a hindrance to their believing in him. But Jesus said, \wj ‘\+w A\+w* \+w prophet\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w without\+w* honour, \+w except\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w his\+w* \+w own\+w* \+w country\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w his\+w* \+w own\+w* \+w house\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 58 He did not work many miracles there, because of their want of faith. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1 At that time Prince Herod heard of the fame of Jesus, 
\v 2 and said to his attendants, ‘This must be John the Baptist; he must be risen from the dead, and that is why these miraculous powers are active in him.’ 
\v 3 For Herod had arrested John, put him in chains, and shut him up in prison, to please Herodias, the wife of Herod’s brother Philip. 
\v 4 For John had said to him “You have no right to be living with her.” 
\v 5 Yet, though Herod wanted to put him to death, he was afraid of the people, because they looked on John as a prophet. 
\v 6 But, when Herod’s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before his guests, and so pleased Herod, 
\v 7 that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked. 
\v 8 Prompted by her mother, the girl said “Give me here, on a dish, the head of John the Baptist.” 
\v 9 The king was distressed at this; yet, because of his oath and of the guests at his table, he ordered it to be given her. 
\v 10 He had John beheaded in the prison 
\v 11 and his head was brought on a dish and given to the girl, and she took it to her mother. 
\v 12 Then John’s disciples came, and took the body away, and buried it; and went and told Jesus. 
\p
\v 13 When Jesus heard of it, he left privately in a boat to a lonely spot. The people, however, heard of his going, and followed him in crowds from the towns on foot. 
\v 14 On getting out of the boat, Jesus saw a great crowd, and his heart was moved at the sight of them; and he cured all the sick among them. 
\v 15 In the evening the disciples came up to him, and said, ‘This is a lonely spot, and the day is now far advanced; send the crowds away so that they can go to the villages, and buy themselves food.’ 
\v 16 But Jesus said, \wj ‘\+w They\+w* \+w need\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w go\+w* away, \+w it\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w give\+w* \+w them\+w* something \+w to\+w* \+w eat\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 17 ‘We have nothing here,’ they said, ‘except five loaves and two fish.’ 
\p
\v 18  \wj ‘\+w Bring\+w* \+w them\+w* \+w here\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w me\+w*,’\wj* was his reply. 
\v 19 Jesus ordered the people to take their seats on the grass; and, taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven, and said the blessing, and, after he had broken the loaves, gave them to his disciples; and they gave them to the crowds. 
\v 20 Everyone had sufficient to eat, and they picked up enough of the broken pieces that were left to fill twelve baskets. 
\v 21 The men who ate were about five thousand in number, without counting women and children. 
\v 22 Immediately afterwards Jesus made the disciples get into a boat and cross over in advance of him, while he dismissed the crowds. 
\v 23 After dismissing the crowds, he went up the hill by himself to pray; and, when evening fell, he was there alone. 
\v 24 The boat was by this time some miles from shore, labouring in the waves, for the wind was against her. 
\v 25 Three hours after midnight, however, Jesus came towards the disciples, walking on the water. 
\v 26 But, when they saw him walking on the water, they were terrified. ‘It is a ghost,’ they exclaimed, and cried out in fear. 
\v 27 But Jesus at once spoke to them. \wj ‘\+w Courage\+w*!’\wj* he said, \wj ‘\+w It\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w I\+w*; \+w do\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w afraid\+w*!’\wj* 
\v 28 ‘Master,’ Peter exclaimed, ‘if it is you, tell me to come to you on the water.’ 
\v 29 Jesus said, \wj ‘\+w Come\+w*.’\wj* So Peter got down from the boat, and walked on the water, and went towards Jesus; 
\v 30 but, when he felt the wind, he was frightened, and, beginning to sink, cried out, ‘Master! Save me!’ 
\v 31 Instantly Jesus stretched out his hand, and caught hold of him. \wj ‘\+w You\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w little\+w* \+w faith\+w*!’\wj* he said, \wj ‘\+w Why\+w* \+w did\+w* \+w you\+w* falter?’\wj* 
\v 32 When they had got into the boat, the wind dropped. 
\v 33 But the men in the boat threw themselves on their faces before him, and said, ‘You are indeed God’s Son.’ 
\p
\v 34 When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret. 
\v 35 But the people of that place, recognising Jesus, sent out to the whole country round, and brought to him all who were ill, 
\v 36 begging him merely to let them touch the tassel of his cloak; and all who touched were made perfectly well. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1 Then some Pharisees and teachers of the Law came to Jesus, and said, 
\v 2 ‘How is it that your disciples break the traditions of our ancestors? For they do not wash their hands when they eat food.’ 
\v 3 His reply was, \wj ‘\+w How\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w your\+w* side \+w break\+w* \+w God\+w*’s \+w commandments\+w* \+w out\+w* \+w of\+w* respect \+w for\+w* \+w your\+w* own \+w traditions\+w*?\wj*

\v 10 Then Jesus called the people to him, and said, \wj ‘Listen, \+w and\+w* mark \+w my\+w* \+w words\+w*.\wj* 
\v 11  \wj \+w It\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w what\+w* \+w enters\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w person\+w*’s \+w mouth\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w defiles\+w* \+w them\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w what\+w* \+w comes\+w* \+w out\+w* \+w from\+w* \+w their\+w* \+w mouth\+w* – \+w that\+w* does \+w defile\+w* \+w them\+w*!’\wj* 
\v 12 His disciples came up to him, and said, ‘Do you know that the Pharisees were shocked on hearing what you said?’ 
\p
\v 13  \wj ‘\+w Every\+w* \+w plant\+w*,’\wj* Jesus replied, \wj ‘\+w that\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w heavenly\+w* \+w Father\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w planted\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w be\+w* rooted up.\wj*

\v 15 Peter spoke up, ‘Explain this saying to us.’ 
\p
\v 16  \wj ‘\+w What\+w*, \+w do\+w* \+w even\+w* \+w you\+w* understand nothing \+w yet\+w*?’\wj* Jesus exclaimed. 
\v 17  \wj ‘Don’\+w t\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w see\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w whatever\+w* \+w goes\+w* \+w into\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w mouth\+w* \+w passes\+w* \+w into\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w stomach\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w is\+w* afterwards \+w expelled\+w*?\wj*

\p
\v 21 On going away from that place, Jesus went to the country round Tyre and Sidon. 
\v 22 There, a Canaanite woman of that district came out and began calling to Jesus, ‘Take pity on me, Master, Son of David; my daughter is grievously possessed by a demon.’ 
\v 23 But Jesus did not answer her a word; and his disciples came up and begged him to send her away. ‘She keeps calling out after us,’ they said. 
\v 24  \wj ‘\+w I\+w* \+w was\+w* \+w not\+w* sent,’\wj* replied Jesus, \wj ‘\+w to\+w* anyone \+w except\+w* \+w the\+w* lost \+w sheep\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Israel\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 25 But the woman came, and, bowing to the ground before him, said, ‘Master, help me.’ 
\p
\v 26  \wj ‘\+w It\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w fair\+w*,’\wj* replied Jesus, \wj ‘\+w to\+w* \+w take\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w children\+w*’s food \+w and\+w* throw \+w it\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w dogs\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 27 ‘Yes, Master,’ she said, ‘for even dogs do feed on the scraps that fall from their owners’ table.’ 
\p
\v 28  \wj ‘\+w Your\+w* \+w faith\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w great\+w*,’\wj* was his reply to the woman, \wj ‘\+w it\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w as\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w wish\+w*!’\wj* And her daughter was cured that very hour. 
\p
\v 29 On leaving that place, Jesus went to the shore of the Sea of Galilee; and then went up the hill, and sat down. 
\v 30 Great crowds of people came to him, bringing with them those who were lame, crippled, blind, or dumb, and many others. They put them down at his feet, and he cured them; 
\v 31 and the crowds were astonished, when they saw the dumb talking, the cripples made sound, the lame walking about, and the blind with their sight restored; and they praised the God of Israel. 
\v 32 Afterwards Jesus called his disciples to him, and said, \wj ‘\+w My\+w* heart \+w is\+w* \+w moved\+w* \+w at\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w sight\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w all\+w* \+w these\+w* \+w people\+w*, \+w for\+w* \+w they\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w already\+w* \+w been\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w three\+w* \+w days\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w they\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w nothing\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w eat\+w*; \+w and\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w am\+w* \+w unwilling\+w* \+w to\+w* send \+w them\+w* away \+w hungry\+w*; \+w they\+w* \+w might\+w* \+w faint\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w way\+w* \+w home\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 33 ‘Where can we,’ his disciples asked, ‘in a lonely place find enough bread for such a crowd as this?’ 
\p
\v 34  \wj ‘\+w How\+w* \+w many\+w* loaves \+w have\+w* \+w you\+w*?’\wj* said Jesus. ‘Seven,’ they answered, ‘and a few small fish.’ 
\v 35 Telling the crowd to sit down on the ground, 
\v 36 Jesus took the seven loaves and the fish, and, after saying the thanksgiving, broke them, and gave them to the disciples; and the disciples gave them to the crowds. 
\v 37 Everyone had sufficient to eat, and they picked up seven baskets full of the broken pieces left. 
\v 38 The men who ate were four thousand in number without counting women and children. 
\v 39 Then, after dismissing the crowds, Jesus got into the boat, and went to the region of Magadan. 
\c 16  
\p
\v 1 Here the Pharisees and Sadducees came up, and, to test Jesus, requested him to show them some sign from the heavens. 
\v 2 But Jesus answered, \wj ‘\+w In\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w evening\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w say\+w* “\+w It\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w be\+w* fine \+w weather\+w*, \+w for\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w sky\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w as\+w* \+w red\+w* \+w as\+w* fire.”\wj* 
\v 3  \wj \+w But\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w morning\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w say\+w* “\+w Today\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w be\+w* stormy, \+w for\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w sky\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w as\+w* \+w red\+w* \+w as\+w* fire \+w and\+w* \+w threatening\+w*.” \+w You\+w* \+w learn\+w* \+w to\+w* read \+w the\+w* \+w sky\+w*; \+w yet\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w unable\+w* \+w to\+w* read \+w the\+w* \+w signs\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w times\+w*!\wj*

\p
\v 5 Now the disciples had crossed to the opposite shore, and had forgotten to take any bread. 
\v 6 Presently Jesus said to them, ‘Take care and be on your guard against the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.’ 
\v 7 But the disciples began talking among themselves about their having brought no bread. 
\v 8 On noticing this, Jesus said, \wj ‘\+w Why\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w talking\+w* \+w among\+w* \+w yourselves\+w* \+w about\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w being\+w* \+w short\+w* \+w of\+w* bread, \+w you\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w little\+w* \+w faith\+w*?\wj*

\v 10  \wj \+w Nor\+w* \+w yet\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w seven\+w* loaves \+w for\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w four\+w* \+w thousand\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w how\+w* \+w many\+w* basketfuls \+w you\+w* \+w took\+w* away?\wj* 
\v 11  \wj \+w How\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w see\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w was\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w speaking\+w* \+w about\+w* bread? \+w Be\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w guard\+w* \+w against\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w leaven\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Pharisees\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w Sadducees\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 12 Then they understood that he had told them to be on their guard, not against the leaven of bread, but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. 
\p
\v 13 On coming into the region of Caesarea Philippi, Jesus asked his disciples this question – \wj ‘\+w Who\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w people\+w* \+w say\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Son\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Man\+w* \+w is\+w*?’\wj* 
\v 14 ‘Some say John the Baptist,’ they answered, ‘Others, however, say that he is Elijah, while others again say Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.’ 
\p
\v 15  \wj ‘\+w But\+w* \+w you\+w*,’\wj* he said, \wj ‘\+w who\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w say\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w am\+w*?’\wj* 
\v 16 To this Simon Peter answered, ‘You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.’ 
\p
\v 17  \wj ‘\+w Blessed\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w you\+w*, \+w Simon\+w*, Son \+w of\+w* Jonah,’\wj* Jesus replied. \wj ‘\+w For\+w* \+w no\+w* \+w human\+w* \+w being\+w* \+w has\+w* revealed \+w this\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w you\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w Father\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w heaven\+w*.\wj*

\v 20 Then he charged his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ. 
\p
\v 21 At that time Jesus Christ began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem, and undergo much suffering at the hands of the elders, and chief priests, and teachers of the Law, and be put to death, and rise on the third day. 
\v 22 But Peter took Jesus aside, and began to rebuke him. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘please God that will never be your fate!’ 
\v 23 Jesus, however, turning to Peter, said, \wj ‘\+w Out\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w way\+w*, \+w Satan\+w*! \+w You\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w a\+w* hindrance \+w to\+w* \+w me\+w*; \+w for\+w* \+w you\+w* look \+w at\+w* \+w things\+w*, \+w not\+w* \+w as\+w* \+w God\+w* \+w does\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w as\+w* person \+w does\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 24 Then Jesus said to his disciples, \wj ‘\+w If\+w* \+w anyone\+w* \+w wishes\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w walk\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w my\+w* steps, \+w they\+w* \+w must\+w* renounce self, \+w and\+w* \+w take\+w* \+w up\+w* \+w their\+w* \+w cross\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w follow\+w* \+w me\+w*.\wj*

\c 17  
\p
\v 1 Six days later, Jesus took with him Peter, and the brothers James and John, and led them up a high mountain alone. 
\v 2 There his appearance was transformed before their eyes; his face shown like the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light. 
\v 3 All at once Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Jesus. 
\v 4 ‘Master,’ exclaimed Peter, interposing, ‘it is good to be here; if you wish, I will make three tents here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.’ 
\v 5 While he was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them, and there was a voice from the cloud that said – ‘This is my dearly loved son, who brings me great joy; listen to him.’ 
\v 6 The disciples, on hearing this, fell on their faces, greatly afraid. 
\v 7 But Jesus came and touched them, saying as he did so, \wj ‘\+w Rise\+w* \+w up\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w afraid\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 8 When they raised their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus himself alone. 
\v 9 As they were going down the mountain side, Jesus gave them this warning – \wj ‘\+w Do\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w speak\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w this\+w* \+w vision\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w anyone\+w*, \+w until\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Son\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Man\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w risen\+w* \+w from\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w dead\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 10 ‘How is it,’ his disciples asked, ‘that our teachers of the Law say that Elijah has to come first?’ 
\p
\v 11  \wj ‘\+w Elijah\+w* \+w indeed\+w* \+w does\+w* \+w come\+w*,’\wj* Jesus replied, \wj ‘\+w and\+w* \+w will\+w* restore \+w everything\+w*;\wj* 
\v 12  \wj \+w and\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w Elijah\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w already\+w* \+w come\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w people\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w not\+w* recognised \+w him\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w treated\+w* \+w him\+w* \+w just\+w* \+w as\+w* \+w they\+w* pleased. \+w In\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w same\+w* \+w way\+w*, \+w too\+w*, \+w the\+w* \+w Son\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Man\+w* \+w is\+w* destined \+w to\+w* undergo \+w suffering\+w* \+w at\+w* \+w people\+w*’s \+w hands\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 13 Then the disciples understood that he had spoken to them about John the Baptist. 
\p
\v 14 When they came to the crowd, a man came up to Jesus, and, kneeling down before him, said, 
\v 15 ‘Master, take pity on my son, for he is epileptic and suffers terribly; indeed, he often falls into the fire and into the water; 
\v 16 I brought him to your disciples, but they could not cure him.’ 
\p
\v 17  \wj ‘Faithless \+w and\+w* \+w perverse\+w* \+w generation\+w*!’\wj* Jesus exclaimed, \wj ‘\+w how\+w* \+w long\+w* \+w must\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w among\+w* \+w you\+w*? \+w How\+w* \+w long\+w* \+w must\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w have\+w* patience \+w with\+w* \+w you\+w*? \+w Bring\+w* \+w the\+w* boy \+w here\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w me\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 18 Then Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of the boy; and he was cured from that very hour. 
\v 19 Afterwards the disciples came up to Jesus, and asked him privately, ‘Why was it that we could not drive it out?’ 
\p
\v 20  \wj ‘\+w Because\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w so\+w* \+w little\+w* \+w faith\+w*!’\wj* he answered, \wj ‘\+w For\+w*, \+w I\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w*, \+w if\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w faith\+w* \+w were\+w* \+w only\+w* \+w like\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w mustard\+w* \+w seed\+w*, \+w you\+w* \+w could\+w* \+w say\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w this\+w* \+w mountain\+w* “\+w Move\+w* \+w from\+w* \+w this\+w* \+w place\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w that\+w*!” \+w and\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w would\+w* \+w be\+w* moved; \+w and\+w* \+w nothing\+w* \+w would\+w* \+w be\+w* impossible \+w to\+w* \+w you\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 21  \f + \fr 17.21  \ft Some later manuscripts add: But this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.\f* 
\p
\v 22 While Jesus and his disciples were together in Galilee, he said to them, \wj ‘\+w The\+w* \+w Son\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Man\+w* \+w is\+w* destined \+w to\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w betrayed\+w* \+w into\+w* human \+w hands\+w*,\wj*

\p
\v 24 After they had reached Capernaum, the collectors of the Temple taz came up to Peter, and said, ‘Does not your Master pay the Temple tax?’ 
\p
\v 25 ‘Yes,’ answered Peter. But, on going into the house, before he could speak, Jesus said, \wj ‘\+w What\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w think\+w*, \+w Simon\+w*? \+w From\+w* \+w whom\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w earthly\+w* \+w kings\+w* \+w take\+w* \+w taxes\+w* \+w or\+w* \+w tribute\+w*? \+w From\+w* \+w their\+w* \+w sons\+w*, \+w or\+w* \+w from\+w* \+w others\+w*?’\wj* 
\v 26 ‘From others,’ answered Peter. \wj ‘\+w Well\+w* \+w then\+w*,’\wj* continued Jesus, \wj ‘\+w their\+w* \+w sons\+w* go \+w free\+w*.\wj* 
\v 27  \wj Still, \+w so\+w* \+w we\+w* don’\+w t\+w* \+w offend\+w* \+w them\+w*, \+w go\+w* \+w and\+w* throw \+w a\+w* line \+w into\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w sea\+w*; \+w take\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w first\+w* \+w fish\+w* \+w that\+w* rises, open \+w its\+w* \+w mouth\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w find\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w a\+w* piece \+w of\+w* money. \+w Take\+w* \+w that\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w give\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w the\+w* collectors \+w for\+w* \+w both\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w us\+w*.’\wj*

\v 1 On the same occasion the disciples came to Jesus, and asked him, ‘Who is really the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?’ 
\v 2 Jesus called a little child to him, and placed it in the middle of them, and then said,

\s1 The Journey to Jerusalem 
\p
\v 1 At the conclusion of this teaching, Jesus withdrew from Galilee, and went into that district of Judea which is on the other side of the Jordan. 
\v 2 Great crowds followed him, and he cured them there. 
\v 3 Presently some Pharisees came up to him, and, to test him, said, ‘Has a man the right to divorce his wife for every cause?’ 
\p
\v 4  \wj ‘Haven’\+w t\+w* \+w you\+w* read,’\wj* replied Jesus, \wj ‘\+w that\+w* \+w at\+w* \+w the\+w* beginning \+w the\+w* \+w Creator\+w* “\+w made\+w* \+w them\+w* male \+w and\+w* \+w female\+w*,”\wj* 
\v 5  \wj \+w and\+w* \+w said\+w* – “\+w For\+w* \+w this\+w* \+w reason\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w man\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w leave\+w* \+w his\+w* \+w father\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w mother\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w be\+w* united \+w to\+w* \+w his\+w* \+w wife\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w man\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w his\+w* \+w wife\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w become\+w* \+w one\+w*”?\wj* 
\v 6  \wj \+w So\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w they\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w no\+w* \+w longer\+w* \+w two\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w one\+w*. \+w What\+w* \+w God\+w* himself, \+w then\+w*, \+w has\+w* yoked \+w together\+w* \+w people\+w* \+w must\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w separate\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 7 ‘Why, then,’ they said, ‘did Moses direct that a man should serve his wife with a notice of separation and divorce her?’ 
\p
\v 8  \wj ‘\+w Moses\+w*, owing \+w to\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w hardness\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w hearts\+w*,’\wj* answered Jesus, \wj ‘\+w permitted\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w to\+w* divorce \+w your\+w* \+w wives\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w was\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w so\+w* \+w at\+w* \+w the\+w* beginning.\wj*

\v 10 ‘If that,’ said the disciples, ‘is the position of a man with regard to his wife, it is better not to marry.’ 
\p
\v 11  \wj ‘\+w It\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w everyone\+w*,’\wj* replied Jesus, \wj ‘\+w who\+w* \+w can\+w* \+w accept\+w* \+w this\+w* \+w teaching\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w only\+w* \+w those\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w been\+w* \+w enabled\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w so\+w*.\wj*

\p
\v 13 Then some little children were brought to Jesus, for him to place his hands on them, and pray; but the disciples found fault with those who had brought them. 
\v 14 Jesus, however, said, \wj ‘\+w Let\+w* \+w the\+w* little \+w children\+w* \+w come\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w me\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w hinder\+w* \+w them\+w*, \+w for\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w the\+w* childlike \+w that\+w* \+w the\+w* kingdom \+w of\+w* \+w heaven\+w* \+w belongs\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 15 So he placed his hands on them, and then went on his way. 
\p
\v 16 A man came up to Jesus, and said, ‘Teacher, what good thing must I do to obtain eternal life?’ 
\p
\v 17  \wj ‘\+w Why\+w* \+w ask\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w about\+w* goodness?’\wj* answered Jesus. \wj ‘\+w There\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w but\+w* \+w One\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w good\+w*. \+w If\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w want\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w enter\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w life\+w*, \+w keep\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w commandments\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 18 ‘What commandments?’ asked the man. \wj ‘\+w These\+w*,’\wj* answered Jesus, – \wj ‘“\+w You\+w* \+w must\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w kill\+w*. \+w You\+w* \+w must\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w commit\+w* \+w adultery\+w*. \+w You\+w* \+w must\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w steal\+w*. \+w You\+w* \+w must\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w say\+w* \+w what\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w false\+w* \+w about\+w* \+w others\+w*.\wj*

\v 20 ‘I have observed all these,’ said the young man. ‘What is still wanting in me?’ 
\p
\v 21  \wj ‘\+w If\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w wish\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w perfect\+w*,’\wj* answered Jesus, \wj ‘\+w go\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w sell\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w property\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w give\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w poor\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w have\+w* wealth \+w in\+w* \+w heaven\+w*; \+w then\+w* \+w come\+w* \+w and\+w* follow \+w me\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 22 On hearing these words, the young man went away distressed, for he had great possessions. 
\v 23 At this, Jesus said to his disciples, \wj ‘\+w I\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w rich\+w* person \+w will\+w* find \+w it\+w* \+w hard\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w enter\+w* \+w the\+w* kingdom \+w of\+w* \+w heaven\+w*!\wj*

\v 25 On hearing this, the disciples exclaimed in great astonishment, ‘Who then can possibly be saved?’ 
\v 26 But Jesus looked at them, and said, \wj ‘\+w With\+w* \+w people\+w* \+w this\+w* \+w is\+w* impossible, \+w but\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w God\+w* \+w everything\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w possible\+w*.’\wj* Then Peter turned and said to Jesus, 
\v 27 ‘But we – we left everything, and followed you; what, then, will we have?’

\v 20 Then the mother of Zebedee’s sons came to him with her sons, bowing to the ground, and begging a favour. 
\v 21  \wj ‘\+w What\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w want\+w*?’\wj* he asked. ‘I want you to say,’ she replied, ‘that in your kingdom these two sons of mine may sit, one on your right, and the other on your left.’ 
\p
\v 22  \wj ‘\+w You\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w know\+w* \+w what\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w asking\+w*,’\wj* was Jesus’ answer. \wj ‘\+w Can\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w drink\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w cup\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w am\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w drink\+w*?’\wj* ‘Yes,’ they exclaimed, ‘we can.’

\v 23  \wj ‘\+w You\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w indeed\+w* \+w drink\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w cup\+w*,’\wj* he said, \wj ‘\+w but\+w* \+w as\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w seat\+w* \+w at\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w right\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w at\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w left\+w* – \+w that\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w mine\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w give\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w those\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w whom\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w been\+w* \+w prepared\+w* \+w by\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w Father\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 24 On hearing of this, the ten others were very indignant about the two brothers.

\p
\v 29 As they were going out of Jericho, a great crowd followed him. 
\v 30 Two blind men who were sitting by the roadside, hearing that Jesus was passing, called out, ‘Take pity on us, Master, Son of David!’ 
\v 31 The crowd told them to be quiet; but the men only called out the louder, ‘Take pity on us, Master, Son of David!’ 
\v 32 Then Jesus stopped and called them. \wj ‘\+w What\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w want\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w you\+w*?’\wj* he said. 
\v 33 ‘Master,’ they replied, ‘we want our eyes to be opened.’ 
\v 34 So Jesus, moved with compassion, touched their eyes, and immediately they recovered their sight, and followed him.

\s1 The Last Days 
\p
\v 1 When they had almost reached Jerusalem, having come as far as Bethphage, on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent on two disciples. 
\v 2  \wj ‘\+w Go\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w village\+w* facing \+w you\+w*,’\wj* he said, \wj ‘\+w and\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w immediately\+w* \+w find\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w donkey\+w* tethered, \+w with\+w* \+w a\+w* foal \+w by\+w* \+w her\+w* side; \+w untie\+w* \+w her\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w lead\+w* \+w her\+w* \+w here\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w me\+w*.\wj* 
\v 3  \wj \+w And\+w*, \+w if\+w* \+w anyone\+w* \+w says\+w* \+w anything\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w you\+w*, \+w you\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w say\+w* \+w this\+w* – “\+w The\+w* \+w Master\+w* \+w wants\+w* \+w them\+w*”; \+w and\+w* \+w he\+w* \+w will\+w* send \+w them\+w* \+w at\+w* once.’\wj* 
\v 4 This happened in fulfilment of these words in the prophet – 
\v 5 “Say to the people of Zion – ‘Your King is coming to you, gentle, and riding on a donkey, and on the foal of a beast of burden.’” 
\p
\v 6 So the disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them. 
\v 7 They led the donkey and the foal back, and, when they had put their cloaks on them, he seated himself on them. 
\v 8 The immense crowd of people spread their cloaks in the road, while some cut branches off the trees, and spread them on the road. 
\v 9 The crowds that led the way, as well as those that followed behind, kept shouting, ‘God save the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! God save him from on high!’ 
\v 10 When he had entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred, and asked – 
\v 11 ‘Who is this?’, to which the crowd replied – ‘This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth in Galilee.’ 
\p
\v 12 Jesus went into the Temple Courts, and drove out all those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers, and the seats of the pigeon-dealers, 
\v 13 and said to them, \wj ‘\+w Scripture\+w* \+w says\+w* “\+w My\+w* \+w house\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w called\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w house\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w prayer\+w*”; \+w but\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w making\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w den\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w robbers\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 14 While he was still in the Temple Courts, some blind and some lame people came up to him, and he cured them. 
\v 15 But, when the chief priests and the teachers of the Law saw the wonderful things that Jesus did, and the boys who were calling out in the Temple Courts ‘God save the Son of David!’, they were indignant, 
\v 16 and said to him, ‘Do you hear what these boys are saying?’ 
\p \wj ‘\+w Yes\+w*,’\wj* answered Jesus, \wj ‘\+w but\+w* \+w did\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w never\+w* read \+w the\+w* \+w words\+w* – “\+w Out\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w mouths\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w babes\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w sucklings\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w called\+w* \+w forth\+w* \+w perfect\+w* praise”?’\wj* 
\p
\v 17 Then he left them, and went out of the city to Bethany, and spent the night there. 
\p
\v 18 The next morning, in returning to the city, Jesus became hungry; 
\v 19 and, noticing a solitary fig tree by the roadside, he went up to it, but found nothing on it but leaves. So he said to it, \wj ‘\+w Never\+w* \+w again\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w fruit\+w* \+w be\+w* gathered \+w off\+w* \+w you\+w*.’\wj* And suddenly the fruit tree withered up. 
\v 20 When the disciples saw this, they exclaimed in astonishment, ‘How suddenly the fig tree withered up!’ 
\p
\v 21  \wj ‘\+w I\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w*,’\wj* replied Jesus, \wj ‘\+w if\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w faith\+w*, \+w without\+w* \+w ever\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w doubt\+w*, \+w you\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w what\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w only\+w* \+w what\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w been\+w* \+w done\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w fig\+w* \+w tree\+w*, \+w but\+w*, \+w even\+w* \+w if\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w should\+w* \+w say\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w this\+w* \+w hill\+w* “\+w Be\+w* \+w lifted\+w* \+w up\+w* \+w and\+w* hurled \+w into\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w sea\+w*!” \+w it\+w* \+w would\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w done\+w*.\wj* 
\v 22  \wj \+w And\+w* \+w whatever\+w* \+w you\+w* ask \+w for\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w prayers\+w* \+w will\+w*, \+w if\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w faith\+w*, \+w be\+w* granted \+w you\+w*.’\wj* 
\p
\v 23 After Jesus had come into the Temple Courts, the chief priests and the elders of the people came up to him as he was teaching, and said, ‘What authority have you to do these things? Who gave you this authority?’ 
\p
\v 24  \wj ‘\+w I\+w*, too,’\wj* said Jesus in reply, \wj ‘\+w will\+w* \+w ask\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w one\+w* \+w question\+w*; \+w if\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w give\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w an\+w* \+w answer\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w it\+w*, \+w then\+w* \+w I\+w*, \+w also\+w*, \+w will\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w what\+w* \+w authority\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w act\+w* \+w as\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w do\+w*.\wj* 
\v 25  \wj \+w It\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w about\+w* \+w John\+w*’s baptism. \+w What\+w* \+w was\+w* \+w its\+w* origin?

\v 26 But if we say “human,” we are afraid of the people, for everyone regards John as a prophet.’

\v 45 After listening to these parables, the chief priests and the Pharisees saw that it was about them that he was speaking;

\v 1 Once more Jesus spoke to them in parables.

\p
\v 15 Then the Pharisees went away and conferred together as to how they might lay a trap for Jesus in the course of conversation. 
\v 16 They sent their disciples, with the Herodians, to say to him, ‘Teacher, we know that you are an honest person, and that you teach the way of God honestly, and are not afraid of anyone; for you pay no regard to a person’s position. 
\v 17 Tell us, then, what you think. Are we right in paying taxes to the Emperor, or not?’ 
\v 18 Perceiving their malice, Jesus answered, \wj ‘\+w Why\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w testing\+w* \+w me\+w*, \+w you\+w* \+w hypocrites\+w*?\wj* 
\v 19  \wj \+w Show\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w coin\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w which\+w* \+w the\+w* tax \+w is\+w* paid.’\wj* And, when they had brought him a coin, 
\v 20 he asked, \wj ‘\+w Whose\+w* head \+w and\+w* title \+w are\+w* \+w these\+w*?’\wj* 
\v 21 ‘The Emperor’s,’ they answered, at which he said to them, \wj ‘\+w Then\+w* pay \+w to\+w* \+w the\+w* Emperor \+w what\+w* belongs \+w to\+w* \+w the\+w* Emperor, \+w and\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w God\+w* \+w what\+w* belongs \+w to\+w* \+w God\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 22 They wondered at his answer, and left him alone and went away. 
\p
\v 23 That same day some Sadducees came up to Jesus, maintaining that there is no resurrection. Their question was this, – 
\v 24 ‘Teacher, Moses said – “should a man die without children, the man’s brother will become the husband of the widow, and raise a family for his brother.” 
\v 25 Now we had living among us seven brothers; of whom the eldest married and died, and, as he had no family, left his wife for his brother. 
\v 26 The same thing happened to the second and the third brothers, and indeed to all the seven. 
\v 27 The woman herself died last of all. 
\v 28 At the resurrection, then, whose wife will she be out of the seven, all of them having been married to her?’ 
\p
\v 29  \wj ‘\+w Your\+w* mistake,’\wj* replied Jesus, \wj ‘\+w is\+w* due \+w to\+w* \+w your\+w* ignorance \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w scriptures\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w power\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w God\+w*.\wj* 
\v 30  \wj \+w For\+w* \+w at\+w* \+w the\+w* resurrection \+w there\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w no\+w* \+w marrying\+w* \+w or\+w* \+w being\+w* \+w married\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w all\+w* \+w who\+w* rise \+w are\+w* \+w as\+w* angels \+w in\+w* \+w heaven\+w*.\wj* 
\v 31  \wj \+w As\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w the\+w* resurrection \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w dead\+w*, \+w have\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w not\+w* read \+w these\+w* words \+w of\+w* \+w God\+w* –\wj* 
\v 32  \wj “\+w I\+w* \+w am\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w God\+w* \+w of\+w* Abraham, \+w and\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w God\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Isaac\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w God\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Jacob\+w*”? \+w He\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w God\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w dead\+w* \+w people\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w living\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 33 The crowds, who had been listening to him, were greatly struck with his teaching. 
\p
\v 34 When the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they collected together. 
\v 35 Then one of them, a Student of the Law, to test him, asked this question – 
\v 36 ‘Teacher, what is the greatest commandment in the Law?’ 
\v 37 His answer was, \wj ‘\+w You\+w* \+w must\+w* love \+w the\+w* \+w Lord\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w God\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w all\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w heart\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w all\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w soul\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w all\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w mind\+w*.\wj* 
\v 38  \wj \+w This\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w great\+w* \+w first\+w* \+w commandment\+w*.\wj* 
\v 39  \wj \+w The\+w* \+w second\+w*, \+w which\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w like\+w* \+w it\+w*, \+w is\+w* \+w this\+w* – \+w You\+w* \+w must\+w* love \+w your\+w* \+w neighbour\+w* \+w as\+w* \+w you\+w* love \+w yourself\+w*.\wj* 
\v 40  \wj \+w On\+w* \+w these\+w* \+w two\+w* \+w commandments\+w* \+w hang\+w* \+w all\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Law\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w prophets\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 41 Before the Pharisees separated, Jesus put this question to them – 
\v 42  \wj ‘\+w What\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w think\+w* \+w about\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Christ\+w*? \+w Whose\+w* \+w son\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w he\+w*?’\wj* ‘David’s,’ they said. 
\v 43  \wj ‘\+w How\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w it\+w*, \+w then\+w*,’\wj* Jesus replied, \wj ‘\+w that\+w* \+w David\+w*, \+w speaking\+w* \+w under\+w* inspiration, \+w calls\+w* \+w him\+w* “\+w lord\+w*,” \+w in\+w* \+w the\+w* passage –\wj* 
\v 44  \wj “\+w The\+w* \+w Lord\+w* \+w said\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w Lord\+w*: \+w Sit\+w* \+w at\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w right\+w* \+w hand\+w*, \+w until\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w put\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w enemies\+w* \+w beneath\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w feet\+w*”?\wj* 
\v 45  \wj Since, \+w then\+w*, \+w David\+w* \+w calls\+w* \+w him\+w* “\+w lord\+w*,” \+w how\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w he\+w* \+w David\+w*’\+w s\+w* \+w son\+w*?’\wj* 
\v 46 No one could say a word in answer; nor did anyone after that day venture to question him further. 
\c 23  
\p
\v 1 Then Jesus, speaking to the crowds and to his disciples, said,

\v 7 a woman came up to him with an alabaster jar of very costly perfume, and poured the perfume on his head as he sat at the table. 
\v 8 The disciples were indignant at seeing this. ‘What is this waste for?’ they exclaimed. 
\v 9 ‘It could have been sold for a large sum, and the money given to poor people.’ 
\p
\v 10  \wj ‘\+w Why\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w you\+w* troubling \+w the\+w* \+w woman\+w*?’\wj* Jesus said, when he noticed it. \wj ‘\+w For\+w* \+w this\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w beautiful\+w* \+w deed\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w she\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w done\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w me\+w*.\wj* 
\v 11  \wj \+w You\+w* \+w always\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w poor\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w you\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w always\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w me\+w*.\wj* 
\v 12  \wj \+w In\+w* pouring \+w this\+w* \+w perfume\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w body\+w*, \+w she\+w* prepares \+w me\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w burial\+w*.\wj* 
\v 13  \wj \+w I\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w*, \+w wherever\+w*, \+w in\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w whole\+w* \+w world\+w*, \+w this\+w* \+w good\+w* \+w news\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w proclaimed\+w*, \+w what\+w* \+w this\+w* \+w woman\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w done\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w told\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w memory\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w her\+w*.’\wj* 
\p
\v 14 It was then that one of the Twelve, named Judas Iscariot, made his way to the chief priests, 
\v 15 and said ‘What are you willing to give me, if I betray Jesus to you?’ The Priests counted him out thirty pieces of silver as payment. 
\v 16 So from that time Judas looked for an opportunity to betray Jesus. 
\p
\v 17 On the first day of the Festival of the unleavened bread, the disciples came up to Jesus, and said, ‘Where do you wish us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover?’ 
\p
\v 18  \wj ‘\+w Go\+w* \+w into\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w city\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w certain\+w* \+w man\+w*,’\wj* he answered, \wj ‘\+w and\+w* \+w say\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w him\+w* “\+w The\+w* \+w teacher\+w* \+w says\+w* – \+w My\+w* \+w time\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w near\+w*. \+w I\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w keep\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Passover\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w disciples\+w* \+w at\+w* \+w your\+w* house.”’\wj* 
\v 19 The disciples did as Jesus directed them, and prepared the Passover. 
\v 20 In the evening Jesus took his place with the twelve disciples, 
\v 21 and, while they were eating, he said, \wj ‘\+w I\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w one\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w betray\+w* \+w me\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 22 In great grief they began to say to him, one by one, ‘Can it be I, Master?’ 
\p
\v 23  \wj ‘\+w The\+w* \+w one\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w dipped\+w* \+w his\+w* bread beside \+w me\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w the\+w* dish,’\wj* replied Jesus, \wj ‘\+w is\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w one\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w betray\+w* \+w me\+w*.\wj* 
\v 24  \wj \+w True\+w*, \+w the\+w* \+w Son\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Man\+w* \+w must\+w* \+w go\+w*, \+w as\+w* \+w scripture\+w* says \+w of\+w* \+w him\+w*, \+w yet\+w* \+w alas\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w man\+w* \+w by\+w* \+w whom\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Son\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Man\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w being\+w* \+w betrayed\+w*! \+w For\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w man\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w would\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w better\+w* \+w never\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w been\+w* \+w born\+w*!’\wj* 
\v 25 Judas, who was betraying him, turned to him and said, ‘Can it be I, Rabbi?’ 
\p \wj ‘\+w It\+w* \+w is\+w*,’\wj* answered Jesus. 
\p
\v 26 While they were eating, Jesus took some bread, and, after saying the blessing, broke it and, as he gave it to his disciples, said, \wj ‘\+w Take\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w eat\+w* \+w it\+w*; \+w this\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w body\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 27 Then he took a cup, and, after saying the thanksgiving, gave it to them, with the words, \wj ‘\+w Drink\+w* \+w from\+w* \+w it\+w*, \+w all\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w you\+w*;\wj* 
\v 28  \wj \+w for\+w* \+w this\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w covenant\+w* blood, \+w which\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w poured\+w* \+w out\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w many\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w the\+w* forgiveness \+w of\+w* sins.\wj* 
\v 29  \wj \+w I\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w never\+w*, \+w after\+w* \+w this\+w*, \+w drink\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w this\+w* juice \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* grape, \+w until\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w day\+w* \+w when\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w drink\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w new\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w the\+w* kingdom \+w of\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w Father\+w*.’\wj* 
\p
\v 30 They then sang a hymn, and went out to the Mount of Olives. 
\v 31 Then Jesus said to them, \wj ‘\+w Even\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w all\+w* \+w fall\+w* \+w away\+w* \+w from\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w tonight\+w*. \+w Scripture\+w* \+w says\+w* – “\+w I\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w strike\+w* \+w down\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w shepherd\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w sheep\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w flock\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w scattered\+w*.”\wj* 
\v 32  \wj \+w But\+w*, \+w after\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w risen\+w*, \+w I\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w go\+w* \+w before\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w into\+w* \+w Galilee\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 33 ‘If everyone else falls away from you,’ Peter answered, ‘I will never fall away!’ 
\p
\v 34  \wj ‘\+w I\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w*,’\wj* replied Jesus, \wj ‘\+w that\+w* \+w this\+w* \+w very\+w* \+w night\+w*, \+w before\+w* \+w the\+w* cock \+w crows\+w*, \+w you\+w* \+w will\+w* disown \+w me\+w* \+w three\+w* \+w times\+w*!’\wj* 
\v 35 ‘Even if I must die with you,’ Peter exclaimed, ‘I will never disown you!’ All the disciples spoke in the same way. 
\p
\v 36 Then Jesus came with them to a garden called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, \wj ‘\+w Sit\+w* \+w down\+w* \+w here\+w* \+w while\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w go\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w pray\+w* \+w over\+w* \+w there\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 37 Taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to show signs of sadness and deep distress of mind. 
\v 38  \wj ‘\+w I\+w* \+w am\+w* \+w sad\+w* \+w at\+w* \+w heart\+w*,’\wj* he said, \wj ‘\+w sad\+w* \+w even\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w death\+w*; wait \+w here\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w watch\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w me\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 39 Going on a little further, he threw himself on his face in prayer. \wj ‘\+w My\+w* \+w Father\+w*,’\wj* he said, \wj ‘\+w if\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w possible\+w*, \+w let\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w be\+w* spared \+w this\+w* \+w cup\+w*; \+w only\+w*, \+w not\+w* \+w as\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w will\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w as\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w will\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 40 Then he came to his disciples, and found them asleep. \wj ‘\+w What\+w*!’\wj* he said to Peter, \wj ‘\+w could\+w* \+w none\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w watch\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w one\+w* \+w hour\+w*?\wj* 
\v 41  \wj \+w Watch\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w pray\+w* \+w so\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w you\+w* don’\+w t\+w* \+w fall\+w* \+w into\+w* \+w temptation\+w*. \+w True\+w*, \+w the\+w* \+w spirit\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w eager\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w human\+w* nature \+w is\+w* weak.’\wj* 
\v 42 Again, a second time, he went away, and prayed. \wj ‘\+w My\+w* \+w Father\+w*,’\wj* he said, \wj ‘\+w if\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w cannot\+w* \+w be\+w* spared \+w this\+w* \+w cup\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w must\+w* \+w drink\+w* \+w it\+w*, \+w your\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w done\+w*!’\wj* 
\v 43 And coming back again he found them asleep, for their eyes were heavy. 
\v 44 So he left them, and went away again, and prayed a third time, again saying the same words. 
\v 45 Then he came to the disciples, and said, \wj ‘\+w Sleep\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w now\+w*, \+w and\+w* rest yourselves. \+w Look\+w* – \+w my\+w* \+w time\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w close\+w* \+w at\+w* \+w hand\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Son\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Man\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w being\+w* \+w betrayed\+w* \+w into\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w hands\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w wicked\+w* \+w people\+w*.\wj* 
\v 46  \wj \+w Up\+w*, \+w and\+w* let \+w us\+w* \+w be\+w* going. \+w Look\+w*! \+w My\+w* \+w betrayer\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w close\+w* \+w at\+w* \+w hand\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 47 And, while he was still speaking, Judas, who was one of the Twelve, came in sight; and with him was a great crowd of people, with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and elders of the people. 
\v 48 Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them. ‘The man whom I kiss,’ he had said, ‘will be the one; arrest him.’ 
\v 49 So he went up to Jesus at once, and exclaimed, ‘Welcome, Rabbi!’ and kissed him; 
\v 50 at which Jesus said to him, \wj ‘\+w Friend\+w*, \+w do\+w* \+w what\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w come\+w* \+w for\+w*.’\wj* The men went up, seized Jesus, and arrested him. 
\v 51 Suddenly one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and striking the high priest’s servant, cut off his ear. 
\v 52  \wj ‘Sheathe \+w your\+w* \+w sword\+w*,’\wj* Jesus said, \wj ‘\+w for\+w* \+w all\+w* \+w who\+w* draw \+w the\+w* \+w sword\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w put\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w sword\+w*.\wj* 
\v 53  \wj \+w Do\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w think\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w cannot\+w* \+w ask\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w Father\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w help\+w*, \+w when\+w* \+w he\+w* \+w would\+w* \+w at\+w* once send \+w to\+w* \+w my\+w* aid \+w more\+w* \+w than\+w* \+w twelve\+w* \+w legions\+w* \+w of\+w* angels?\wj* 
\v 54  \wj \+w But\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w case\+w* \+w how\+w* \+w would\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w scriptures\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w fulfilled\+w*, \+w which\+w* say \+w that\+w* \+w this\+w* \+w must\+w* \+w be\+w*?’\wj* 
\v 55 Jesus at the same time said to the crowds, \wj ‘\+w Have\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w come\+w* \+w out\+w*, \+w as\+w* \+w if\+w* \+w after\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w robber\+w*, \+w with\+w* \+w swords\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w clubs\+w*, \+w to\+w* \+w take\+w* \+w me\+w*? \+w I\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w sat\+w* \+w teaching\+w* \+w day\+w* \+w after\+w* \+w day\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Temple\+w* Courts, \+w and\+w* \+w yet\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w did\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w arrest\+w* \+w me\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 56 The whole of this occurred in fulfilment of the prophetic scriptures. Then the disciples all forsook him and fled. 
\p
\v 57 Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the Law and elders had assembled. 
\v 58 Peter followed him at a distance as far as the high priest’s courtyard, to see the outcome. 
\v 59 Meanwhile the chief priests and the whole of the High Council were trying to get such false evidence against Jesus, as would warrant putting him to death, 
\v 60 but they did not find any, although many came forward with false evidence. Later on, however, two men came forward and said, 
\v 61 ‘This man said “I am able to destroy the Temple of God, and to build it in three days.”’ 
\v 62 Then the high priest stood up, and said to Jesus, ‘Have you no answer? What is this evidence which these men are giving against you?’ 
\v 63 But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, ‘I order you, by the living God, to tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God.’ 
\p
\v 64  \wj ‘\+w It\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w true\+w*,’\wj* Jesus answered, \wj ‘\+w Moreover\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w all\+w* \+w that\+w* hereafter \+w you\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w see\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Son\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Man\+w* \+w sitting\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w right\+w* \+w hand\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* Almighty, \+w and\+w* \+w coming\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w clouds\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w heavens\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 65 Then the high priest tore his robes. ‘This is blasphemy!’ he exclaimed. ‘Why do we want any more witnesses? You have just heard his blasphemy! 
\v 66 What is your decision?’ They answered, ‘He deserves death.’ 
\v 67 Then they spat in his face, and struck him, while others dealt blows at him, saying as they did so, 
\v 68 ‘Now play the prophet for us, you Christ! Who was it that struck you?’ 
\v 69 Peter, meanwhile, was sitting outside in the courtyard; and a maidservant came up to him, and exclaimed, ‘Why, you were with Jesus the Galilean!’ 
\v 70 But Peter denied it before them all. ‘I do not know what you mean,’ he replied. 
\v 71 When he had gone out into the gateway, another maid saw him, and said to those who were there, ‘This man was with Jesus of Nazareth!’ 
\v 72 Again he denied it with an oath, ‘I do not know the man!’ 
\v 73 But soon afterwards those who were standing by came up and said to Peter, ‘You also are certainly one of them; why, even your way of speaking proves it!’ 
\v 74 Then Peter said, ‘I swear that I do not know the man! May God punish me if I am lying!’ At that moment a cock crowed; 
\v 75 and Peter remembered the words which Jesus had said – \wj “\+w Before\+w* \+w a\+w* cock \+w has\+w* \+w crowed\+w*, \+w you\+w* \+w will\+w* disown \+w me\+w* \+w three\+w* \+w times\+w*”;\wj* and he went outside, and wept bitterly. 
\c 27  
\p
\v 1 At daybreak all the chief priests and the elders of the people consulted together against Jesus, to bring about his death. 
\v 2 They put him in chains and led him away, and gave him up to the Roman Governor, Pilate. 
\v 3 Then Judas, who betrayed him, seeing that Jesus was condemned, repented of what he had done, and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders. 
\v 4 ‘I did wrong in betraying a good man to his death,’ he said. ‘What has that to do with us?’ they replied. ‘You must see to that yourself.’ 
\v 5 Judas flung down the pieces of silver in the Temple, and left; and went away and hanged himself. 
\v 6 The chief priests took the pieces of silver, but they said, ‘We must not put them into the Temple treasury, because they are blood-money.’ 
\v 7 So, after consultation, they used it to buy the “Potter’s Field” as a burial ground for foreigners, 
\v 8 and that is why that field is called the “Field of Blood” to this very day. 
\v 9 Then it was that these words spoken by the prophet Jeremiah were fulfilled – “They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price set on him by the people of Israel, 
\v 10 and gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord commanded me.” 
\v 11 Meanwhile Jesus was brought before the Roman Governor. ‘Are you the king of the Jews?’ asked the Governor. \wj ‘\+w It\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w true\+w*,’\wj* answered Jesus. 
\v 12 While charges were being brought against him by the chief priests and elders, Jesus made no reply. 
\v 13 Then Pilate said to him, ‘Don’t you hear how many accusations they are making against you?’ 
\v 14 Yet Jesus made no reply – not even a single word; at which the Governor was greatly astonished. 
\v 15 Now, at the feast, the Governor was accustomed to grant the people the release of any one prisoner whom they might choose. 
\v 16 At that time they had a notorious prisoner called Barabbas. 
\v 17 So, when the people had collected, Pilate said to them, ‘Which do you wish me to release for you? Barabbas? Or Jesus who is called “Christ”?’ 
\v 18 For he knew that it was out of jealousy that they had given Jesus up to him. 
\v 19 While he was still on the Bench, his wife sent this message to him – ‘Do not have anything to do with that good man, for I have been very much troubled today in a dream because of him.’ 
\v 20 But the chief priests and elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas, and to kill Jesus. 
\v 21 The Governor, however, said to them, ‘Which of these two do you wish me to release for you?’ 
\p ‘Barabbas,’ they answered. 
\v 22 ‘What then,’ Pilate asked, ‘should I do with Jesus who is called “Christ?”’ ‘Crucify him,’ they all replied. 
\v 23 ‘Why, what harm has he done?’ he asked. But they kept shouting furiously, ‘Crucify him!’ 
\v 24 When Pilate saw that his efforts were unavailing, but that, on the contrary, a riot was beginning, he took some water, and washed his hands in the sight of the crowd, saying as he did so, ‘I am not answerable for this bloodshed; you must see to it yourselves.’ 
\v 25 And all the people answered, ‘His blood be on our heads and on our children’s!’ 
\v 26 Then Pilate released Barabbas to them, but Jesus he had scourged, and gave him up to be crucified. 
\p
\v 27 After that, the Governor’s soldiers took Jesus with them into the Government house, and gathered the whole garrison round him. 
\v 28 They stripped him, and put on him a red military cloak, 
\v 29 and having twisted some thorns into a crown, put it on his head, and a rod in his right hand, and then, going down on their knees before him, they mocked him. ‘Long life to you, king of the Jews!’ they said. 
\v 30 They spat at him and, taking the rod, kept striking him on the head; 
\v 31 and, when they had left off mocking him, they took off the military cloak, and put his own clothes on him, and led him away to be crucified. 
\p
\v 32 As they were on their way out, they came upon a man from Cyrene called Simon, and they compelled him to go with them to carry the cross. 
\v 33 On reaching a place named Golgotha (a place named from its likeness to a skull), 
\v 34 they gave him some wine to drink which had been mixed with gall; but after tasting it, Jesus refused to drink it. 
\v 35 When they had crucified him, they divided his clothes among them by casting lots. 
\v 36 Then they sat down, and kept watch over him there. 
\v 37 Above his head they fixed the accusation against him written out – “THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.” 
\v 38 At the same time two robbers were crucified with him, one on the right, the other on the left. 
\v 39 The passers-by railed at him, shaking their heads as they said, 
\v 40 ‘You who would “destroy the Temple and build one in three days,” save yourself! If you are God’s Son, come down from the cross!’ 
\v 41 In the same way the chief priests, with the Teachers of the Law and elders, said in mockery, 
\v 42 ‘He saved others, but he cannot save himself! He is the “king of Israel”! Why doesn’t he come down from the cross now, then we will believe in him. 
\v 43 He has trusted in God; if God wants him, let him deliver him now; for he said “I am God’s Son.”’ 
\v 44 Even the robbers, who were crucified with him, insulted him in the same way. 
\v 45 After midday a darkness came over all the country, lasting until three in the afternoon. 
\v 46 About three Jesus called out loudly, \wj ‘\+w Eloi\+w*, \+w Eloi\+w*, \+w lema\+w* sabacthani’\wj* – that is to say, \wj “\+w My\+w* \+w God\+w*, \+w my\+w* \+w God\+w*, \+w why\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w forsaken\+w* \+w me\+w*?”\wj* 
\v 47 Some of those standing by heard this, and said, ‘The man is calling for Elijah!’ 
\v 48 One of them immediately ran and took a sponge, and, filling it with common wine, put it on the end of a rod, and offered it to him to drink. 
\v 49 But the rest said, ‘Wait and let us see if Elijah is coming to save him.’\f + \fr 27.49  \ft  Some later manuscripts add: However another man took a spear, and pierced his side; and water and blood flowed from it.\f* 
\v 50 But Jesus, uttering another loud cry, gave up his spirit. 
\v 51 Suddenly the Temple curtain was torn in two from top to bottom, the earth shook, the rocks were torn asunder, 
\v 52 the tombs opened, and the bodies of many of God’s people who had fallen asleep rose, 
\v 53 and they, leaving their tombs, went, after the resurrection of Jesus, into the Holy City, and appeared to many people. 
\v 54 The Roman centurion, and the men with him who were watching Jesus, on seeing the earthquake and all that was happening, became greatly frightened and exclaimed, ‘This must indeed have been God’s Son!’ 
\v 55 There were many women there, watching from a distance, who had accompanied Jesus from Galilee and had been attending on him. 
\v 56 Among them were Mary of Magdala, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee’s sons. 
\p
\v 57 When evening had fallen, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus. 
\v 58 He went to see Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. Pilate ordered it to be given him. 
\v 59 So Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen sheet, 
\v 60 and laid it in his newly made tomb which he had cut in the rock; and, before he left, he rolled a great stone against the entrance of the tomb. 
\v 61 Mary of Magdala and the other Mary remained behind, sitting in front of the grave. 
\p
\v 62 The next day – that is, the day following the Preparation-day – the chief priests and Pharisees came in a body to Pilate, and said, 
\v 63 ‘Sir, we remember that, during his lifetime, that impostor said \wj “\+w I\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w rise\+w* \+w after\+w* \+w three\+w* \+w days\+w*.”\wj* 
\v 64 So order the tomb to be made secure until the third day. Otherwise his disciples may come and steal him, and then say to the people “He has risen from the dead,” when the latest imposture will be worse than the first.’ 
\p
\v 65 ‘You may have a guard,’ was Pilate’s reply. ‘Go and make the tomb as secure as you can.’ 
\v 66 So they went and made the tomb secure, by sealing the stone, in presence of the guard.

\s1 The Risen Life 
\p
\v 1 After the Sabbath, as the first day of the week began to dawn, Mary of Magdala and the other Mary had gone to look at the grave, 
\v 2 when suddenly a great earthquake occurred. For an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled away the stone, and seated himself on it. 
\v 3 His appearance was as dazzling as lightning, and his clothing was as white as snow; 
\v 4 and, in their terror of him, the men on guard trembled violently and became like dead men. 
\v 5 But the angel, addressing the women, said, ‘You need not be afraid. I know that it is Jesus, who was crucified, for whom you are looking. 
\v 6 He is not here; for he has risen, as he said he would. Come, and see the place where he was lying; 
\v 7 and then go quickly and say to his disciples “He has risen from the dead, and is going before you into Galilee; there you will see him.” Remember, I have told you.’ 
\v 8 They left the tomb quickly, in awe and great joy, and ran to tell the news to the disciples. 
\v 9 Suddenly Jesus met them. \wj ‘Welcome!’\wj* he said. The women went up to him, and clasped his feet, bowing to the ground before him. Then Jesus said to them, 
\v 10  \wj ‘\+w Do\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w afraid\+w*; \+w go\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w my\+w* brothers \+w and\+w* sisters \+w to\+w* \+w set\+w* \+w out\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w Galilee\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w they\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w see\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w there\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 11 While they were still on their way, some of the guard came into the city, and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened. 
\v 12 So they and the elders met and, after holding a consultation, gave a large sum of money to the soldiers, 
\v 13 and told them to say that his disciples came in the night, and stole him while they were asleep; 
\v 14 ‘And should this matter come before the Governor,’ they added, ‘we will satisfy him, and see that you have nothing to fear.’ 
\v 15 So the soldiers took the money, and did as they were instructed. This story spread widely; the people of Judea still tell it today. 
\p
\v 16 The eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus told them to meet him; 
\v 17 and, when they saw him, they bowed to the ground before him; although some felt doubtful. 
\v 18 Then Jesus came up, and spoke to them, saying, \wj ‘\+w All\+w* \+w authority\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w heaven\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w earth\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w been\+w* \+w given\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w me\+w*.\wj* 
\v 19  \wj \+w Therefore\+w* \+w go\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w make\+w* \+w disciples\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w all\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w nations\+w*, baptizing \+w them\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w name\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Father\+w*, \+w the\+w* \+w Son\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Holy\+w* \+w Spirit\+w*,\wj*
