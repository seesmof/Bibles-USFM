\s1 Introduction 
\p
\q1
\v 1 In the beginning the Word was; 
\q2 and the Word was with God; 
\q2 and the Word was God. 
\m
\q1
\v 2 He was in the beginning with God; 
\q2
\v 3 through him all things came into being, 
\q2 and nothing came into being apart from him. 
\q1
\v 4 That which came into being in him was life; 
\q2 and the life was the light of humanity; 
\q2
\v 5 and the light shines in the darkness, 
\q2 and the darkness never overpowered it. 
\m
\q1
\v 6 There appeared a man sent from God, whose name was John; 
\q2
\v 7 he came as a witness – to bear witness to the light 
\q2 so that through him everyone might believe. 
\q1
\v 8 He was not the light, 
\q2 but he came to bear witness to the light. 
\m
\q1
\v 9 That was the true light which enlightens everyone coming into the world. 
\q1
\v 10 He was in the world; 
\q2 and through him the world came into being – 
\q2 yet the world did not know him. 
\m
\q1
\v 11 He came to his own – 
\q2 yet his own did not receive him. 
\q1
\v 12 But to all who did receive him he gave power to become children of God – 
\q2 to those who believe in his name. 
\q1
\v 13 For not to natural conception, nor to human instincts, nor to human will did they owe the new life, 
\q2 but to God. 
\m
\q1
\v 14 And the Word became human, and lived among us, 
\q2 (We saw his glory – the glory of the Only Son sent from the Father), 
\q2 full of love and truth. 
\q1
\v 15 (John bears witness to him; he cried aloud – for it was he who spoke – 
\q2 ‘He who is coming after me is now before me, 
\q2 for he was ever first’); 
\q1
\v 16 out of his fullness we have all received 
\q2 gift after gift of love; 
\q1
\v 17 for the Law was given through Moses, 
\q2 love and truth came through Jesus Christ. 
\q1
\v 18 No one has ever yet seen God; 
\q2 God the only Son, who is ever with the Father – 
\q1 he has revealed him. 
\m
\s1 The Preparation 
\p
\v 19 When the religious authorities in Jerusalem sent some Priests and Levites to ask John – ‘Who are you?’, 
\v 20 he told them clearly and simply, ‘I am not the Christ.’ 
\p
\v 21 ‘What then?’ they asked. ‘Are you Elijah?’ 
\p ‘No,’ he said, ‘I am not.’ 
\p ‘Are you “the prophet”?’ He answered, ‘No.’ 
\p
\v 22 ‘Who then are you?’ they continued. ‘Tell us so that we have an answer to give to those who have sent us. What do you say about yourself?’ 
\p
\v 23 ‘I,’ he answered, ‘am – 
\q1 “The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness: make a straight road for the Lord”, 
\b
\m as the prophet Isaiah said.’ 
\p
\v 24 These men had been sent from the Pharisees; 
\v 25 and their next question was, ‘Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ or Elijah or “the prophet”?’ 
\v 26 John’s answer was – ‘I baptize with water, but among you stands one whom you do not know; 
\v 27 he is coming after me, yet I am not worthy even to unfasten his sandal.’ 
\v 28 This happened at Bethany, across the Jordan, where John was baptizing. 
\p
\v 29 The next day John saw Jesus coming towards him, and exclaimed, ‘Here is the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! 
\v 30 I was talking about him when I said “After me there is coming a man who ranks ahead of me, because before I was born he already was.” 
\v 31 I did not know who he was, but I have come baptizing with water to make him known to Israel.’ 
\v 32 John also said: 
\p ‘I saw the Spirit come down from heaven like a dove and rest on him. 
\v 33 I myself did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water, he said to me “He on whom you see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him – he it is who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.” 
\v 34 This I have seen myself, and I have declared my belief that he is the Son of God.’ 
\b
\p
\v 35 The next day, when John was standing with two of his disciples, 
\v 36 he looked at Jesus as he passed and exclaimed, ‘There is the Lamb of God!’ 
\v 37 The two disciples heard him say this, and followed Jesus. 
\v 38 But Jesus turned round, and saw them following. \wj ‘\+w What\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w looking\+w* \+w for\+w*?’\wj* he asked. ‘Rabbi,’ they answered (or, as we should say, “Teacher”), ‘where are you staying?’ 
\p
\v 39  \wj ‘\+w Come\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w see\+w*,’\wj* he replied. So they went, and saw where he was staying, and spent that day with him. 
\p It was then about four in the afternoon. 
\v 40 One of the two, who heard what John said and followed Jesus, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother. 
\v 41 He first found his own brother Simon, and said to him, ‘We have found the Messiah!’ (a word which means “Christ,” or “Consecrated”.) 
\v 42 Then he brought him to Jesus. Looking straight at him, Jesus said, \wj ‘\+w You\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w Simon\+w*, \+w the\+w* \+w son\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w John\+w*; \+w you\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w called\+w* \+w Cephas\+w*’\wj* (which means “Peter,” or “Rock”). 
\v 43 The following day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. He found Philip, and said to him, \wj ‘Follow \+w me\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 44 Philip was from Bethsaida, the same town as Andrew and Peter. 
\v 45 He found Nathanael and said to him, ‘We have found him of whom Moses wrote in the Law, and of whom the prophets also wrote – Jesus of Nazareth, Joseph’s son!’ 
\p
\v 46 ‘Can anything good come out of Nazareth?’ asked Nathanael. ‘Come and see,’ replied Philip. 
\v 47 When Jesus saw Nathanael coming towards him, he said, \wj ‘\+w Here\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w a\+w* true \+w Israelite\+w*, \+w in\+w* \+w whom\+w* \+w there\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w no\+w* \+w deceit\+w*!’\wj* 
\p
\v 48 ‘How do you know me?’ asked Nathanael. \wj ‘\+w Even\+w* \+w before\+w* \+w Philip\+w* \+w called\+w* \+w you\+w*,’\wj* replied Jesus, \wj ‘\+w when\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w were\+w* \+w under\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w fig\+w* \+w tree\+w*, \+w I\+w* \+w saw\+w* \+w you\+w*.’\wj* 
\p
\v 49 ‘Rabbi,’ Nathanael exclaimed, ‘you are the Son of God, you are king of Israel!’ 
\p
\v 50  \wj ‘\+w Do\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w believe\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w me\+w*,’\wj* asked Jesus, \wj ‘\+w because\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w told\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w saw\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w under\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w fig\+w* \+w tree\+w*? \+w You\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w see\+w* \+w greater\+w* \+w things\+w* \+w than\+w* \+w those\+w*!\wj* 
\v 51  \wj \+w In\+w* truth \+w I\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w*,’\wj* he added, \wj ‘\+w you\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w all\+w* \+w see\+w* \+w heaven\+w* open, \+w and\+w* \+w the\+w* angels \+w of\+w* \+w God\+w* ascending \+w and\+w* \+w descending\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Son\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Man\+w*.’\wj* 
\c 2  
\s1 The Work in Judaea, Galilee and Samaria 
\p
\v 1 Two days after this there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and Jesus’ mother was there. 
\v 2 Jesus himself, too, with his disciples, was invited to the wedding. 
\v 3 And, when the wine ran short, his mother said to him, ‘They have no wine left.’ 
\p
\v 4  \wj ‘\+w What\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w you\+w* want \+w with\+w* \+w me\+w*?’\wj* answered Jesus. \wj ‘\+w My\+w* \+w time\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w come\+w* \+w yet\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 5 His mother said to the servants, ‘Do whatever he tells you.’ 
\v 6 There were standing there six stone water-jars, in accordance with the Jewish rule of purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons. 
\p
\v 7 Jesus said to the servants, \wj ‘\+w Fill\+w* \+w the\+w* water-jars \+w with\+w* \+w water\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 8 And, when they had filled them to the brim, he added, \wj ‘\+w Now\+w* \+w take\+w* \+w some\+w* \+w out\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w carry\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w the\+w* Master \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* feast.’\wj* The servants did so. 
\v 9 And, when the Master of the feast had tasted the water which had now become wine, not knowing where it had come from – although the servants who had taken out the water knew – 
\v 10 He called the groom and said to him, ‘Everyone puts good wine on the table first, and inferior wine afterwards, when his guests have drunk freely; but you have kept back the good wine till now!’ 
\v 11 This, the first sign of his mission, Jesus gave at Cana in Galilee, and by it revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him. 
\b
\p
\v 12 After this, Jesus went down to Capernaum – he, his mother, his brothers, and his disciples; but they stayed there only a few days. 
\b
\p
\v 13 Then, as the Jewish Passover was near, Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 
\v 14 In the Temple Courts he found people who were selling bullocks, sheep, and pigeons, and the money changers at their counters. 
\v 15 So he made a whip of cords, and drove them all out of the Temple Courts, and the sheep and bullocks as well; he scattered the money of the money changers, and overturned their tables, 
\v 16 and said to the pigeon-dealers, \wj ‘\+w Take\+w* \+w these\+w* \+w things\+w* away. \+w Do\+w* \+w not\+w* turn \+w my\+w* \+w Father\+w*’s \+w house\+w* \+w into\+w* \+w a\+w* market \+w house\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 17 His disciples remembered that scripture said – “Passion for your house will consume me.” 
\p
\v 18 Then some of the religious authorities asked Jesus, ‘What sign are you going to show us, since you act in this way?’ 
\p
\v 19  \wj ‘\+w Destroy\+w* \+w this\+w* \+w temple\+w*,’\wj* was his answer, \wj ‘\+w and\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w raise\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w three\+w* \+w days\+w*.’\wj* 
\p
\v 20 ‘This Temple,’ the authorities replied, ‘has been forty-six years in building, and are you going to “raise it in three days”?’ 
\v 21 But Jesus was speaking of his body as a temple. 
\v 22 Afterwards, when he had risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this; and they believed the passage of scripture, and the words which Jesus had spoken. 
\b
\p
\v 23 While Jesus was in Jerusalem, during the Passover Festival, many came to trust in him, when they saw the signs of his mission that he was giving. 
\v 24 But Jesus did not put himself in their power because he knew what was in their hearts. 
\v 25 He did not need anyone to tell him about people because he could read what was in them. 
\c 3  
\b
\p
\v 1 Now there was a Pharisee named Nicodemus, who was a leading man among his people. 
\v 2 This man came to Jesus by night, and said to him, ‘Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God; for no one could give such signs as you are giving, unless God were with him.’ 
\p
\v 3  \wj ‘\+w In\+w* truth \+w I\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w*,’\wj* exclaimed Jesus, \wj ‘\+w unless\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w person\+w* \+w is\+w* reborn, \+w they\+w* \+w cannot\+w* \+w see\+w* \+w the\+w* kingdom \+w of\+w* \+w God\+w*.’\wj* 
\p
\v 4 ‘How can a person,’ asked Nicodemus, ‘be born when they are old? Can they be born a second time?’ 
\p
\v 5  \wj ‘\+w In\+w* truth \+w I\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w*,’\wj* answered Jesus, \wj ‘\+w unless\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w person\+w* owes \+w their\+w* \+w birth\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w water\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w Spirit\+w*, \+w they\+w* \+w cannot\+w* \+w enter\+w* \+w the\+w* kingdom \+w of\+w* \+w God\+w*.\wj* 
\v 6  \wj \+w All\+w* \+w that\+w* owes \+w its\+w* \+w birth\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w human\+w* nature \+w is\+w* \+w human\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w all\+w* \+w that\+w* owes \+w its\+w* \+w birth\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Spirit\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w spiritual\+w*.\wj* 
\v 7  \wj \+w Do\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w wonder\+w* \+w at\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w telling\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w all\+w* need \+w to\+w* \+w be\+w* reborn.\wj* 
\v 8  \wj \+w The\+w* \+w wind\+w* \+w blows\+w* \+w wherever\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w wants\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w can\+w* \+w hear\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w sound\+w* \+w it\+w* makes, \+w but\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w know\+w* \+w where\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w comes\+w* \+w from\+w*, \+w or\+w* \+w where\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w goes\+w*; \+w it\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w same\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w everyone\+w* \+w who\+w* owes \+w his\+w* \+w birth\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Spirit\+w*.’\wj* 
\p
\v 9 ‘How can that be?’ asked Nicodemus. 
\v 10  \wj ‘\+w What\+w*! \+w You\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w teacher\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Israel\+w*,’\wj* exclaimed Jesus, \wj ‘\+w and\+w* \+w yet\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w understand\+w* \+w this\+w*!\wj* 
\v 11  \wj \+w In\+w* truth \+w I\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w we\+w* \+w speak\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w what\+w* \+w we\+w* \+w know\+w*, \+w and\+w* state \+w what\+w* \+w we\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w seen\+w*; \+w and\+w* \+w yet\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w accept\+w* \+w our\+w* statements.\wj* 
\v 12  \wj \+w If\+w*, \+w when\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w earthly\+w* \+w things\+w*, \+w you\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w believe\+w* \+w me\+w*, \+w how\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w believe\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w when\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w heavenly\+w* \+w things\+w*?\wj* 
\v 13  \wj \+w No\+w* \+w one\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w ascended\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w heaven\+w*, \+w except\+w* \+w him\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w descended\+w* \+w from\+w* \+w heaven\+w* – \+w the\+w* \+w Son\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Man\+w* \+w himself\+w*.\wj*

\p
\v 22 After this, Jesus went with his disciples into the country parts of Judea; and there he stayed with them, and baptized. 
\v 23 John, also, was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there were many streams there; and people were constantly coming and being baptized. 
\v 24 (For John had not yet been imprisoned). 
\v 25 Now a discussion arose between some of John’s disciples and a fellow Jew on the subject of purification; 
\v 26 and the disciples came to John and said, ‘Rabbi, the man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan, and to whom you have yourself borne testimony – he, also, is baptizing, and everybody is going to him.’ 
\v 27 John’s answer was – ‘A person can gain nothing but what is given them from heaven. 
\v 28 You are yourselves witnesses that I said “I am not the Christ,” but “I have been sent before him as a messenger.” 
\v 29 It is the groom who has the bride; but the groom’s friend, who stands by and listens to him, is filled with joy when he hears the groom’s voice. This joy I have felt to the full. 
\v 30 He must become greater, and I less.’ 
\p
\v 31 He who comes from above is above all others; but a child of earth is earthly, and his teaching is earthly, too. He who comes from heaven is above all others. 
\v 32 He states what he has seen and what he heard, and yet no one accepts his statement. 
\v 33 They who did accept his statement confirm the fact that God is true. 
\v 34 For he whom God sent as his messenger gives us God’s own teaching, for God does not limit the gift of the Spirit. 
\v 35 The Father loves his Son, and has put everything in his hands. 
\v 36 The person who believes in the Son has eternal life, while a person who rejects the Son will not even see that life, but remains under God’s displeasure.

\p
\v 1 Now, when the Master heard that the Pharisees had been told that he was making and baptizing more disciples than John 
\v 2 (Though it was not Jesus himself, but his disciples, who baptized), 
\v 3 he left Judea, and set out again for Galilee. 
\v 4 He had to pass through Samaria, 
\v 5 and, on his way, he came to a Samaritan town called Shechem, near the plot of land that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. 
\v 6 Jacob’s Spring was there, and Jesus, being tired after his journey, sat down beside the spring, just as he was. It was then about midday. 
\v 7 A woman of Samaria came to draw water; and Jesus said to her – \wj ‘\+w Give\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w some\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w drink\+w*,’\wj*

\p
\v 25 ‘I know,’ answered the woman, ‘that the Messiah, who is called the Christ, is coming; when once he has come, he will tell us everything.’ 
\p
\v 26  \wj ‘\+w I\+w* \+w am\+w* \+w he\+w*,’\wj* Jesus said to her, \wj ‘\+w I\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w am\+w* \+w speaking\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w you\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 27 At this moment his disciples came up, and were surprised to find him talking with a woman; but none of them asked “What do you want?” or “Why are you talking with her?” 
\v 28 So the woman, leaving her pitcher, went back to the town, and said to the people, 
\v 29 ‘Come and see someone who has told me everything that I have done. Can he be the Christ?’ 
\v 30 And the people left the town and went to see Jesus. 
\p
\v 31 Meanwhile the disciples kept saying to him, ‘Take something to eat, Rabbi.’ 
\p
\v 32  \wj ‘\+w I\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w food\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w eat\+w*,’\wj* he answered, \wj ‘\+w of\+w* \+w which\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w know\+w* \+w nothing\+w*.’\wj* 
\p
\v 33 ‘Can anyone have brought him anything to eat?’ the disciples said to one another. 
\v 34  \wj ‘\+w My\+w* \+w food\+w*,’\wj* replied Jesus, \wj ‘\+w is\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w him\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w sent\+w* \+w me\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w complete\+w* \+w his\+w* \+w work\+w*.\wj*

\p
\v 39 Many from that town came to believe in Jesus – Samaritans though they were – because the woman had said, “He has told me everything that I have done.” 
\v 40 And, when these Samaritans had come to Jesus, they begged him to stay with them, and he stayed there two days. 
\v 41 But far more came to believe in him because of what he said himself, 
\v 42 and they said to the woman, ‘It is no longer because of what you say that we believe in him, for we have heard him ourselves and know that he really is the Saviour of the world.’ 
\b
\p
\v 43 After these two days Jesus went on to Galilee; 
\v 44 for he himself declared that “a prophet is not honoured in his own country.” 
\v 45 When he entered Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, for they had seen all that he did at Jerusalem during the Festival, at which they also had been present. 
\v 46 So Jesus came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. Now there was one of the king’s officers whose son was lying ill at Capernaum. 
\v 47 When this man heard that Jesus had returned from Judea to Galilee, he went to him, and begged him to come down and cure his son; for he was at the point of death. 
\v 48 Jesus answered, \wj ‘\+w Unless\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w all\+w* \+w see\+w* \+w signs\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w wonders\+w*, \+w you\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w believe\+w*.’\wj* 
\p
\v 49 ‘Sir,’ said the officer, ‘come down before my child dies.’ And Jesus answered, ‘Go, your son is living.’ 
\v 50 The man believed what Jesus said to him, and went; 
\v 51 and, while he was on his way down, his servants met him, and told him that his child was living. 
\v 52 So he asked them at what time the boy began to get better. ‘It was yesterday, about one o’clock,’ they said, ‘that the fever left him.’ 
\v 53 By this the father knew that it was at the very time when Jesus had said to him \wj “\+w Your\+w* \+w son\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w living\+w*”\wj*; and he himself, with all his household, believed in Jesus. 
\v 54 This was the second occasion on which Jesus gave a sign of his mission on coming from Judea to Galilee. 
\c 5  
\b
\p
\v 1 Sometime after this there was a Jewish Festival; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 
\v 2 There is in Jerusalem, near the sheep-gate, a bath with five colonnades round it. It is called in Hebrew “Bethesda.” 
\v 3 In these colonnades a large number of sick people were lying – blind, lame, and crippled. 
\v 4  \f + \fr 5.4  \ft Some later manuscripts add: for an angel of the Lord went down at certain times into the pool, and stirred up the water. The first person to step in after the stirring of the water was healed of whatever disease they had.\f* 
\v 5 One man who was there had been crippled for thirty-eight years. 
\v 6 Jesus saw the man lying there, and, finding that he had been in this state a long time, said to him, \wj ‘\+w Do\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w wish\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w be\+w* cured?’\wj* 
\p
\v 7 ‘I have no one, Sir,’ the sick man answered, ‘to put me into the bath when there is a troubling of the water, and, while I am getting to it, someone else steps down before me.’ 
\p
\v 8  \wj ‘\+w Stand\+w* \+w up\+w*,’\wj* said Jesus, \wj ‘\+w take\+w* \+w up\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w mat\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w walk\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 9 The man was cured immediately, and took up his mat and began walking. 
\v 10 Now it was the Sabbath. So the religious authorities said to the man who had been cured, ‘This is the Sabbath; you must not carry your mat.’ 
\p
\v 11 ‘The man who cured me,’ he answered, ‘said to me \wj “\+w Take\+w* \+w up\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w mat\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w walk\+w*.”’\wj* 
\p
\v 12 ‘Who was it,’ they asked, ‘that said to you \wj “\+w Take\+w* \+w up\+w* \+w your\+w* mat \+w and\+w* \+w walk\+w*”?’\wj* 
\v 13 But the man who had been restored did not know who it was; for Jesus had moved away, because there was a crowd there. 
\v 14 Afterwards Jesus found the man in the Temple Courts, and said to him, \wj ‘\+w You\+w* \+w are\+w* cured \+w now\+w*; \+w do\+w* \+w not\+w* sin \+w again\+w*, \+w or\+w* \+w something\+w* \+w worse\+w* \+w may\+w* \+w happen\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w you\+w*.’\wj* 
\p
\v 15 The man went away, and told the authorities that it was Jesus who had cured him. 
\v 16 And that was why they began to persecute Jesus – because he did things of this kind on the Sabbath. 
\v 17 But Jesus replied, \wj ‘\+w My\+w* \+w Father\+w* \+w works\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w this\+w* \+w very\+w* hour, \+w and\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w work\+w* \+w also\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 18 This made the authorities all the more eager to kill him, because not only was he doing away with the Sabbath, but he actually called God his own Father – putting himself on an equality with God. 
\p
\v 19 So Jesus made this further reply, \wj ‘\+w In\+w* truth \+w I\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w*, \+w the\+w* \+w Son\+w* \+w can\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w nothing\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w himself\+w*; \+w he\+w* \+w does\+w* \+w only\+w* \+w what\+w* \+w he\+w* sees \+w the\+w* \+w Father\+w* \+w doing\+w*; \+w whatever\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Father\+w* \+w does\+w*, \+w the\+w* \+w Son\+w* \+w does\+w* \+w also\+w*.\wj*

\v 1 After this, Jesus crossed the Sea of Galilee – otherwise called the Lake of Tiberias. 
\v 2 A great crowd of people, however, followed him, because they saw the signs of his mission in his work among those who were sick. 
\v 3 Jesus went up the hill, and sat down there with his disciples. 
\v 4 It was near the time of the Jewish Festival of the Passover. 
\v 5 Looking up, and noticing that a great crowd was coming towards him, Jesus said to Philip, \wj ‘\+w Where\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w we\+w* \+w to\+w* buy bread \+w for\+w* \+w these\+w* \+w people\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w eat\+w*?’\wj* 
\v 6 He said this to test him, for he himself knew what he meant to do. 
\v 7 ‘Even if we spent a years’ wages on bread,’ answered Philip, ‘it would not be enough for each of them to have a little.’ 
\p
\v 8 ‘There is a boy here,’ said Andrew, another of his disciples, Simon Peter’s brother, 
\v 9 ‘Who has five barley loaves and two fish; but what is that for so many?’ 
\p
\v 10  \wj ‘\+w Make\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w people\+w* sit down,’\wj* said Jesus. It was a grassy spot; so the people, who numbered about five thousand, sat down, 
\v 11 and then Jesus took the loaves, and, after saying the thanksgiving, distributed them to those who were sitting down; and the same with the fish, giving the people as much as they wanted. 
\v 12 When they were satisfied, Jesus said to his disciples, \wj ‘Collect \+w the\+w* \+w broken\+w* \+w pieces\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w left\+w*, \+w so\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w nothing\+w* \+w may\+w* \+w be\+w* wasted.’\wj* 
\v 13 The disciples did so, and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves, which were left after all had eaten. 
\p
\v 14 When the people saw the signs which Jesus gave, they said, ‘This is certainly the prophet who was to come into the world.’ 
\v 15 But Jesus, having discovered that they were intending to come and carry him off to make him king, went again up the hill, quite alone. 
\p
\v 16 When evening fell, his disciples went down to the sea, 
\v 17 and, getting into a boat, began to cross to Capernaum. By this time darkness had set in, and Jesus had not yet come back to them; 
\v 18 the sea, too, was getting rough, for a strong wind was blowing. 
\v 19 When they had rowed three or four miles, they caught sight of him walking on the water and approaching the boat, and they were frightened. 
\v 20 But Jesus said to them, \wj ‘\+w It\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w I\+w*; \+w do\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w afraid\+w*!’\wj* 
\v 21 And after this they were glad to take him into the boat; and the boat at once arrived off the shore, for which they had been making. 
\b
\p
\v 22 The people who remained on the other side of the sea had seen that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not gone into it with his disciples, but that they had left without him. 
\v 23 Some boats, however, had come from Tiberias, from near the spot where they had eaten the bread after the Master had said the thanksgiving. 
\v 24 So, on the next day, when the people saw that Jesus was not there, or his disciples either, they themselves got into the boats, and went to Capernaum to look for him. 
\v 25 And, when they found him on the other side of the sea, they said, ‘When did you get here, Rabbi?’ 
\p
\v 26  \wj ‘\+w In\+w* truth \+w I\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w*,’\wj* answered Jesus, \wj ‘\+w it\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w because\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w signs\+w* \+w which\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w saw\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w looking\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w me\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w because\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w had\+w* \+w the\+w* bread \+w to\+w* \+w eat\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w were\+w* \+w satisfied\+w*.\wj*

\p
\v 59 All this Jesus said in a synagogue, when he was teaching in Capernaum. 
\v 60 On hearing it, many of his disciples said, ‘This is harsh doctrine! Who can bear to listen to it?’ 
\v 61 But Jesus, aware that his disciples were murmuring about it, said to them, 
\v 62  \wj ‘\+w Is\+w* \+w this\+w* \+w a\+w* hindrance \+w to\+w* \+w you\+w*? \+w What\+w*, \+w then\+w*, \+w if\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w should\+w* \+w see\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Son\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Man\+w* ascending \+w where\+w* \+w he\+w* \+w was\+w* \+w before\+w*?\wj* 
\v 63  \wj \+w It\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Spirit\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w gives\+w* \+w life\+w*; \+w human\+w* strength achieves \+w nothing\+w*. \+w In\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w teaching\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w been\+w* giving \+w you\+w* \+w there\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w Spirit\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w there\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w life\+w*.\wj* 
\v 64  \wj \+w Yet\+w* \+w there\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w some\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w believe\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w me\+w*.’\wj* For Jesus knew from the first who they were that did not believe in him, and who it was that would betray him; 
\v 65 and he added, \wj ‘\+w This\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w why\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w told\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w no\+w* \+w one\+w* \+w can\+w* \+w come\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w me\+w*, \+w unless\+w* \+w enabled\+w* \+w by\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Father\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 66 After this many of his disciples drew back, and did not go about with him any longer. 
\v 67 So Jesus said to the Twelve, \wj ‘\+w Do\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w also\+w* \+w wish\+w* \+w to\+w* leave \+w me\+w*?’\wj* 
\v 68 But Simon Peter answered, ‘Master, to whom would we go? Eternal life is in your teaching; 
\v 69 and we have learned to believe and to know that you are the Holy One of God.’ 
\p
\v 70  \wj ‘Didn’\+w t\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w myself\+w* \+w choose\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Twelve\+w*?’\wj* replied Jesus, \wj ‘\+w and\+w* \+w yet\+w*, \+w even\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w you\+w*, \+w one\+w* \+w is\+w* playing \+w the\+w* \+w devil\+w*’s \+w part\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 71 He meant Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, who was about to betray him, though he was one of the Twelve. 
\c 7  
\b
\p
\v 1 After this, Jesus went about in Galilee, for he would not do so in Judea, because the religious authorities (in Jerusalem) were eager to put him to death. 
\v 2 When the Jewish Festival of Tabernacles was near, 
\v 3 his brothers said to him, ‘Leave this part of the country, and go into Judea, so that your disciples, as well as we, may see the work that you are doing. 
\v 4 For no one does a thing privately, if they are seeking to be widely known. Since you do these things, you should show yourself publicly to the world.’ 
\v 5 For even his brothers did not believe in him. 
\p
\v 6  \wj ‘\+w My\+w* \+w time\+w*,’\wj* answered Jesus, \wj ‘\+w is\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w come\+w* \+w yet\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w time\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w always\+w* \+w here\+w*.\wj* 
\v 7  \wj \+w The\+w* \+w world\+w* \+w cannot\+w* \+w hate\+w* \+w you\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w does\+w* \+w hate\+w* \+w me\+w*, \+w because\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w testify\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w its\+w* ways \+w are\+w* \+w evil\+w*.\wj*

\v 9 After telling them this, he stayed on in Galilee. 
\p
\v 10 But, when his brothers had gone up to the Festival, Jesus also went up – not publicly, but privately. 
\v 11 The authorities were looking for him at the Festival and asking “Where is he?”; 
\v 12 and there were many whispers about him among the people, some saying “He is a good man;” others, “No! He is leading the people astray.” 
\v 13 No one, however, spoke freely about him, because they were afraid of the authorities. 
\b
\p
\v 14 About the middle of the Festival week, Jesus went up into the Temple Courts, and began teaching. 
\v 15 The authorities were astonished. ‘How has this man got his learning,’ they asked, ‘when he has never studied?’ 
\v 16 So, in reply, Jesus said, \wj ‘\+w My\+w* \+w teaching\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w own\+w*; \+w it\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w his\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w sent\+w* \+w me\+w*.\wj*

\p
\v 20 ‘You must be possessed by a demon!’ the people exclaimed. ‘Who is seeking to put you to death?’ 
\p
\v 21  \wj ‘\+w There\+w* \+w was\+w* \+w one\+w* \+w thing\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w did\+w*,’\wj* replied Jesus, \wj ‘\+w at\+w* \+w which\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w all\+w* still \+w wondering\+w*.\wj*

\v 24  \wj \+w Do\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w judge\+w* \+w by\+w* appearances; \+w judge\+w* justly.’\wj* 
\v 25 At this some of the people of Jerusalem exclaimed, ‘Is not this the man who they are seeking to put to death? 
\v 26 Yet here he is, speaking out boldly, and they say nothing to him! Is it possible that our leading men have really discovered that he is the Christ? 
\v 27 Yet we know where this man is from; but, when the Christ comes, no one will be able to tell where he is from.’ 
\v 28 Therefore, Jesus, as he was teaching in the Temple Courts, raised his voice and said, \wj ‘Yes; \+w you\+w* \+w know\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w know\+w* \+w where\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w am\+w* \+w from\+w*. \+w Yet\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w come\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w own\+w* authority, \+w but\+w* \+w he\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w sent\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w may\+w* \+w be\+w* trusted; \+w and\+w* \+w him\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w know\+w*.\wj* 
\v 29  \wj \+w I\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w know\+w* him, \+w for\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w from\+w* him \+w that\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w come\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w he\+w* \+w sent\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w as\+w* \+w his\+w* messenger.’\wj* 
\v 30 So they sought to arrest him; but no one touched him, for his time was not come yet. 
\v 31 Many of the people, however, believed in him. ‘When the Christ comes,’ they said, ‘will he give more signs of his mission than this man has given?’ 
\v 32 The Pharisees heard the people whispering about him in this way, and so the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him; 
\v 33 at which Jesus said, \wj ‘\+w I\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w but\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w little\+w* \+w longer\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w then\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w am\+w* \+w going\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w him\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w sent\+w* \+w me\+w*.\wj*

\p
\v 35 ‘Where is this man going,’ the people asked one another, ‘that we would not find him? Will he go to our countrymen abroad, and teach foreigners? 
\v 36 What does he mean by saying \wj “\+w You\+w* \+w will\+w* look \+w for\+w* \+w me\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w find\+w* \+w me\+w*; \+w and\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w able\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w come\+w* \+w where\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w be\+w*”?’\wj* 
\b
\p
\v 37 On the last and greatest day of the Festival, Jesus, who was standing by, exclaimed, \wj ‘\+w If\+w* \+w anyone\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w thirsty\+w*, \+w they\+w* \+w should\+w* \+w come\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w drink\+w*.\wj* 
\v 38  \wj \+w From\+w* \+w the\+w* heart \+w of\+w* \+w those\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w believe\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w flow\+w*, \+w as\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w said\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w scripture\+w*, \+w rivers\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w living\+w* \+w water\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 39 (By this he meant the Spirit, which those who had believed in him were to receive; for the Spirit had not yet come, because Jesus had not yet been exalted.) 
\v 40 Some of the people, when they heard these words, said, ‘This is certainly the Prophet!’; 
\v 41 others said, ‘the Christ!’; but some asked, ‘What! Does the Christ come from Galilee? 
\v 42 Is not it said in scripture that it is of the descendants of David, and from Bethlehem, the village to which David belonged, that the Christ is to come?’ 
\v 43 So there was a sharp division among the people because of Jesus. 
\v 44 Some of them wanted to arrest him, and yet no one touched him. 
\v 45 When the officers returned to the chief priests and Pharisees, they were asked, ‘Why have you not brought him?’ 
\p
\v 46 ‘No one ever spoke as he speaks!’ they answered. 
\v 47 ‘What! Have you been led astray too?’ the Pharisees replied. 
\v 48 ‘Have any of our leading men believed in him, or any of the Pharisees? 
\v 49 As for these people who do not know the Law – they are cursed!’ 
\v 50 But one of their number, Nicodemus, who before this had been to see Jesus, said to them, 
\v 51 ‘Does our Law pass judgment on a person without first giving them a hearing, and finding out what they have been doing?’ 
\p
\v 52 ‘Are you also from Galilee?’ they retorted. ‘Search, and you will find that no prophet is to arise in Galilee!’ 
\b
\p
\v 53 And everyone went home 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1 except Jesus, who went to the Mount of Olives\f + \fr 8.1  \ft This passage is inserted in some manuscripts from an ancient source, and found either after John 7:53 or after Luke 21:38 or elsewhere.\f*. 
\v 2 But he went again into the Temple Courts early in the morning, and all the people came to him; and he sat down and taught them. 
\v 3 Presently, however, the Teachers of the Law and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery, and placed her in the middle of the Court, 
\v 4 and said to Jesus, ‘Teacher, this woman was found in the act of adultery. 
\v 5 Now Moses, in the Law, commanded us to stone such women to death; what do you say?’ 
\p
\v 6 They said this to test him, in order to have a charge to bring against him. But Jesus stooped down, and wrote on the ground with his finger. 
\v 7 However, as they continued asking him, he raised himself, and said, ‘Let the person among you who has never done wrong throw the first stone at her.’ 
\p
\v 8 And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground. 
\v 9 When they heard that, they went out one by one, beginning with the eldest; and Jesus was left alone with the woman in the middle of the Court. 
\v 10 Raising himself, Jesus said to her, ‘Woman, where are they? Did no one condemn you?’ 
\p
\v 11 ‘No one, Sir,’ she answered. 
\p ‘Neither do I condemn you,’ said Jesus ‘go, and do not sin again.’ 
\b
\p
\v 12 Jesus again addressed the people. \wj ‘\+w I\+w* \+w am\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w light\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w world\+w*,’\wj* he said. \wj ‘\+w The\+w* person \+w who\+w* \+w follows\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w walk\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w darkness\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w light\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w life\+w*.’\wj* 
\p
\v 13 ‘You are bearing testimony to yourself!’ exclaimed the Pharisees, ‘your testimony is not trustworthy.’ 
\p
\v 14  \wj ‘\+w Even\+w* \+w if\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w bear\+w* \+w testimony\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w myself\+w*,’\wj* answered Jesus, \wj ‘\+w my\+w* \+w testimony\+w* \+w is\+w* trustworthy; \+w for\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w know\+w* \+w where\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w came\+w* \+w from\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w where\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w am\+w* \+w going\+w*; \+w but\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w know\+w* \+w where\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w come\+w* \+w from\+w*, \+w nor\+w* \+w where\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w am\+w* \+w going\+w*.\wj*

\v 20 These statements Jesus made in the Treasury, while teaching in the Temple Courts. Yet no one arrested him, for his time had not then come.

\v 22 ‘Is he going to kill himself,’ the people exclaimed, ‘that he says – \wj “\+w You\+w* \+w cannot\+w* \+w go\+w* \+w where\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w am\+w* \+w going\+w*”?’\wj*

\p
\v 25 ‘Who are you?’ they asked. \wj ‘\+w Why\+w* \+w ask\+w* exactly \+w what\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w been\+w* \+w telling\+w* \+w you\+w*?’\wj* said Jesus.

\v 27 They did not understand that he meant the Father.

\p
\v 1 As Jesus passed by, he saw a man who had been blind from his birth. 
\v 2 ‘Rabbi,’ asked his disciples, ‘who was it that sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?’ 
\p
\v 3  \wj ‘\+w Neither\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w man\+w* \+w nor\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w parents\+w*,’\wj* replied Jesus, \wj ‘\+w but\+w* \+w he\+w* \+w was\+w* born blind \+w so\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w work\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w God\+w* \+w should\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w made\+w* plain \+w in\+w* \+w him\+w*.\wj* 
\v 4  \wj \+w We\+w* \+w must\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w work\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w him\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w sent\+w* \+w me\+w*, \+w while\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w day\+w*; \+w night\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w coming\+w*, \+w when\+w* \+w no\+w* \+w one\+w* \+w can\+w* \+w work\+w*.\wj* 
\v 5  \wj \+w As\+w* long \+w as\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w am\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w world\+w*, \+w I\+w* \+w am\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w light\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w world\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 6 Saying this, Jesus spat on the ground, made some paste with the saliva, and put it on the man’s eyes. 
\v 7  \wj ‘\+w Go\+w*,’\wj* he said, \wj ‘\+w and\+w* \+w wash\+w* \+w your\+w* eyes \+w in\+w* \+w the\+w* Bath \+w of\+w* \+w Siloam\+w*’\wj* (a word which means “messenger”). So the man went and washed his eyes, and returned able to see. 
\v 8 His neighbours, and those who had formerly known him by sight as a beggar, exclaimed, ‘Is not this the man who used to sit and beg?’ 
\p
\v 9 ‘Yes,’ some said, ‘it is’; while others said, ‘No, but he is like him.’ The man himself said, ‘I am he.’ 
\p
\v 10 ‘How did you get your sight, then?’ they asked. 
\v 11 ‘The man whom they call Jesus,’ he answered, ‘made a paste, and anointed my eyes, and said to me \wj “\+w Go\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w Siloam\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w wash\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w eyes\+w*.”\wj* So I went and washed my eyes, and gained my sight.’ 
\p
\v 12 ‘Where is he?’ they asked. ‘I do not know,’ he answered. 
\v 13 They took the man, who had been blind, to the Pharisees. 
\v 14 Now it was a Sabbath when Jesus made the paste and gave him his sight. 
\v 15 So the Pharisees also questioned the man as to how he had gained his sight. ‘He put a paste on my eyes,’ he answered, ‘and I washed them, and I can see.’ 
\p
\v 16 ‘The man cannot be from God,’ said some of the Pharisees, ‘for he does not keep the Sabbath.’ 
\p ‘How is it possible,’ retorted others, ‘for a bad man to give signs like this?’ 
\v 17 So there was a difference of opinion among them, and they again questioned the man. ‘What do you yourself say about him, for it is to you that he has given sight?’ 
\v 18 The religious authorities, however, refused to believe that he had been blind and had gained his sight, until they had called his parents and questioned them. 
\v 19 ‘Is this your son,’ they asked, ‘who you say was born blind? If so, how is it that he can see now?’ 
\p
\v 20 ‘We know that this is our son,’ answered the parents, ‘and that he was born blind; 
\v 21 but how it is that he can see now we do not know; nor do we know who it was that gave him his sight. Ask him – he is old enough – he will tell you about himself.’ 
\v 22 His parents spoke in this way because they were afraid of the authorities; for the authorities had already agreed that, if anyone should acknowledge Jesus as the Christ, he should be expelled from their synagogues. 
\v 23 This was why his parents said “He is old enough; ask him.” 
\v 24 So the authorities again called the man who had been blind, and said to him, ‘Give God the praise; we know that this is a bad man.’ 
\p
\v 25 ‘I know nothing about his being a bad man,’ he replied. ‘One thing I do know, that although I was blind, now I can see.’ 
\p
\v 26 ‘What did he do to you?’ they asked. ‘How did he give you your sight?’ 
\p
\v 27 ‘I told you just now,’ he answered, ‘and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Surely you also do not want to become his disciples?’ 
\p
\v 28 ‘You are his disciple,’ they retorted scornfully. ‘But we are disciples of Moses. 
\v 29 We know that God spoke to Moses; but, as for this man, we do not know where he comes from.’ 
\p
\v 30 ‘Well,’ the man replied, ‘this is very strange; you do not know where he comes from, and yet he has given me my sight! 
\v 31 We know that God never listens to bad people, but, when a person is god-fearing and does God’s will, God listens to them. 
\v 32 Since the world began, such a thing was never heard of as anyone’s giving sight to a person born blind. 
\v 33 If this man had not been from God, he could not have done anything at all.’ 
\p
\v 34 ‘You,’ they retorted, ‘were born totally depraved; and are you trying to teach us?’ So they expelled him. 
\v 35 Jesus heard of their having put him out; and, when he had found the man, he asked, \wj ‘\+w Do\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w believe\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Son\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Man\+w*?’\wj* 
\p

\v 38 ‘Then, Sir, I do believe,’ said the man, bowing to the ground before him;

\v 19 In consequence of these words a difference of opinion again arose among the people. 
\v 20 Many of them said, ‘He is possessed by a demon and is mad; why do you listen to him?’

\v 22 Soon after this the Festival of the Rededication was held at Jerusalem. 
\v 23 It was winter; and Jesus was walking in the Temple Courts, in the Colonnade of Solomon,

\v 31 Some of the people again brought stones to throw at him; 
\v 32 and seeing this, Jesus said, \wj ‘\+w I\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w done\+w* \+w before\+w* \+w your\+w* eyes \+w many\+w* \+w good\+w* \+w actions\+w*, \+w inspired\+w* \+w by\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Father\+w*; \+w for\+w* \+w which\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w them\+w* would \+w you\+w* \+w stone\+w* \+w me\+w*?’\wj*

\p
\v 40 Then Jesus again crossed the Jordan to the place where John used to baptize at first, and stayed there some time, during which many people came to see him. 
\v 41 ‘John gave no sign of his mission,’ they said. ‘But everything that he said about this man was true.’ 
\v 42 And many learned to believe in Jesus there.

\v 1 Now a man named Lazarus, of Bethany, was lying ill; he belonged to the same village as Mary and her sister Martha. 
\v 2 This Mary, whose brother Lazarus was ill, was the Mary who anointed the Master with perfume, and wiped his feet with her hair. 
\v 3 The sisters, therefore, sent this message to Jesus – “Master, your friend is ill”; 
\v 4 and, when Jesus heard it, he said, \wj ‘\+w This\+w* illness \+w is\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w end\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w death\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w to\+w* redound \+w to\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w honour\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w God\+w*, \+w in\+w* \+w order\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Son\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w God\+w* \+w may\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w honoured\+w* \+w through\+w* \+w it\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 5 Jesus loved Martha and her sister, and Lazarus. 
\v 6 Yet, when he heard of the illness of Lazarus, he still stayed two days in the place where he was. 
\v 7 Then, after that, he said to his disciples, \wj ‘\+w Let\+w* \+w us\+w* \+w go\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w Judea\+w* \+w again\+w*.’\wj*

\v 8 ‘Rabbi,’ they replied, ‘the authorities there were but just now seeking to stone you; and are you going there again?’

\v 9  \wj ‘\+w Are\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w there\+w* \+w twelve\+w* \+w hours\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w day\+w*?’\wj* answered Jesus. \wj ‘\+w If\+w* \+w someone\+w* \+w walks\+w* \+w about\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w daytime\+w*, \+w they\+w* don’\+w t\+w* \+w stumble\+w*, \+w because\+w* \+w they\+w* can see \+w the\+w* \+w light\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* sun;\wj*

\v 11 And, when he had said this, he added, \wj ‘\+w Our\+w* \+w friend\+w* \+w Lazarus\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w fallen\+w* \+w asleep\+w*; \+w but\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w am\+w* \+w going\+w* \+w so\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w may\+w* wake \+w him\+w*.’\wj* 
\p
\v 12 ‘If he has fallen asleep, Master, he will get well,’ said the disciples. 
\v 13 But Jesus meant that he was dead; they, however, supposed that he was speaking of natural sleep. 
\v 14 Then he said to them plainly, \wj ‘\+w Lazarus\+w* \+w is\+w* dead;\wj* 
\v 15  \wj \+w and\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w am\+w* \+w glad\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w sakes\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w was\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w there\+w*, \+w so\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w may\+w* learn \+w to\+w* \+w believe\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w me\+w*. \+w But\+w* \+w let\+w* us \+w go\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w him\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 16 At this, Thomas, who was called “The Twin,” said to his fellow disciples, ‘Let us go too, so that we may die with him.’ 
\v 17 When Jesus reached the place, he found that Lazarus had been four days in the tomb already. 
\v 18 Bethany being only about two miles from Jerusalem, 
\v 19 a number of the people had come there to comfort Martha and Mary because of their brother’s death. 
\v 20 When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went to meet him; but Mary sat quietly at home. 
\v 21 ‘Master,’ Martha said to Jesus, ‘if you had been here, my brother would not have died. 
\v 22 Even now, I know that God will grant you whatever you ask him.’ 
\p
\v 23  \wj ‘\+w Your\+w* brother \+w will\+w* rise \+w to\+w* life,’\wj* said Jesus. 
\v 24 ‘I know that he will,’ replied Martha, ‘in the resurrection at the Last day.’

\v 25  \wj ‘\+w I\+w* \+w am\+w* \+w the\+w* resurrection \+w and\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w life\+w*,’\wj* said Jesus. \wj ‘\+w He\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w believes\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w live\+w*, \+w though\+w* \+w he\+w* die;\wj*

\v 27 ‘Yes Master,’ she answered. ‘I have learned to believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.’ 
\v 28 After saying this, Martha went and called her sister Mary, and whispered, ‘The teacher is here, and is asking for you.’ 
\v 29 As soon as Mary heard that, she got up quickly, and went to meet him. 
\v 30 Jesus had not then come into the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met him. 
\v 31 So the people, who were in the house with Mary, comforting her, when they saw her get up quickly and go out, followed her, thinking that she was going to the tomb to weep there. 
\v 32 When Mary came where Jesus was and saw him, she threw herself at his feet. ‘Master,’ she exclaimed, ‘if you had been here, my brother would not have died!’ 
\v 33 When Jesus saw her weeping, and the people who had come with her weeping also, he groaned deeply, and was greatly distressed. 
\v 34  \wj ‘\+w Where\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w you\+w* buried \+w him\+w*?’\wj* he asked. ‘Come and see, Master,’ they answered. 
\v 35 Jesus burst into tears. 
\v 36 ‘How he must have loved him!’ the people exclaimed; 
\v 37 but some of them said, ‘Could not this man, who gave sight to the blind man, have also prevented Lazarus from dying?’ 
\v 38 Again groaning inwardly, Jesus came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay against the mouth of it. 
\v 39  \wj ‘Move \+w the\+w* \+w stone\+w* away,’\wj* said Jesus. ‘Master,’ said Martha, the sister of the dead man, ‘by this time the smell must be offensive, for this is the fourth day since his death.’ 
\p
\v 40  \wj ‘Didn’\+w t\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w*,’\wj* replied Jesus, \wj ‘\+w that\+w*, \+w if\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w would\+w* \+w believe\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w me\+w*, \+w you\+w* \+w should\+w* \+w see\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w glory\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w God\+w*?’\wj* 
\v 41 So they moved the stone away; and Jesus, with uplifted eyes, said, \wj ‘\+w Father\+w*, \+w I\+w* \+w thank\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w have\+w* heard \+w my\+w* prayer;\wj* 
\v 42  \wj \+w I\+w* \+w know\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w always\+w* hear \+w me\+w*; \+w but\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w say\+w* \+w this\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w sake\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w people\+w* \+w standing\+w* near, \+w so\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w they\+w* \+w may\+w* \+w believe\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w has\+w* sent \+w me\+w* \+w as\+w* \+w your\+w* messenger.’\wj* 
\p
\v 43 Then, after saying this, Jesus called in a loud voice, \wj ‘\+w Lazarus\+w*! \+w Come\+w* \+w out\+w*!’\wj* 
\v 44 The dead man came out, wrapped hand and foot in a winding-sheet; his face, too, had been wrapped in a cloth. \wj ‘\+w Set\+w* \+w him\+w* \+w free\+w*,’\wj* said Jesus, \wj ‘\+w and\+w* \+w let\+w* \+w him\+w* \+w go\+w*.’\wj* 
\b
\p
\v 45 In consequence of this, many of the people, who had come to visit Mary and had seen what Jesus did, put their faith in him. 
\v 46 Some of them, however, went to the Pharisees, and told them what he had done. 
\v 47 The chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the High Council, and said, ‘What are we to do, now that this man is giving so many signs? 
\v 48 If we allow him to continue as we are doing, everyone will believe in him; and the Romans will come and will take from us both our Temple and our nation.’ 
\v 49 One of them, however, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, 
\v 50 ‘You are utterly mistaken. You do not consider that it is better for you that one person should die for the people, rather than the whole nation should be destroyed.’ 
\v 51 Now he did not say this of his own accord; but, as high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was to die for the nation – 
\v 52 And not for the nation only, but also that he might unite in one body the children of God now scattered far and wide. 
\v 53 So from that day they plotted to put Jesus to death. 
\b
\p
\v 54 In consequence of this, Jesus did not go about publicly among the people any more, but left and went into the country bordering on the wilderness, to a town called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples. 
\v 55 But the Jewish Festival of the Passover was near; and many people had gone up from the country to Jerusalem, for their purification, before the Festival began. 
\v 56 So they looked for Jesus there, and said to one another, as they stood in the Temple Courts, ‘What do you think? Do you think he will come to the Festival?’ 
\v 57 The chief priests and the Pharisees had already issued orders that, if anyone learned where Jesus was, he should give information, so that they might arrest him. 
\c 12  
\s1 The Last Days 
\p
\v 1 Six days before the Passover Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead, was living. 
\v 2 There a supper was given in his honour at which Martha waited, while Lazarus was one of those present at the table. 
\v 3 So Mary took a pound of choice spikenard perfume of great value, and anointed the feet of Jesus with it, and then wiped them with her hair. The whole house was filled with the scent of the perfume. 
\v 4 One of the disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was about to betray Jesus, asked, 
\v 5 ‘Why was not this perfume sold for a year’s wages, and the money given to poor people?’ 
\v 6 He said this, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and, being in charge of the purse, used to take what was put in it. 
\v 7  \wj ‘Leave \+w her\+w* \+w alone\+w*,’\wj* said Jesus, \wj ‘\+w so\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w she\+w* \+w may\+w* \+w keep\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w until\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w day\+w* \+w when\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w body\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w being\+w* prepared \+w for\+w* \+w burial\+w*.\wj* 
\v 8  \wj \+w The\+w* \+w poor\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w always\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w you\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w always\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w me\+w*.’\wj* 
\p
\v 9 Now great numbers of people found out that Jesus was at Bethany; and they came there, not only because of him, but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. 
\v 10 The chief priests, however, plotted to put Lazarus, as well as Jesus, to death, 
\v 11 because it was owing to him that many of the people had left them, and were becoming believers in Jesus. 
\v 12 On the following day great numbers of people who had come to the Festival, hearing that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem, took palm branches, 
\v 13 and went out to meet him, shouting as they went, ‘God save him! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord – the king of Israel!’ 
\v 14 Having found a young donkey, Jesus seated himself on it, in accordance with the passage of scripture – 
\v 15 “Fear not, people of Zion. Your king is coming to you, sitting on the foal of a donkey.” 
\v 16 His disciples did not understand all this at first; but, when Jesus had been exalted, then they remembered that these things had been said of him in scripture, and that they had done these things for him. 
\v 17 Meanwhile the people who were with him, when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead, were telling what they had seen. 
\v 18 This, indeed, was why the crowd met him – because people had heard that he had given this sign of his mission. 
\v 19 So the Pharisees said to one another, ‘You see that you are gaining nothing! Why, all the world has run after him!’ 
\b
\p
\v 20 Among those who were going up to worship at the Festival were some Greeks, 
\v 21 who went to Philip of Bethsaida in Galilee, and said, ‘Sir, we wish to see Jesus.’ 
\v 22 Philip went and told Andrew, and then together they went and told Jesus. 
\v 23 This was his reply – \wj ‘\+w The\+w* \+w time\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w come\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Son\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Man\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w be\+w* exalted.\wj*

\v 29 The crowd of bystanders, who heard the sound, said that it was thundering. Others said, ‘An angel has been speaking to him.’ 
\p
\v 30  \wj ‘\+w It\+w* \+w was\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w sake\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w voice\+w* \+w came\+w*,’\wj* said Jesus, \wj ‘\+w but\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w yours\+w*.\wj* 
\v 31  \wj \+w Now\+w* \+w this\+w* \+w world\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w on\+w* its trial. \+w Now\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Spirit\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w is\+w* ruling \+w this\+w* \+w world\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w driven\+w* \+w out\+w*;\wj*

\v 33 By these words he indicated what death he was destined to die. 
\v 34 ‘We,’ replied the people, ‘have learned from the Law that the Christ is to remain for ever; how is it, then, that you say that the Son of Man must be \wj “\+w lifted\+w* \+w up\+w*”\wj* Who is this “Son of Man”?’ 
\p
\v 35  \wj ‘\+w Only\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w little\+w* \+w while\+w* \+w longer\+w*,’\wj* answered Jesus, \wj ‘\+w will\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w light\+w* \+w among\+w* \+w you\+w*.

\v 37 But, though Jesus had given so many signs of his mission before their eyes, they still did not believe in him, 
\v 38 in fulfilment of the words of the prophet Isaiah, where he says – “Lord, who has believed our teaching? And to whom has the might of the Lord been revealed?” 
\v 39 The reason why they were unable to believe is given by Isaiah elsewhere, in these words – 
\v 40 “He has blinded their eyes, and blunted their mind, so that they should not see with their eyes, and perceive with their mind, and turn – And I should heal them.” 
\v 41 Isaiah said this, because he saw Christ’s glory; and it was of him that he spoke. 
\v 42 Yet for all this, even among the leading men there were many who came to believe in Jesus; but, because of the Pharisees, they did not acknowledge it, because they were afraid that they should be expelled from their synagogues; 
\v 43 for they valued honour from people more than honour from God. 
\v 44 But Jesus had proclaimed, \wj ‘\+w He\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w believes\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w believes\+w*, \+w not\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w me\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w him\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w sent\+w* \+w me\+w*;\wj*

\p
\v 1 Before the Passover Festival began, Jesus knew that the time had come for him to leave the world and go to the Father. He had loved those who were his own in the world, and he loved them to the last. 
\v 2 The devil had already put the thought of betraying Jesus into the mind of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon; 
\v 3 and at supper, Jesus – although knowing that the Father had put everything into his hands, and that he had come from God, and was to return to God – 
\v 4 rose from his place, and, taking off his upper garments, tied a towel round his waist. 
\v 5 He then poured some water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe them with the towel which was tied round him. 
\v 6 When he came to Simon Peter, Peter said, ‘You, Master! Are you going to wash my feet?’ 
\p
\v 7  \wj ‘\+w You\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w understand\+w* \+w now\+w* \+w what\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w am\+w* \+w doing\+w*,’\wj* replied Jesus, \wj ‘\+w but\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w learn\+w* \+w by\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w by\+w*.’\wj* 
\p
\v 8 ‘You will never wash my feet!’ exclaimed Peter. \wj ‘\+w Unless\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w wash\+w* \+w you\+w*,’\wj* answered Jesus, \wj ‘\+w you\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w nothing\+w* \+w in\+w* common \+w with\+w* \+w me\+w*.’\wj* 
\p
\v 9 ‘Then, Master, not my feet only,’ exclaimed Simon Peter, ‘but also my hands and my head.’ 
\p
\v 10  \wj ‘\+w He\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w bathed\+w*,’\wj* replied Jesus, \wj ‘\+w has\+w* \+w no\+w* \+w need\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w wash\+w*, \+w unless\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w his\+w* \+w feet\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w altogether\+w* \+w clean\+w*; \+w and\+w* \+w you\+w*,’\wj* he said to the disciples, \wj ‘\+w are\+w* \+w clean\+w*, \+w yet\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w all\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w you\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 11 For he knew who was going to betray him, and that was why he said \wj “\+w You\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w all\+w* \+w clean\+w*.”\wj* 
\v 12 When he had washed their feet, and had put on his upper garments and taken his place, he spoke to them again. \wj ‘\+w Do\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w understand\+w* \+w what\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w been\+w* \+w doing\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w you\+w*?’\wj* he asked.

\v 22 The disciples looked at one another, wondering whom he meant. 
\v 23 Next to Jesus, in the place on his right hand, was one of his disciples, whom he loved. 
\v 24 So Simon Peter made signs to that disciple, and whispered, ‘Tell me who it is that he means.’ 
\v 25 Being in this position, that disciple leant back on Jesus’ shoulder, and asked him, ‘Who is it, Master?’

\v 28 But no one at the table understood why he said this to Judas. 
\v 29 Some thought that, as Judas kept the purse, Jesus meant that he was to buy some things needed for the Festival, or to give something to the poor. 
\v 30 After taking the piece of bread, Judas went out immediately; and it was night.

\c  18  
\b
\p
\v 1 When Jesus had said this, he went out with his disciples and crossed the Kidron ravine to a place where there was a garden, into which he and his disciples went. 
\v 2 The place was well known to Judas, the betrayer, for Jesus and his disciples had often met there. 
\v 3 So Judas, who had obtained the soldiers of the Roman garrison, and some guards from the chief priests and the Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons. 
\v 4 Jesus, aware of all that was coming upon him, went to meet them, and said to them, \wj ‘\+w For\+w* \+w whom\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w looking\+w*?’\wj* 
\p
\v 5 ‘Jesus of Nazareth,’ was their answer. \wj ‘\+w I\+w* \+w am\+w* \+w he\+w*,’\wj* said Jesus. (Judas, the betrayer, was also standing with them.) 
\v 6 When Jesus said \wj “\+w I\+w* \+w am\+w* \+w he\+w*,”\wj* they drew back and fell to the ground. 
\v 7 So he again asked for whom they were looking, and they answered, ‘Jesus of Nazareth.’ 
\p
\v 8  \wj ‘\+w I\+w* \+w have\+w* already \+w told\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w am\+w* \+w he\+w*,’\wj* replied Jesus, \wj ‘\+w so\+w*, \+w if\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w looking\+w*, \+w let\+w* \+w these\+w* \+w people\+w* \+w go\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 9 This was in fulfilment of his words – \wj “\+w Of\+w* \+w those\+w* \+w whom\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w given\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w not\+w* lost \+w one\+w*.”\wj* 
\v 10 At this, Simon Peter, who had a sword with him, drew it, and struck the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus. 
\v 11 But Jesus said to Peter, \wj ‘Sheathe \+w your\+w* \+w sword\+w*. \+w Should\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w drink\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w cup\+w* \+w which\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Father\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w given\+w* \+w me\+w*?’\wj* 
\b
\p
\v 12 So the soldiers of the garrison, with their commanding officer and the Jewish guards, arrested Jesus and bound him, 
\v 13 and took him first of all to Annas. Annas was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year. 
\v 14 It was Caiaphas who had counselled the religious authorities, that it was best that one person should die for the people. 
\v 15 Meanwhile Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. That disciple, being well-known to the high priest, went with Jesus into the high priest’s courtyard, 
\v 16 while Peter stood outside by the door. Presently the other disciple – the one well-known to the high priest – went out and spoke to the portress, and brought Peter in. 
\v 17 So the maidservant said to Peter, ‘Aren’t you also one of this man’s disciples?’ 
\p ‘No, I am not,’ he said. 
\v 18 The servants and guards were standing round a charcoal fire (which they had made because it was cold), and were warming themselves. Peter, too, was with them, standing and warming himself. 
\v 19 The high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching. 
\v 20  \wj ‘\+w For\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w part\+w*,’\wj* answered Jesus, \wj ‘\+w I\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w spoken\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w all\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w world\+w* \+w openly\+w*. \+w I\+w* \+w always\+w* \+w taught\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w some\+w* \+w synagogue\+w*, \+w or\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Temple\+w* Courts, places \+w where\+w* \+w everyone\+w* \+w assembles\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w never\+w* \+w spoke\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w anything\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w secret\+w*.\wj* 
\v 21  \wj \+w Why\+w* \+w question\+w* \+w me\+w*? \+w Question\+w* \+w those\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w have\+w* listened \+w to\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w as\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w what\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w spoken\+w* \+w about\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w them\+w*. \+w They\+w* \+w must\+w* \+w know\+w* \+w what\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w said\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 22 When Jesus said this, one of the guards, who was standing near, gave him a blow with his hand. ‘Do you answer the high priest like that?’ he exclaimed. 
\v 23  \wj ‘\+w If\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w said\+w* \+w anything\+w* \+w wrong\+w*, \+w give\+w* evidence \+w about\+w* \+w it\+w*,’\wj* replied Jesus, \wj ‘\+w but\+w* \+w if\+w* \+w not\+w*, \+w why\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w strike\+w* \+w me\+w*?’\wj* 
\v 24 Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest. 
\v 25 Meanwhile Simon Peter was standing there, warming himself; so they said to him, ‘Aren’t you also one of his disciples?’ Peter denied it. ‘No, I am not,’ he said. 
\v 26 One of the high priest’s servants, a relation of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, exclaimed, ‘Didn’t I myself see you with him in the garden?’ 
\v 27 Peter again denied it; and at that moment a cock crowed. 
\b
\p
\v 28 From Caiaphas they took Jesus to the Government house. It was early in the morning. But they did not enter the Government house themselves, otherwise they might become defiled, and so be unable to eat the Passover. 
\v 29 Therefore Pilate came outside to speak to them. ‘What charge do you bring against this man?’ he asked. 
\v 30 ‘If he had not been a criminal, we should not have given him up to you,’ they answered. 
\v 31 ‘Take him yourselves,’ said Pilate, ‘and try him by your own Law.’ 
\p ‘We have no power to put anyone to death,’ the authorities replied – 
\v 32 in fulfilment of what Jesus had said when indicating the death that he was destined to die. 
\v 33 After that, Pilate went into the Government house again, and calling Jesus up, asked him, ‘Are you the king of the Jews?’ 
\p
\v 34  \wj ‘\+w Do\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w ask\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w yourself\+w*?’\wj* replied Jesus, \wj ‘\+w or\+w* \+w did\+w* others \+w say\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w about\+w* \+w me\+w*?’\wj* 
\p
\v 35 ‘Do you take me for a Jew?’ was Pilate’s answer. ‘It is your own nation and the chief priests who have given you up to me. What have you done?’ 
\p
\v 36  \wj ‘\+w My\+w* kingly power,’\wj* replied Jesus, \wj ‘\+w is\+w* \+w not\+w* due \+w to\+w* \+w this\+w* \+w world\+w*. \+w If\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w had\+w* \+w been\+w* \+w so\+w*, \+w my\+w* \+w servants\+w* \+w would\+w* \+w be\+w* doing \+w their\+w* utmost \+w to\+w* prevent \+w my\+w* \+w being\+w* \+w given\+w* \+w up\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w the\+w* authorities; \+w but\+w* \+w my\+w* kingly power \+w is\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w from\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w world\+w*.’\wj* 
\p
\v 37 ‘So you are a king after all!’ exclaimed Pilate. \wj ‘Yes, \+w it\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w true\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w am\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w king\+w*,’\wj* answered Jesus. \wj ‘\+w I\+w* \+w was\+w* \+w born\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w this\+w*, \+w I\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w come\+w* \+w into\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w world\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w this\+w* – \+w to\+w* \+w bear\+w* \+w testimony\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w the\+w* truth. \+w Everyone\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w side\+w* \+w of\+w* truth listens \+w to\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w voice\+w*.’\wj* 
\p
\v 38 ‘What is truth?’ exclaimed Pilate. After saying this, he went out to the crowd again, and said, ‘For my part, I find nothing with which he can be charged. 
\v 39 It is, however, the custom for me to grant you the release of one man at the Passover Festival. Do you wish for the release of the king of the Jews?’ 
\p
\v 40 ‘No, not this man,’ they shouted again, ‘but Barabbas!’ This Barabbas was a robber. 
\c 19  
\b
\p
\v 1 After that, Pilate had Jesus scourged. 
\v 2 The soldiers made a crown with some thorns and put it on his head and threw a purple robe round him. 
\v 3 They kept coming up to him and saying, ‘Long live the king of the Jews!’ and they gave him blow after blow with their hands. 
\v 4 Pilate again came outside, and said to the people, ‘Look! I am bringing him out to you, so that you may know that I find nothing with which he can be charged.’ 
\v 5 Then Jesus came outside, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe; and Pilate said to them, ‘Here is the man!’ 
\v 6 When the chief priests and the guards saw him, they shouted, ‘Crucify him! Crucify him!’ 
\p ‘Take him yourselves and crucify him,’ said Pilate. ‘For my part, I find nothing with which he can be charged.’ 
\p
\v 7 ‘But we,’ replied the crowd, ‘have a Law, under which he deserves death for making himself out to be the Son of God.’ 
\v 8 When Pilate heard what they said, he became still more alarmed; 
\v 9 and, going into the Government house again, he said to Jesus, ‘Where do you come from?’ 
\v 10 But Jesus made no reply. So Pilate said to him, ‘Do you refuse to speak to me? Don’t you know that I have power to release you, and have power to crucify you?’ 
\p
\v 11  \wj ‘\+w You\+w* \+w would\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w no\+w* \+w power\+w* \+w over\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w at\+w* \+w all\+w*,’\wj* answered Jesus, \wj ‘\+w if\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w had\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w been\+w* \+w given\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w from\+w* above; \+w and\+w*, \+w therefore\+w*, \+w the\+w* \+w man\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w betrayed\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w is\+w* guilty \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w greater\+w* sin.’\wj* 
\v 12 This made Pilate anxious to release him; but the crowd shouted, ‘If you release that man, you are no friend of the Emperor! Anyone who makes himself out to be a king is setting himself against the Emperor!’ 
\v 13 On hearing what they said, Pilate brought Jesus out, and took his seat on the Bench at a place called “The Stone Pavement” – in Hebrew “Gabbatha.” 
\v 14 It was the Passover Preparation day, and about noon. Then he said to the crowd, ‘Here is your king!’ 
\v 15 At that the people shouted, ‘Kill him! Kill him! Crucify him!’ 
\p ‘What! Should I crucify your king?’ exclaimed Pilate. ‘We have no king but the Emperor,’ replied the chief priests; 
\v 16 so Pilate gave Jesus up to them to be crucified. 
\b
\p So they took Jesus; 
\v 17 and he went out, carrying his cross himself, to the place which is named from a skull, or, in Hebrew, Golgotha. 
\v 18 There they crucified him, and two others with him – one on each side, and Jesus between them. 
\v 19 Pilate also had these words written and put up over the cross – “JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.” 
\v 20 These words were read by many people, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and they were written in Hebrew, Latin and Greek. 
\v 21 The chief priests said to Pilate, ‘Do not write “The king of the Jews”, but write what the man said – “I am the king of the Jews.”’ 
\v 22 But Pilate answered, ‘What I have written, I have written.’ 
\b
\p
\v 23 When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them into four shares – a share for each soldier – and they took the coat also. The coat had no seam, being woven in one piece from top to bottom. 
\v 24 So they said to one another, ‘Do not let us tear it, but let us cast lots for it, to see who will have it.’ This was in fulfilment of the words of scripture – 
\q1 “They shared my clothes among them, 
\q2 and over my clothing they cast lots.” 
\m That was what the soldiers did. 
\v 25 Meanwhile near the cross of Jesus were standing his mother and his mother’s sister, as well as Mary the wife of Clopas and Mary of Magdala. 
\v 26 When Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved, standing near, he said to his mother, \wj ‘\+w There\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w son\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 27 Then he said to that disciple, \wj ‘\+w There\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w mother\+w*.’\wj* And from that very hour the disciple took her to live in his house. 
\b
\p
\v 28 Afterwards, knowing that everything was now finished, Jesus said, in fulfilment of the words of scripture, \wj ‘\+w I\+w* \+w am\+w* \+w thirsty\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 29 There was a bowl standing there full of common wine; so they put a sponge soaked in the wine on the end of a hyssop-stalk, and held it up to his mouth. 
\v 30 When Jesus had received the wine, he exclaimed, \wj ‘\+w All\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w finished\+w*!’\wj* Then, bowing his head, he resigned his spirit to God. 
\v 31 It was the Preparation day, and so, to prevent the bodies from remaining on the crosses during the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a great day), the Jews asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies removed. 
\v 32 Accordingly the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man, and then those of the other who had been crucified with Jesus; 
\v 33 but, on coming to him, when they saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. 
\v 34 One of the soldiers, however, pierced his side with a spear, and blood and water immediately flowed from it. 
\v 35 This is the statement of one who actually saw it – and his statement may be relied on, and he knows that he is speaking the truth – and it is given in order that you also may be convinced. 
\v 36 For all this happened in fulfilment of the words of scripture – “Not one of its bones will be broken.” 
\v 37 And there is another passage which says – “They will look on him whom they pierced.” 
\v 38 After this, Joseph of Arimathea, a disciple of Jesus – but a secret one, owing to his fear of the religious authorities – begged Pilate’s permission to remove the body of Jesus. Pilate gave him leave; so Joseph went and removed the body. 
\v 39 Nicodemus, too – the man who had formerly visited Jesus by night – came with a roll of myrrh and aloes, weighing nearly a hundred pounds. 
\v 40 They took the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen with the spices, according to the Jewish mode of burial. 
\v 41 At the place where Jesus had been crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a newly made tomb in which no one had ever been laid. 
\v 42 And so, because of its being the Preparation day, and as the tomb was close at hand, they laid Jesus there. 
\c 20  
\s1 The Risen Life 
\p
\v 1 On the first day of the week, early in the morning, while it was still dark, Mary of Magdala went to the tomb, and saw that the stone had been removed. 
\v 2 So she came running to Simon Peter, and to that other disciple who was Jesus’ friend, and said to them, ‘They have taken away the Master out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him!’ 
\v 3 So, Peter started off with that other disciple, and they went to the tomb. 
\v 4 The two began running together; but the other disciple ran faster than Peter, and reached the tomb first. 
\v 5 Stooping down, he saw the linen wrappings lying there, but did not go in. 
\v 6 Presently Simon Peter came following behind him, and went into the tomb; and he looked at the linen wrappings lying there, 
\v 7 and the cloth which had been on Jesus’ head, not lying with the wrappings, but rolled up on one side, separately. 
\v 8 Then the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, went inside too, and he saw for himself and was convinced. 
\v 9 For they did not then understand the passage of scripture which says that Jesus must rise again from the dead. 
\v 10 The disciples then returned to their companions. 
\p
\v 11 Meanwhile Mary was standing close outside the tomb, weeping. Still weeping, she leant forward into the tomb, 
\v 12 and perceived two angels clothed in white sitting there, where the body of Jesus had been lying, one where the head and the other where the feet had been. 
\v 13 ‘Why are you weeping?’ asked the angels. ‘They have taken my Master away,’ she answered, ‘and I do not know where they have laid him.’ 
\v 14 After saying this, she turned round, and looked at Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus. 
\v 15  \wj ‘\+w Why\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w weeping\+w*? \+w Whom\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w seeking\+w*?’\wj* he asked. Supposing him to be the gardener, Mary answered, ‘If it was you, Sir, who carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away myself.’ 
\p
\v 16  \wj ‘\+w Mary\+w*!’\wj* said Jesus. She turned round, and exclaimed in Hebrew, ‘Rabboni!’ (or, as we should say, “teacher”). 
\v 17  \wj ‘\+w Do\+w* \+w not\+w* hold \+w me\+w*,’\wj* Jesus said, \wj ‘\+w for\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w yet\+w* \+w ascended\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Father\+w*. \+w But\+w* \+w go\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w my\+w* brothers, \+w and\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w them\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w am\+w* ascending \+w to\+w* \+w him\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w Father\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w their\+w* \+w Father\+w*, \+w my\+w* \+w God\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w their\+w* \+w God\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 18 Mary of Magdala went and told the disciples that she had seen the Master, and that he had said this to her. 
\b
\p
\v 19 In the evening of the same day – the first day of the week – after the doors of the room, in which the disciples were, had been shut because they were afraid of the religious authorities, Jesus came and stood among them and said, \wj ‘\+w Peace\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w you\+w*’;\wj* 
\v 20 after which he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples were filled with joy when they saw the Master. 
\v 21 Again Jesus said to them, \wj ‘\+w Peace\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w you\+w*. \+w As\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Father\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w sent\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w as\+w* \+w his\+w* messenger, \+w so\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w am\+w* \+w sending\+w* \+w you\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 22 After saying this, he breathed on them, and said, \wj ‘\+w Receive\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Holy\+w* \+w Spirit\+w*;\wj* 
\v 23  \wj if \+w you\+w* remit \+w anyone\+w*’s sins, \+w they\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w been\+w* remitted; \+w and\+w*, if \+w you\+w* \+w retain\+w* \+w them\+w*, \+w they\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w been\+w* \+w retained\+w*.’\wj* 
\b
\p
\v 24 But Thomas, one of the Twelve, called “The Twin,” was not with them when Jesus came; 
\v 25 so the rest of the disciples said to him, ‘We have seen the Master!’ 
\p ‘Unless I see the marks of the nails in his hands,’ he exclaimed, ‘and put my finger into the marks, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe it.’ 
\v 26 A week later the disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them. After the doors had been shut, Jesus came and stood among them, and said, \wj ‘\+w Peace\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w you\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 27 Then he said to Thomas, \wj ‘\+w Place\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w finger\+w* \+w here\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w look\+w* \+w at\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w hands\+w*; \+w and\+w* \+w place\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w hand\+w* \+w here\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w put\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w into\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w side\+w*; \+w and\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w not\+w* refuse \+w to\+w* \+w believe\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w believe\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 28 And Thomas exclaimed, ‘My Master, and my God!’ 
\p
\v 29  \wj ‘\+w Is\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w because\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w seen\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w believed\+w*?’\wj* said Jesus. \wj ‘\+w Blessed\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w they\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w seen\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w yet\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w believed\+w*!’\wj* 
\b
\p
\v 30 There were many other signs of his mission that Jesus gave in presence of the disciples, which are not recorded in this book; 
\v 31 but these have been recorded so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God – and that, through your belief in his name, you may have life.

\p
\v 1 Later on, Jesus showed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias. 
\v 2 It was in this way, – Simon Peter, Thomas, who was called “The Twin,” Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, Zebedee’s sons, and two other disciples of Jesus, were together, when Simon Peter said, 
\v 3 ‘I am going fishing.’ 
\p ‘We will come with you,’ said the others. They went out and got into the boat, but caught nothing that night. 
\v 4 Just as day was breaking, Jesus came and stood on the beach; but the disciples did not know that it was he. 
\v 5  \wj ‘\+w My\+w* \+w children\+w*,’\wj* he said, \wj ‘\+w have\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w anything\+w* \+w to\+w* eat?’\wj* 
\p ‘No,’ they answered. 
\v 6  \wj ‘\+w Cast\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w net\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w right\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w boat\+w*,’\wj* he said, \wj ‘\+w and\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w find\+w* \+w fish\+w*.’\wj* So they cast the net, and now they could not haul it in because of the quantity of fish. 
\v 7 The disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, ‘It is the Master!’ When Simon Peter heard that it was the Master, he fastened his coat round him (for he had taken it off), and threw himself into the sea. 
\v 8 But the rest of the disciples came in the boat (for they were only about a hundred yards from shore), dragging the net full of fish. 
\v 9 When they had come ashore, they found a charcoal fire ready, with some fish already on it, and some bread as well. 
\v 10  \wj ‘\+w Bring\+w* \+w some\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w fish\+w* \+w which\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w just\+w* \+w caught\+w*,’\wj* said Jesus. 
\v 11 So Simon Peter got into the boat and hauled the net ashore full of large fish, a hundred and fifty-three of them; and yet, although there were so many, the net had not been torn. 
\v 12  \wj ‘\+w Come\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w have\+w* breakfast.’\wj*, Jesus said. None of the disciples dared ask him who he was, because they knew it was the Master. 
\v 13 Jesus went and took the bread and gave it to them, and the fish too. 
\v 14 This was the third time that Jesus showed himself to the disciples after he had risen from the dead. 
\b
\p
\v 15 When breakfast was over, Jesus said to Simon Peter, \wj ‘\+w Simon\+w*, son \+w of\+w* \+w John\+w*, \+w do\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w love\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w more\+w* \+w than\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w others\+w*?’\wj* 
\p ‘Yes, Master,’ he answered, ‘you know that I am your friend.’ 
\p \wj ‘\+w Feed\+w* \+w my\+w* lambs,’\wj* said Jesus. 
\v 16 Then, a second time, Jesus asked, \wj ‘\+w Simon\+w*, son \+w of\+w* \+w John\+w*, \+w do\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w love\+w* \+w me\+w*?’\wj* 
\p ‘Yes, Master,’ he answered, ‘you know that I am your friend.’ 
\p \wj ‘Tend \+w my\+w* \+w sheep\+w*,’\wj* said Jesus. 
\v 17 The third time, Jesus said to him, \wj ‘\+w Simon\+w*, son \+w of\+w* \+w John\+w*, \+w are\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w my\+w* friend?’\wj* Peter was hurt at his third question being “Are you my friend?”; and exclaimed, ‘Master, you know everything! You can tell that I am your friend.’ 
\p \wj ‘\+w Feed\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w sheep\+w*,’\wj* said Jesus. 
\v 18  \wj ‘\+w In\+w* truth \+w I\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w*,’ \+w he\+w* continued, ‘\+w when\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w were\+w* \+w young\+w*, \+w you\+w* used \+w to\+w* \+w put\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w own\+w* clothes, \+w and\+w* \+w walk\+w* \+w wherever\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w wished\+w*; \+w but\+w*, \+w when\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w have\+w* grown \+w old\+w*, \+w you\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w stretch\+w* \+w out\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w hands\+w*, \+w while\+w* someone \+w else\+w* puts \+w on\+w* \+w your\+w* clothes, \+w and\+w* takes \+w you\+w* \+w where\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w wish\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 19 Jesus said this to show the death by which Peter was to honour God, and then he added, \wj ‘\+w Follow\+w* \+w me\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 20 Peter turned round, and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following – the one who at the supper leant back on the Master’s shoulder, and asked him who it was who would betray him. 
\v 21 Seeing him, Peter said to Jesus, ‘Master, what about this man?’ 
\p
\v 22  \wj ‘\+w If\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w he\+w* \+w should\+w* wait \+w until\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w come\+w*,’\wj* answered Jesus, \wj ‘\+w what\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w you\+w*? \+w Follow\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w yourself\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 23 So the report spread among his followers that that disciple was not to die; yet Jesus did not say that he was not to die, but said \wj ‘\+w If\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w he\+w* \+w should\+w* wait \+w until\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w come\+w*, \+w what\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w you\+w*?’\wj* 
\b
\p
\v 24 It is this disciple who states these things, and who recorded them; and we know that his statement is true. 
\b
\p
\v 25 There are many other things which Jesus did; but, if every one of them were to be recorded in detail, I suppose that even the world itself would not hold the books that would be written.
