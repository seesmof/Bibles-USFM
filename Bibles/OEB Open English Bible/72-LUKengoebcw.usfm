\s1 Dedication 
\p
\v 1 To his Excellency, Theophilus. 
\p Many attempts have been already made to draw up an account of those events which have reached their conclusion among us, 
\v 2 just as they were reported to us by those who from the beginning were eye-witnesses, and afterwards became bearers of the message. 
\v 3 And, therefore, I also, since I have investigated all these events with great care from their very beginning, have resolved to write a connected history of them for you, 
\v 4 in order that you may be able to satisfy yourself of the accuracy of the story which you have heard from the lips of others. 
\s1 Birth, Parentage, Infancy and Boyhood 
\p
\v 5 In the reign of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the division called after Abijah. His wife, whose name was Elizabeth, was also a descendant of Aaron. 
\v 6 They were both righteous people, who lived blameless lives, guiding their steps by all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord. 
\v 7 But they had no child, Elizabeth being barren; and both of them were advanced in years. 
\p
\v 8 One day, when Zechariah was officiating as priest before God, during the turn of his division, 
\v 9 it fell to him by lot, in accordance with the practice among the priests, to go into the Temple of the Lord and burn incense; 
\v 10 and, as it was the Hour of Incense, the people were all praying outside. 
\v 11 And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right of the Altar of Incense. 
\v 12 Zechariah was startled at the sight and was awe-struck. 
\v 13 But the angel said to him, ‘Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, whom you will call by the name John. 
\v 14 He will be to you a joy and a delight; and many will rejoice over his birth. 
\v 15 For he will be great in the sight of the Lord; he will not drink any wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit from the very hour of his birth, 
\v 16 and will reconcile many of the Israelites to the Lord their God. 
\v 17 He will go before him in the spirit and with the power of Elijah, to reconcile fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, and so make ready for the Lord a people prepared for him.’ 
\p
\v 18 ‘How can I be sure of this?’ Zechariah asked the angel. ‘For I am an old man and my wife is advanced in years.’ 
\p
\v 19 ‘I am Gabriel,’ the angel answered, ‘who stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news. 
\v 20 And now you will be silent and unable to speak until the day when this takes place, because you did not believe what I said, though my words will be fulfilled in due course.’ 
\p
\v 21 Meanwhile the people were watching for Zechariah, wondering at his remaining so long in the Temple. 
\v 22 When he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision there. But Zechariah kept making signs to them, and remained dumb. 
\v 23 And, as soon as his term of service was finished, he returned home. 
\v 24 After this his wife, Elizabeth, became pregnant and lived in seclusion for five months. 
\v 25 ‘The Lord has done this for me,’ she said, ‘he has shown me kindness and taken away the public disgrace of childlessness under which I have been living.’ 
\b
\p
\v 26 Six months later the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth, 
\v 27 to a maiden there who was engaged to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. Her name was Mary. 
\v 28 Gabriel came into her presence and greeted her, saying, ‘You have been shown great favour – the Lord is with you.’ 
\p
\v 29 Mary was much disturbed at his words, and was wondering to herself what such a greeting could mean, 
\v 30 when the angel spoke again, ‘Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favour with God. 
\v 31 And now, you will conceive and give birth to a son, and you will give him the name Jesus. 
\v 32 The child will be great and will be called “Son of the Most High,” and the Lord God will give him the throne of his ancestor David, 
\v 33 and he will reign over the descendants of Jacob for ever; And to his kingdom there will be no end.’ 
\p
\v 34 ‘How can this be?’ Mary asked the angel. ‘For I have no husband.’ 
\p
\v 35 ‘The Holy Spirit will descend on you,’ answered the angel, ‘and the Power of the Most High will overshadow you; and therefore the child will be called “holy,” and “Son of God.” 
\v 36 And Elizabeth, your cousin, is herself also expecting a son in her old age; and it is now the sixth month with her, though she is called barren; 
\v 37 for no promise from God will fail to be fulfilled.’ 
\p
\v 38 ‘I am the servant of the Lord,’ exclaimed Mary. ‘Let it be with me as you have said.’ Then the angel left her. 
\p
\v 39 Soon after this Mary set out, and made her way quickly into the hill-country, to a town in Judah; 
\v 40 and there she went into Zechariah’s house and greeted Elizabeth. 
\v 41 When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the child moved within her, and Elizabeth herself was filled with the Holy Spirit, 
\v 42 and cried aloud, ‘Blessed are you among women, and blessed is your unborn child! 
\v 43 But how have I this honour, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? 
\v 44 For, as soon as your greeting reached my ears, the child moved within me with delight! 
\v 45 Happy indeed is she who believed that the promise which she received from the Lord would be fulfilled.’ 
\p
\v 46 And Mary said: 
\q1 ‘My soul exalts the Lord, 
\q2
\v 47 and my spirit delights in God my Saviour, 
\q1
\v 48 for he has looked with favour on his humble servant girl. 
\q2 From now on all generations will call me blessed! 
\b
\q1
\v 49 ‘For the Almighty has done great things for me, 
\q2 and holy is his name. 
\q1
\v 50 He has mercy on those who revere him 
\q2 in every generation. 
\b
\q1
\v 51 ‘Mighty are the deeds of his arm! 
\q2 He has scattered the self-satisfied proud, 
\q1
\v 52 he has cast down the mighty from their thrones, 
\q2 and he uplifts the humble, 
\q1
\v 53 he has filled the hungry with good things, 
\q2 and the rich he has sent away empty. 
\b
\q1
\v 54 ‘He has stretched out his hand to his servant Israel, 
\q2 ever mindful of his mercy, 
\q1
\v 55 as he promised to our ancestors, 
\q2 to Abraham and his descendants for ever.’ 
\m
\v 56 Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months, and then returned to her home. 
\v 57 When Elizabeth’s time came, she gave birth to a son; 
\v 58 and her neighbours and relatives, hearing of the great goodness of the Lord to her, came to share her joy. 
\v 59 A week later they met to circumcise the child, and were about to call him Zechariah after his father, 
\v 60 when his mother spoke up, ‘No, he is to be called John.’ 
\p
\v 61 ‘You have no relation of that name!’ they exclaimed; 
\v 62 and they made signs to the child’s father, to find out what he wished the child to be called. 
\v 63 Asking for a writing tablet, he wrote the words – “His name is John.” Everyone was surprised 
\v 64 and immediately Zechariah recovered his voice and the use of his tongue, and began to bless God. 
\v 65 All their neighbours were awe-struck at this, and throughout the hill-country of Judea the whole story was much talked about. 
\v 66 All who heard it kept it in mind, asking one another – ‘What can this child be destined to become?’ For the Power of the Lord was with him. 
\p
\v 67 Then his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit, and, speaking under inspiration, said: 
\q1
\v 68 ‘Blessed is the Lord, the God of Israel, 
\q2 who has visited his people and wrought their deliverance, 
\q1
\v 69 and has raised up for us the strength of our salvation 
\q2 in the house of his servant David – 
\q1
\v 70 as he promised by the lips of his holy prophets of old – 
\q2
\v 71 salvation from our enemies and from the hands of all who hate us, 
\q1
\v 72 showing mercy to our ancestors, 
\q2 and mindful of his sacred covenant. 
\m
\q1
\v 73 This was the oath which he swore to our ancestor Abraham – 
\q2
\v 74 that we should be rescued from the hands of our enemies, 
\q1
\v 75 and should serve him without fear in holiness and righteousness, 
\q2 in his presence all our days. 
\m
\q1
\v 76 And you, child, will be called prophet of the Most High, 
\q2 for you will go before the Lord to make ready his way, 
\q1
\v 77 to give his people the knowledge of salvation 
\q2 through the forgiveness of their sins, 
\q1
\v 78 through the tender mercy of our God, 
\q2 whereby the dawn will break on us from heaven, 
\q1
\v 79 to give light to those who live in darkness and the shadow of death, 
\q2 and guide our feet into the way of peace.’ 
\m
\v 80 The child grew and became strong in spirit, and he lived in the wilds until the time came for his appearance before Israel. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 About that time an edict was issued by the Emperor Augustus that a census should be taken of the whole Empire. 
\v 2 (This was the first census taken while Quirinius was Governor of Syria). 
\v 3 And everyone went to his own town to be registered. 
\v 4 Among others Joseph went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Bethlehem, the town of David, in Judea – because he belonged to the family and house of David – 
\v 5 to be registered with Mary, his engaged wife, who was about to become a mother. 
\v 6 While they were there her time came, 
\v 7 and she gave birth to her first child, a son. And because there was no room for them in the inn, she swathed him round and laid him in a manger. 
\v 8 In that same countryside were shepherds out in the open fields, watching their flocks that night, 
\v 9 when an angel of the Lord suddenly stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them; and they were seized with fear. 
\v 10 ‘Have no fear,’ the angel said. ‘For I bring you good news of a great joy in store for all the nation. 
\v 11 This day there has been born to you, in the town of David, a Saviour, who is Christ and Lord. 
\v 12 And this will be the sign for you. You will find the infant swathed, and lying in a manger.’ 
\p
\v 13 Then suddenly there appeared with the angel a multitude of the heavenly Host, praising God, and singing – 
\q1
\v 14 ‘glory to God on high, 
\q2 and on earth peace among those in whom he finds pleasure.’ 
\m
\v 15 Now, when the angels had left them and gone back to heaven, the shepherds said to one another, ‘Let us go at once to Bethlehem, and see this thing that has happened, of which the Lord has told us.’ 
\v 16 So they went quickly, and found Mary and Joseph, and the infant lying in a manger; 
\v 17 and, when they saw it, they told of all that had been said to them about this child. 
\v 18 All who heard the shepherds were astonished at their story, 
\v 19 while Mary treasured in her heart all that they said, and thought about it often. 
\v 20 And the shepherds went back, giving glory and praise to God for all that they had heard and seen. It had all happened as they had been told. 
\b
\p
\v 21 Eight days after the birth of the child, when it was time to circumcise him, he received the name Jesus – the name given him by the angel before his conception. 
\b
\p
\v 22 When the period of purification of mother and child, required by the Law of Moses, came to an end, his parents took the child up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord, 
\v 23 in compliance with the Law of the Lord that every firstborn male will be dedicated to the Lord, 
\v 24 and also to offer the sacrifice required by the Law of the Lord – a pair of turtle-doves or two young pigeons. 
\p
\v 25 There was at that time in Jerusalem a man named Simeon, a righteous and devout man, who lived in constant expectation of Israel’s consulation, and under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. 
\v 26 It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not die until he had seen the Lord’s Christ. 
\v 27 Moved by the Spirit, Simeon came into the Temple Courts, and, when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him what was customary under the Law, 
\v 28 Simeon himself took the child in his arms, and blessed God, and said: 
\q1
\v 29 ‘Now, Lord, you will let your servant go, 
\q2 according to your word, in peace, 
\q1
\v 30 for my eyes have seen the salvation 
\q2
\v 31 which you have prepared in the sight of all nations – 
\q1
\v 32 a light to bring light to the Gentiles, 
\q2 and to be the glory of your people Israel.’ 
\p
\v 33 While the child’s father and mother were wondering at what was said about him, 
\v 34 Simeon gave them his blessing, and said to Mary, the child’s mother, ‘This child is appointed to be the cause of the fall and rise of many in Israel, and to be a sign much spoken against – 
\v 35 Yes, the sword will pierce your own heart – and so the thoughts in many minds will be disclosed.’ 
\p
\v 36 There was also a prophet named Hannah, a daughter of Phanuel and of the tribe of Asher. She was far advanced in years, having lived with her husband for seven years after marriage, 
\v 37 and then a widow, until she had reached the age of eighty-four. She never left the Temple Courts, but, fasting and praying, worshiped God night and day. 
\v 38 At that moment she came up, and began publicly to thank God and to speak about the child to all who were looking for the deliverance of Jerusalem. 
\p
\v 39 When the child’s parents had done everything required by the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth. 
\v 40 The child grew and became strong and wise, and the blessing of God was on him. 
\b
\p
\v 41 Every year the child’s parents used to go to Jerusalem at the Passover Festival. 
\v 42 When Jesus was twelve years old, they went according to custom to Jerusalem, 
\v 43 and had finished their visit; but, when they started to return, the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem, without their knowing it. 
\v 44 Thinking that he was with their fellow travellers, they went one day’s journey before searching for him among their relatives and acquaintances; 
\v 45 and then, as they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem, searching everywhere for him. 
\v 46 It was not until the third day that they found him in the Temple Courts, sitting among the teachers, now listening to them, now asking them questions. 
\v 47 All who listened to him marvelled at his intelligence and his answers. 
\p
\v 48 His parents were amazed when they saw him, and his mother said to him, ‘My child, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been searching for you in great distress.’ 
\p
\v 49  \wj ‘\+w What\+w* \+w made\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w search\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w me\+w*?’\wj* he answered. \wj ‘Didn’\+w t\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w know\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w must\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w Father\+w*’s house?’\wj* 
\v 50 His parents did not understand what he meant. 
\v 51 However he went down with them to Nazareth, and submitted himself to their control; and his mother treasured all that was said in her heart. 
\v 52 And Jesus grew in wisdom as he grew in years, and gained the blessing of God and people. 
\c 3  
\s1 The Preparation 
\p
\v 1 In the fifteenth year of the reign of the Emperor Tiberius, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, Herod ruler of Galilee, his brother Philip ruler of the territory comprising Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias ruler of Abilene, 
\v 2 and when Annas and Caiaphas were high priests, a command from God came to John, the son of Zechariah, while he was in the wilderness. 
\v 3 And John went through the whole district of the Jordan, proclaiming a baptism of repentance, for the forgiveness of sins. 
\v 4 This was in fulfilment of what is said in the writings of the prophet Isaiah – 
\q1 “The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness: 
\q1 ‘Make ready the way of the Lord, 
\q2 make his paths straight. 
\q1
\v 5 Every chasm will be filled, 
\q2 every mountain and hill will be levelled. 
\q1 The winding ways will be straightened, 
\q2 the rough roads made smooth, 
\q3
\v 6 and everyone will see the salvation of God.’” 
\m
\v 7 And John said to the crowds that went to be baptized by him, ‘You children of snakes! Who has prompted you to seek refuge from the coming judgment? 
\v 8 Let your lives, then, prove your repentance; and do not begin to say among yourselves “Abraham is our ancestor,” for I tell you that out of these stones God is able to raise descendants for Abraham! 
\v 9 Already, indeed, the axe is lying at the root of the trees. Therefore every tree that fails to bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.’ 
\p
\v 10 ‘What are we to do then?’ the people asked. 
\v 11 ‘Let anyone who has two coats,’ answered John, ‘share with the person who has none; and anyone who has food do the same.’ 
\p
\v 12 Even tax collectors came to be baptized, and said to John, ‘Teacher, what are we to do?’ 
\p
\v 13 ‘Do not collect more than you have authority to demand,’ John answered. 
\v 14 And when some soldiers on active service asked ‘And we – what are we to do?’ he said, ‘Never use violence, or exact anything by false accusation; and be content with your pay.’ 
\p
\v 15 Then, while the people were in suspense, and were all debating with themselves whether John could be the Christ, 
\v 16 John, addressing them all, said, ‘I, indeed, baptize you with water; but there is coming one more powerful than I, and I am not fit even to unfasten his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. 
\v 17 His winnowing-fan is in his hand so that he may clear his threshing-floor, and store the grain in his barn, but the chaff he will burn with a fire that cannot be put out.’ 
\p
\v 18 And so with many different appeals John told his good news to the people. 
\v 19 But when John rebuked Herod the ruler, for Herodia his brother’s wife, and for all the evil things that he had done, 
\v 20 Herod crowned them all by shutting John up in prison. 
\b
\p
\v 21 Now after the baptism of all the people, and when Jesus had been baptized and was still praying, the heavens opened, 
\v 22 and the Holy Spirit came down on him in the form of a dove, and from the heavens came a voice – ‘You are my dearly loved son; you bring me great joy.’ 
\p
\v 23 When beginning his work, Jesus was about thirty years old. He was regarded as the son of Joseph, whose ancestors were – 
\q1 Eli, 
\v 24 Mattith, Levi, Melchiah, Janna, Joseph, 
\v 25 Mattithiah, Amos, Nahum, Azaliah, Nogah, 
\v 26 Mattith, Mattithiah, Shimei, Joseph, Josheh, 
\v 27 Johanan, Rhesa, Zerubbabel, Salathiel, Neriah, 
\v 28 Melchiah, Addi, Cosam, Elmodam, Er, 
\v 29 Joshua, Eliezer, Joram, Mattith, Levi, 
\v 30 Simeon, Judah, Joseph, Jonam, Eliakim, 
\v 31 Meleah, Menan, Mattithiah, Nathan, David, 
\v 32 Jesse, Obed, Boaz, Salah, Nahshon, 
\v 33 Aminadab, Arni, Hezron, Perez, Judah, 
\v 34 Jacob, Isaac, Abraham, Terah, Nahor, 
\v 35 Serug, Reu, Peleg, Eber, Shelah, 
\v 36 Kenan, Arpachshad, Shem, Noah, Lamech, 
\v 37 Methuselah, Enoch, Jared, Mahalalel, Kenan, 
\v 38 Enosh, Seth, son of Adam, and Adam, son of God. 
\m
\c  4  
\p
\v 1 On returning from the Jordan, full of the Holy Spirit, Jesus was led by the power of the Spirit through the wilderness for forty days, tempted by the devil. 
\p
\v 2 All that time he ate nothing; and, when it was over, he became hungry. 
\v 3 So the devil said to him, ‘If you are God’s Son, tell this stone to become a loaf of bread.’ 
\v 4 And Jesus answered him, \wj ‘\+w Scripture\+w* says – “\+w It\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w on\+w* bread \+w alone\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w a\+w* person \+w is\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w live\+w*.”’\wj* 
\p
\v 5 And the devil led Jesus up, and showing him in a single moment all the kingdoms of the earth, said to him, 
\v 6 ‘I will give you all this power, and the splendour of them; for it has been given into my hands and I give it to whom I wish. 
\v 7 If you worship me, it will all be yours.’ 
\v 8 And Jesus answered him, \wj ‘\+w Scripture\+w* \+w says\+w* – “\+w You\+w* \+w should\+w* \+w worship\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Lord\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w God\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w worship\+w* \+w him\+w* \+w only\+w*.”’\wj* 
\p
\v 9 The devil next led him into Jerusalem, and, placing him on the parapet of the Temple, said, ‘If you are God’s Son throw yourself down from here, 
\v 10 for scripture says – “He will give his angels commands about you, to guard you safely,” 
\v 11 And “On their hands they will lift you up, otherwise you might strike your foot against a stone.”’ 
\v 12 But Jesus answered him, \wj ‘\+w It\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w said\+w* – “\+w You\+w* \+w must\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w tempt\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Lord\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w God\+w*.”’\wj* 
\p
\v 13 When he had tried every kind of temptation, the devil left Jesus, until another opportunity. 
\s1 The Work in Galilee 
\p
\v 14 Moved by the power of the Spirit, Jesus returned to Galilee. Reports about him spread through all that region; 
\v 15 and he began to teach in their synagogues, and was honoured by everyone. 
\b
\p
\v 16 Coming to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, Jesus, as was his custom, went on the Sabbath into the synagogue, and stood up to read the scriptures. 
\v 17 He was given the book of the prophet Isaiah; and Jesus opened the book and found the place where it says – 
\q2
\v 18  \wj “\+w The\+w* \+w Spirit\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Lord\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w me\+w*, \wj*
\q1 \wj \+w for\+w* \+w he\+w* \+w has\+w* consecrated \+w me\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w bring\+w* \+w good\+w* \+w news\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w poor\+w*, \wj*
\q1 \wj \+w he\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w sent\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w proclaim\+w* release \+w to\+w* captives \+w and\+w* restoration \+w of\+w* sight \+w to\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w blind\+w*, \wj*
\q2 \wj \+w to\+w* \+w set\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w oppressed\+w* \+w at\+w* liberty,\wj* 
\q3
\v 19  \wj \+w to\+w* \+w proclaim\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w year\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Lord\+w*’\+w s\+w* favour.”\wj* 
\m
\v 20 Then, closing the book and returning it to the attendant, he sat down. The eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him, 
\v 21 and Jesus began, 
\p \wj ‘\+w This\+w* \+w very\+w* \+w day\+w* \+w this\+w* passage \+w has\+w* been \+w fulfilled\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w hearing\+w*.’\wj* 
\p
\v 22 All who were present spoke well of him, and were astonished at the beautiful words that fell from his lips. ‘Isn’t Joseph’s son?’ they asked. 
\v 23  \wj ‘Doubtless,’\wj* said Jesus, \wj ‘\+w you\+w* \+w will\+w* remind \+w me\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w saying\+w* – “Doctor, \+w cure\+w* \+w yourself\+w*;” \+w and\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w say\+w* “\+w Do\+w* \+w here\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w own\+w* \+w country\+w* \+w all\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w we\+w* \+w have\+w* heard \+w that\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w been\+w* \+w done\+w* \+w at\+w* \+w Capernaum\+w*.”\wj*

\v 28 All the people in the synagogue, as they listened to this, became enraged. 
\v 29 Starting up, they drove Jesus out of the town, and led him to the brow of the hill on which their town stood, intending to hurl him down. 
\v 30 But he passed through the middle of the crowd and went on his way. 
\b
\p
\v 31 Then Jesus went down to Capernaum, a city in Galilee. On the Sabbath he taught the people. 
\v 32 They were amazed at his teaching, because his words were spoken with authority. 
\v 33 In the synagogue there was a man with the spirit of a foul demon in him, who called out loudly, 
\v 34 ‘Stop! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are – the Holy One of God!’ 
\v 35 But Jesus rebuked the demon. \wj ‘\+w Be\+w* silent! \+w Come\+w* \+w out\+w* \+w from\+w* \+w him\+w*,’\wj* he said. The demon flung the man down in the middle of the people, and then came out from him, without causing him further harm. 
\v 36 And they were all lost in amazement, and kept saying to one another, ‘What words are these? For he gives his commands to the foul spirits with a marvellous authority, and they come out.’ 
\v 37 And rumours about Jesus traveled through every place in the region. 
\p
\v 38 On leaving the synagogue, Jesus went into Simon’s house. Now Simon’s mother-in-law was suffering from a severe attack of fever, and they asked Jesus to cure her. 
\v 39 Bending over her, he rebuked the fever; the fever left her, and she immediately got up and began to take care of them. 
\v 40 At sunset, all who had friends suffering from various diseases took them to Jesus; and he placed his hands on everyone of them and cured them. 
\v 41 And even demons came out from many people, screaming “You are the Son of God.” Jesus rebuked them, and would not allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ. 
\p
\v 42 At daybreak, Jesus went out and walked to a lonely spot. But crowds of people began to look for him; and they came to where he was and tried to detain him and prevent his leaving them. 
\v 43 Jesus, however, said to them, \wj ‘\+w I\+w* \+w must\+w* \+w take\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w good\+w* \+w news\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* kingdom \+w of\+w* \+w God\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w other\+w* \+w towns\+w* \+w too\+w*, \+w for\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w was\+w* \+w why\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w was\+w* \+w sent\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 44 And he continued to make his proclamation in the synagogues of Judea. 
\c 5  
\b
\p
\v 1 Once, when the people were pressing round Jesus as they listened to God’s message, he happened to be standing by the shore of the Lake of Gennesaret, and saw two boats close to the shore. 
\v 2 The fishermen had gone away from them and were washing the nets. 
\v 3 So, getting into one of the boats, which belonged to Simon, Jesus asked him to push off a little way from the shore, and then sat down and taught the people from the boat. 
\v 4 When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, \wj ‘Push off \+w into\+w* deep water, \+w and\+w* throw \+w out\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w nets\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w a\+w* haul.’\wj* 
\p
\v 5 ‘We have been hard at work all night, Sir,’ answered Simon, ‘and have not caught anything, but, at your bidding, I will throw out the nets.’ 
\v 6 They did so, and enclosed such a great shoal of fish that their nets began to break. 
\v 7 So they signalled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them; and they came and filled both the boats so full of fish that they were almost sinking. 
\v 8 When Simon Peter saw this, he threw himself down at Jesus’ knees, exclaiming, ‘Master, leave me, for I am a sinful man!’ 
\v 9 For he and all who were with him were lost in amazement at the haul of fish which they had made; 
\v 10 and so, too, were James and John, Zebedee’s sons, who were Simon’s partners. \wj ‘\+w Do\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w afraid\+w*,’\wj* Jesus said to Simon, \wj ‘\+w from\+w* today \+w you\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w catch\+w* \+w people\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 11 And, when they had brought their boats to shore, they left everything, and followed him. 
\b
\p
\v 12 On one occasion Jesus was staying in a town, when he saw a man who was covered with leprosy. When the leper saw Jesus, he threw himself on his face and implored his help, ‘Master, if only you are willing, you are able to make me clean.’ 
\v 13 Stretching out his hand, Jesus touched him, saying as he did so, \wj ‘\+w I\+w* \+w am\+w* \+w willing\+w*; become \+w clean\+w*.’\wj* 
\p Instantly the leprosy left the man; 
\v 14 and then Jesus impressed on him that he was not to say a word to anyone, \wj ‘\+w but\+w*,’\wj* he added, \wj ‘\+w set\+w* \+w out\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w show\+w* \+w yourself\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w priest\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w make\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w offerings\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w cleansing\+w*, \+w in\+w* \+w the\+w* manner \+w directed\+w* \+w by\+w* \+w Moses\+w*, \+w as\+w* evidence \+w of\+w* \+w your\+w* cure.’\wj* 
\v 15 However, the story about Jesus spread all the more, and great crowds came together to listen to him, and to be cured of their illnesses; 
\v 16 but Jesus used to withdraw to lonely places and pray. 
\p
\v 17 On one of those days, when Jesus was teaching, some Pharisees and Doctors of the Law were sitting near by. (They had come from all the villages in Galilee and Judea, and from Jerusalem; and the power of the Lord was on Jesus, so that he could work cures.) 
\v 18 And there some men brought on a bed a man who was paralysed. They tried to get him in and lay him before Jesus; 
\v 19 but, finding no way of getting him in owing to the crowd, they went up on the roof and lowered him through the tiles, with his pallet, into the middle of the people and in front of Jesus. 
\v 20 When he saw their faith, Jesus said, \wj ‘Friend, \+w your\+w* sins \+w have\+w* \+w been\+w* forgiven \+w you\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 21 The teachers of the Law and the Pharisees began debating about this. ‘Who is this man who speaks so blasphemously?’ they asked. ‘Who can forgive sins except God?’ 
\p
\v 22 When Jesus became aware of the way in which they were debating, he turned to them and exclaimed, \wj ‘\+w What\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w you\+w* debating \+w with\+w* \+w yourselves\+w*?\wj* 
\v 23  \wj \+w Which\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w easier\+w*? – \+w to\+w* \+w say\+w* “\+w Your\+w* sins \+w have\+w* \+w been\+w* forgiven \+w you\+w*”? \+w Or\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w say\+w* “\+w Get\+w* \+w up\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w walk\+w*”?\wj* 
\v 24  \wj \+w But\+w* \+w so\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w may\+w* \+w know\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Son\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Man\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w power\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w earth\+w* \+w to\+w* forgive sins’\wj* – he spoke to the paralysed man – \wj ‘\+w To\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w say\+w*, \+w Get\+w* \+w up\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w take\+w* \+w up\+w* \+w your\+w* pallet, \+w and\+w* \+w go\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w home\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 25 Instantly the man stood up before their eyes, took up what he had been lying on, and went to his home, praising God. 
\v 26 The people, one and all, were lost in amazement, and praised God; and in great awe they said, ‘We have seen marvellous things today!’ 
\b
\p
\v 27 After this, Jesus went out; and he noticed a tax-gatherer, named Levi, sitting in the tax office, and said to him, \wj ‘\+w Follow\+w* \+w me\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 28 Levi left everything and got up and followed him. 
\v 29 And Levi gave a great banquet at his house, in honour of Jesus; and a large number of tax collectors and others were having dinner with them. 
\p
\v 30 The Pharisees and the teachers of the Law belonging to their party complained of this to the disciples of Jesus. 
\v 31 In answer Jesus said, \wj ‘\+w It\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w those\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w well\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w need\+w* \+w a\+w* doctor, \+w but\+w* \+w those\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w ill\+w*.\wj* 
\v 32  \wj \+w I\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w come\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w call\+w* \+w the\+w* religious, \+w but\+w* \+w the\+w* outcast, \+w to\+w* repent.’\wj* 
\p
\v 33 ‘John’s disciples,’ they said to Jesus, ‘Often fast and say prayers, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, while yours are eating and drinking!’ 
\p
\v 34 But Jesus answered them, \wj ‘\+w Can\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w make\+w* \+w the\+w* groom’s friends \+w fast\+w* \+w while\+w* \+w the\+w* groom \+w is\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w them\+w*?\wj* 
\v 35  \wj \+w But\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w days\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w come\+w* – \+w a\+w* \+w time\+w* \+w when\+w* \+w the\+w* groom \+w will\+w* \+w be\+w* taken away \+w from\+w* \+w them\+w*; \+w and\+w* \+w they\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w fast\+w* \+w then\+w*, \+w when\+w* \+w those\+w* \+w days\+w* \+w come\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 36 Then, as an illustration, Jesus said to them, \wj ‘\+w No\+w* \+w one\+w* \+w ever\+w* \+w tears\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w piece\+w* \+w from\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w new\+w* \+w garment\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w puts\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w an\+w* \+w old\+w* \+w one\+w*; \+w for\+w*, \+w if\+w* \+w they\+w* \+w do\+w*, \+w they\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w only\+w* \+w tear\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w new\+w* \+w garment\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w piece\+w* \+w from\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w new\+w* \+w one\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w match\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w old\+w*.\wj*

\c 6  
\b
\p
\v 1 One Sabbath Jesus was walking through cornfields, and his disciples were picking the ears of wheat, and rubbing them in their hands, and eating them. 
\v 2 ‘Why are you doing what it is not allowable to do on the Sabbath?’ asked some of the Pharisees. 
\v 3 Jesus’ answer was, \wj ‘Haven’\+w t\+w* \+w you\+w* read \+w even\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w what\+w* \+w David\+w* \+w did\+w*, \+w when\+w* \+w he\+w* \+w was\+w* \+w hungry\+w*, \+w he\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w his\+w* \+w companions\+w* –\wj* 
\v 4  \wj \+w That\+w* \+w he\+w* \+w went\+w* \+w into\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w house\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w God\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w took\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w consecrated\+w* bread \+w and\+w* \+w ate\+w* \+w it\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w gave\+w* \+w some\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w his\+w* \+w companions\+w*, \+w though\+w* \+w only\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w priests\+w* \+w are\+w* allowed \+w to\+w* \+w eat\+w* \+w it\+w*?’\wj* 
\v 5 Then Jesus added, \wj ‘\+w The\+w* \+w Son\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Man\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w lord\+w* \+w even\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Sabbath\+w*.’\wj* 
\p
\v 6 On another Sabbath Jesus went into the synagogue and taught; and there was a man there whose right hand was withered. 
\v 7 The teachers of the Law and the Pharisees watched Jesus closely, to see if he would work cures on the Sabbath, so that they might find a charge to bring against him. 
\v 8 Jesus, however, knew what was in the their minds, and said to the man whose hand was withered, \wj ‘\+w Stand\+w* \+w up\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w come\+w* \+w out\+w* \+w into\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w middle\+w*.’\wj* The man stood up; 
\v 9 and Jesus said to them, \wj ‘\+w I\+w* \+w ask\+w* \+w you\+w*, \+w is\+w* \+w it\+w* allowable \+w to\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w good\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Sabbath\+w* – \+w or\+w* \+w harm\+w*? \+w To\+w* \+w save\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w life\+w*, \+w or\+w* \+w let\+w* \+w it\+w* perish?’\wj* 
\v 10 Then, looking round at them all, he said to the man, \wj ‘\+w Stretch\+w* \+w out\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w hand\+w*.’\wj* The man did so; and his hand had become sound. 
\v 11 But the teachers of the Law and the Pharisees were mad with rage, and consulted together what they could do to Jesus. 
\p
\v 12 Now about that time, Jesus went out, up the hill, to pray, and spent the whole night in prayer to God. 
\v 13 When day came, he summoned his disciples, and chose twelve of them, whom he also named “apostles.” 
\v 14 They were Simon (whom Jesus also named Peter), and his brother Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, 
\v 15 Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon known as the Zealot, 
\v 16 Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who proved a traitor. 
\v 17 Afterwards Jesus came down the hill with them and took his stand on a level place. With him were a large crowd of his disciples, and great numbers of people from the whole of Judea, Jerusalem, and the coast district of Tyre and Sidon, 
\v 18 who had come to hear him and to be restored to health. Those, too, who were troubled with foul spirits were cured; 
\v 19 and everyone in the crowd was trying to touch him, because a power went out from him which restored them all. 
\p
\v 20 Then, raising his eyes and looking at his disciples, Jesus said: 
\q1 \wj ‘\+w Blessed\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w poor\+w*, \+w for\+w* \+w yours\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w the\+w* kingdom \+w of\+w* \+w God\+w*.\wj*

\p
\v 1 When Jesus had brought to a conclusion all that he had then had to say to the people, he entered Capernaum. 
\p
\v 2 A centurion in the Roman army had a slave whom he valued, and who was seriously ill – almost at the point of death. 
\v 3 And, hearing about Jesus, he sent some Jewish elders to him, with the request that he would come and save his slave’s life. 
\v 4 When they found Jesus, they earnestly implored him to do so. ‘He deserves the favour from you,’ they said, 
\v 5 ‘For he is devoted to our nation, and himself built our synagogue for us.’ 
\v 6 So Jesus went with them. But, when he was no great distance from the house, the centurion sent some friends with the message – ‘Do not trouble yourself, Sir; for I am unworthy to receive you under my roof. 
\v 7 That was why I did not even venture to come to you myself; but speak, and let my manservant be cured. 
\v 8 For I myself am a man under the orders of others, with soldiers under me; and if I say to one of them “Go,” he goes, and to another “Come,” he comes, and to my slave “Do this,” he does it.’ 
\v 9 Jesus was surprised to hear these words from him; and, turning to the crowd which was following him, he said, \wj ‘\+w I\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w*, nowhere \+w in\+w* \+w Israel\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w I\+w* met \+w with\+w* \+w such\+w* \+w faith\+w* \+w as\+w* \+w this\+w*!’\wj* 
\v 10 And, when the messengers returned to the house, they found the slave recovered. 
\p
\v 11 Shortly after, Jesus went to a town called Nain, his disciples and a great crowd going with him. 
\v 12 Just as he approached the gate of the town, there was a dead man being carried out for burial – an only son, and his mother was a widow. A large number of the people of the town were with her. 
\v 13 When he saw her, the Master was moved with compassion for her, and he said to her, \wj ‘\+w Do\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w weep\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 14 Then he went up and touched the bier, and the bearers stopped; and Jesus said, \wj ‘\+w Young\+w* \+w man\+w*, \+w I\+w* \+w am\+w* \+w speaking\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w you\+w* – \+w Rise\+w*!’\wj* 
\v 15 The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus restored him to his mother. 
\v 16 Everyone was awe-struck and began praising God. ‘A great prophet has arisen among us,’ they said. ‘God has visited his people.’ 
\p
\v 17 And this story about Jesus spread all through Judea, and in the neighbouring countries as well. 
\b
\p
\v 18 All these events were reported to John by his disciples. 
\v 19 So he summoned two of them, and sent them to the Master to ask – ‘Are you “the coming one,” or are we to look for someone else?’ 
\p
\v 20 When these men found Jesus, they said, ‘John the Baptist has sent us to you to ask – Are you “the coming one,” or are we to look for somebody else?’ 
\v 21 At that very time Jesus had cured many people of diseases, afflictions, and wicked spirits, and had given many blind people their sight. 
\v 22 So his answer to the question was, \wj ‘\+w Go\+w* \+w and\+w* report \+w to\+w* \+w John\+w* \+w what\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w witnessed\+w* \+w and\+w* heard – \+w the\+w* \+w blind\+w* recover \+w their\+w* sight, \+w the\+w* \+w lame\+w* \+w walk\+w*, \+w the\+w* \+w lepers\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w made\+w* \+w clean\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w deaf\+w* hear, \+w the\+w* \+w dead\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w raised\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w life\+w*, \+w the\+w* \+w good\+w* \+w news\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w told\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w poor\+w*.\wj*

\p
\v 24 When John’s messengers had left, Jesus, speaking to the crowds, began to say with reference to John, 
\v 25  \wj ‘\+w What\+w* \+w did\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w go\+w* \+w out\+w* \+w into\+w* \+w the\+w* wilderness \+w to\+w* \+w look\+w* \+w at\+w*? \+w A\+w* reed waving \+w in\+w* \+w the\+w* wind? \+w If\+w* \+w not\+w*, \+w what\+w* \+w did\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w go\+w* \+w out\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w see\+w*? \+w A\+w* \+w man\+w* \+w dressed\+w* \+w in\+w* rich \+w clothing\+w*? \+w Why\+w*, \+w those\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w are\+w* accustomed \+w to\+w* \+w fine\+w* \+w clothes\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w luxury\+w* \+w live\+w* \+w in\+w* royal palaces.\wj*

\v 29 (All the people, when they heard this, and even the tax collectors, having accepted John’s baptism, acknowledged the justice of God.

\v 36 One of the Pharisees asked Jesus to dine with him, so Jesus went to his house and took his place at the table. 
\v 37 Just then a woman, who was an outcast in the town, having heard that Jesus was eating in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster jar of perfume, 
\v 38 and placed herself behind Jesus, near his feet, weeping. Then she began to make his feet wet with her tears, and she dried them with the hair of her head, repeatedly kissing his feet and anointing them with the perfume. 
\p
\v 39 When the Pharisee who had invited Jesus saw this, he said to himself, ‘Had this man been “the prophet,” he would have known who, and what sort of woman, this is who is touching him, and that she is an outcast.’ 
\v 40 But, addressing him, Jesus said, \wj ‘\+w Simon\+w*, \+w I\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w something\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w say\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w you\+w*.’\wj* 
\p ‘Pray do so, teacher,’ Simon answered; and Jesus began, 
\v 41  \wj ‘\+w There\+w* \+w were\+w* \+w two\+w* \+w people\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w were\+w* \+w in\+w* debt \+w to\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w moneylender\+w*; \+w one\+w* \+w owed\+w* \+w five\+w* \+w hundred\+w* silver coins, \+w and\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w other\+w* \+w fifty\+w*.\wj* 
\v 42  \wj \+w As\+w* \+w they\+w* \+w were\+w* \+w unable\+w* \+w to\+w* pay, \+w he\+w* \+w forgave\+w* \+w them\+w* both. \+w Which\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w them\+w*, \+w do\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w think\+w*, \+w will\+w* love him \+w the\+w* \+w more\+w*?’\wj* 
\p
\v 43 ‘I suppose,’ answered Simon, ‘it will be the man to whom he forgave the greater debt.’ 
\p \wj ‘\+w You\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w right\+w*,’\wj* said Jesus, 
\v 44 and then, turning to the woman, he said to Simon, \wj ‘\+w Do\+w* \+w you\+w* see \+w this\+w* \+w woman\+w*? \+w I\+w* \+w came\+w* \+w into\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w house\+w* – \+w you\+w* \+w gave\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w no\+w* \+w water\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w feet\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w she\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w made\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w feet\+w* \+w wet\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w her\+w* \+w tears\+w* \+w and\+w* dried \+w them\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w her\+w* \+w hair\+w*.\wj* 
\v 45  \wj \+w You\+w* \+w did\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w give\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w one\+w* \+w kiss\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w she\+w*, \+w from\+w* \+w the\+w* moment \+w I\+w* \+w came\+w* \+w in\+w*, \+w has\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w ceased\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w kiss\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w feet\+w*.\wj* 
\v 46  \wj \+w You\+w* \+w did\+w* \+w not\+w* anoint \+w even\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w head\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w oil\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w she\+w* \+w has\+w* anointed \+w my\+w* \+w feet\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w perfume\+w*.\wj*

\v 48 Then he said to the woman, \wj ‘\+w Your\+w* sins \+w have\+w* been pardoned.’\wj* 
\v 49 The other guests began to say to one another, ‘Who is this man who even pardons sins?’ 
\v 50 But Jesus said to the woman, \wj ‘\+w Your\+w* \+w faith\+w* \+w has\+w* delivered \+w you\+w*; \+w go\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w peace\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w you\+w*.’\wj*

\v 1 Shortly afterwards, Jesus went on a journey through the towns and villages, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. With him went the Twelve, 
\v 2 as well as some women who had been cured of wicked spirits and of infirmities. They were Mary, known as Mary of Magdala (from whom seven demons had been expelled), 
\v 3 and Joanna (the wife of Herod’s steward, Chuza), and Susannah, and many others – all of whom provided for Jesus and his apostles out of their own resources. 
\p
\v 4 Once, when a great crowd was collecting, and, when the people of town after town were flocking to Jesus, he spoke to them in the form of a parable, 
\v 5  \wj ‘\+w The\+w* \+w sower\+w* \+w went\+w* \+w out\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w sow\+w* \+w his\+w* \+w seed\+w*; \+w and\+w*, \+w as\+w* \+w he\+w* \+w was\+w* \+w sowing\+w*, \+w some\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w seed\+w* \+w fell\+w* \+w along\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w path\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w was\+w* trodden \+w on\+w*; \+w and\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w wild\+w* \+w birds\+w* \+w ate\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w up\+w*.\wj*

\p
\v 9 His disciples asked Jesus the meaning of this parable. 
\v 10  \wj ‘\+w To\+w* \+w you\+w*,’\wj* he said, \wj ‘\+w the\+w* \+w knowledge\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* hidden truths \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* kingdom \+w of\+w* \+w God\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w been\+w* imparted, \+w but\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w others\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w parables\+w* \+w only\+w*, \+w so\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w though\+w* \+w they\+w* \+w have\+w* eyes \+w they\+w* \+w may\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w see\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w though\+w* \+w they\+w* \+w have\+w* ears, \+w they\+w* \+w may\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w understand\+w*.\wj*

\v 19 Presently Jesus’ mother and brothers came where he was, but they were not able to join him because of the crowd. 
\v 20 So word was brought to him – “Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you.” 
\v 21 His reply, spoken to them all, was, \wj ‘\+w My\+w* \+w mother\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w my\+w* brothers \+w are\+w* \+w those\+w* \+w who\+w* listen \+w to\+w* \+w God\+w*’s \+w teaching\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w what\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w says\+w*.’\wj* 
\p
\v 22 One day about that time, Jesus got into a boat with his disciples and said to them, \wj ‘\+w Let\+w* \+w us\+w* \+w go\+w* \+w across\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w lake\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 23 So they put off. While they were sailing, Jesus fell asleep. A squall swept down on the lake, and their boat was filling and they were in danger. 
\v 24 So the disciples came and roused him. ‘Sir, Sir,’ they cried, ‘we are lost!’ Jesus rose and rebuked the wind and the rushing waves, and they fell, and a calm followed. 
\v 25  \wj ‘\+w Where\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w faith\+w*?’\wj* he exclaimed. But in great awe and amazement they said to one another, ‘Who can this be, who commands even the winds and the waves, and they obey him?’ 
\p
\v 26 They reached the region of the Gerasenes, which is on the opposite side to Galilee, 
\v 27 and, on getting ashore, Jesus met a man, who had demons in him, coming out of the town. For a long time this man had worn no clothing, and he had not lived in a house, but in the tombs. 
\v 28 Catching sight of Jesus, he shrieked out and threw himself down before him, and in a loud voice exclaimed, ‘What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you not to torment me.’ 
\v 29 For Jesus was commanding the foul spirit to come out of the man. On many occasions it had seized him, and, even when secured with chains and fetters, and watched, he would break through anything that bound him, and be driven by the demon into the wilds. 
\p
\v 30  \wj ‘\+w What\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w name\+w*?’\wj* Jesus asked. 
\p ‘Legion,’ he answered (for many demons had taken possession of him); 
\v 31 and the demons begged Jesus not to order them away into the bottomless pit. 
\v 32 There was a herd of many pigs close by feeding on the hill-side; and the demons begged Jesus to give them leave to enter into them. Jesus gave them leave. 
\v 33 They came out from the man and took possession of the pigs; and the herd rushed down the steep slope into the lake and were drowned. 
\v 34 When the men who tended them saw what had happened, they ran away, and carried the news to the town, and to the country round. 
\v 35 The people went out to see what had happened, and, when they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting, clothed and in his right mind, at Jesus’ feet; and they were awe-struck. 
\v 36 Those who had seen it told them how the possessed man had been delivered. 
\v 37 Then all the people in the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them, for they were terrified. Jesus got into a boat and returned. 
\v 38 The man from whom the demons had gone out begged Jesus to let him be with him; but Jesus sent him away. 
\v 39  \wj ‘\+w Go\+w* \+w back\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w home\+w*,’\wj* he said, \wj ‘\+w and\+w* \+w relate\+w* \+w the\+w* story \+w of\+w* \+w all\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w God\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w done\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w you\+w*.’ \+w So\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w man\+w* \+w went\+w* \+w through\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w whole\+w* \+w town\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w proclaimed\+w*, \+w as\+w* \+w he\+w* \+w went\+w*, \+w all\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w Jesus\+w* \+w had\+w* \+w done\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w him\+w*.\wj*

\p
\v 40 On his return, Jesus was welcomed by the people; for everyone was looking out for him. 
\v 41 And a man named Jairus, who was a synagogue leader, came to Jesus, and threw himself at Jesus’ feet, with entreaties that he would come to his house, 
\v 42 because his only daughter, who was about twelve years old, was dying. As Jesus was going, the people were pressing closely round him. 
\v 43 And a woman, who had suffered from haemorrhage for twelve years, and whom no one could cure, 
\v 44 came up behind and touched the tassel of his cloak. Instantly the haemorrhage ceased. 
\p
\v 45  \wj ‘\+w Who\+w* touched \+w me\+w*?’\wj* Jesus asked; and, while everyone was denying having done so, Peter exclaimed, ‘Why, Sir, the people are crowding round you and pressing against you!’ 
\p
\v 46  \wj ‘\+w Somebody\+w* touched \+w me\+w*,’\wj* said Jesus, \wj ‘\+w for\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w felt\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w power\+w* \+w had\+w* \+w gone\+w* \+w out\+w* \+w from\+w* \+w me\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 47 Then the woman, when she saw that she was discovered, came forward trembling, and threw herself down before him; and, in the presence of all the people, she told him her reason for touching him, and that she had been cured instantly. 
\p
\v 48  \wj ‘\+w Daughter\+w*,’\wj* he said, \wj ‘\+w your\+w* \+w faith\+w* \+w has\+w* delivered \+w you\+w*. \+w Go\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w peace\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w you\+w*.’\wj* 
\p
\v 49 Before he had finished speaking, someone came from the house of the synagogue leader and said, ‘Your daughter is dead! Do not trouble the teacher further.’ 
\v 50 But Jesus, hearing this, spoke to the leader, \wj ‘\+w Do\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w afraid\+w*; \+w only\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w faith\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w she\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w yet\+w* \+w be\+w* delivered.’\wj* 
\v 51 When he reached the house, he did not allow anyone to go in with him, except Peter, John, and James, and the child’s father and mother. 
\v 52 And everyone was weeping and mourning for her. 
\p \wj ‘\+w Do\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w weep\+w*,’\wj* Jesus said, \wj ‘\+w she\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w not\+w* dead; \+w she\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w asleep\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 53 They began to laugh at him, for they knew that she was dead. 
\v 54 But, taking her by the hand, Jesus said in a loud voice, \wj ‘\+w Child\+w*, \+w rise\+w*!’\wj* 
\v 55 The child’s spirit returned to her, and she instantly stood up; and Jesus ordered them to give her something to eat. 
\v 56 Her parents were amazed, but Jesus impressed on them that they were not to tell anyone what had happened. 
\c 9

\p
\v 1 Jesus called the Twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, as well as to cure diseases. 
\v 2 He sent them out as his messengers, to proclaim the kingdom of God, and to work cures. 
\v 3  \wj ‘\+w Do\+w* \+w not\+w*,’\wj* he said to them, \wj ‘\+w take\+w* \+w anything\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w journey\+w*; \+w not\+w* \+w even\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w staff\+w*, \+w or\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w bag\+w*, \+w or\+w* bread, \+w or\+w* \+w any\+w* silver, \+w or\+w* \+w a\+w* change \+w of\+w* \+w clothes\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w you\+w*.\wj*

\v 6 Then they set out and went from village to village, telling the good news and curing people everywhere. 
\p
\v 7 Herod the ruler heard of all that was happening, and was perplexed, because it was said by some that John must be risen from the dead. 
\v 8 Some again said that Elijah had appeared, and others that one of the old prophets had risen again. 
\v 9 But Herod himself said, ‘John I beheaded; but who is this of whom I hear such things?’ And he endeavoured to see him. 
\p
\v 10 When the apostles returned, they related to Jesus all that they had done. Then Jesus went privately to a town called Bethsaida, taking the apostles with him. 
\v 11 But the people recognised him and followed him in crowds; and Jesus welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, while he cured those who were in need of help. 
\v 12 The day was drawing to a close, when the twelve came up to him, and said, ‘Send the crowd away, so that they may make their way to the villages and farms round about, and find themselves lodgings and provisions, for we are in a lonely spot here.’ 
\v 13 But Jesus said, \wj ‘\+w It\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w give\+w* \+w them\+w* \+w something\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w eat\+w*.’\wj* 
\p ‘We have not more than five loaves and two fish,’ they answered. ‘Unless indeed we are to go and buy food for all these people.’ 
\v 14 (For the men among them were about five thousand.) \wj ‘Get \+w them\+w* seated \+w in\+w* companies,’\wj* was his reply, \wj ‘\+w about\+w* \+w fifty\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w each\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 15 This they did, and got all the people seated. 
\v 16 Taking the five loaves and the two fish, Jesus looked up to heaven and said the blessing over them. Then he broke them in pieces, and gave them to his disciples to set before the people. 
\v 17 Everyone had sufficient to eat, and what was left of the broken pieces was picked up – twelve baskets. 
\p
\v 18 Afterwards, when Jesus was alone, praying, his disciples joined him, and he asked them this question – \wj ‘\+w Who\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w people\+w* \+w say\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w am\+w*?’\wj* 
\p
\v 19 ‘John the Baptist,’ was their answer. ‘Others, however, say that you are Elijah, while others say that one of the old prophets has risen again.’ 
\p
\v 20  \wj ‘\+w But\+w* \+w you\+w*,’\wj* he went on, \wj ‘\+w who\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w say\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w am\+w*?’\wj* And to this Peter answered, ‘The Christ of God.’ 
\p
\v 21 Jesus, however, strictly charged them not to say this to anyone; 
\v 22 he told them that the Son of Man must undergo much suffering, and be rejected by the elders, and chief priests, and teachers of the Law, and be put to death, and rise on the third day. 
\v 23 And to all present he said, \wj ‘\+w If\+w* \+w any\+w* \+w one\+w* \+w wishes\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w walk\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w my\+w* steps, \+w they\+w* \+w must\+w* renounce self, \+w and\+w* \+w take\+w* \+w up\+w* \+w their\+w* \+w cross\+w* \+w daily\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w follow\+w* \+w me\+w*.\wj* 
\v 24  \wj \+w For\+w* \+w whoever\+w* \+w wishes\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w save\+w* \+w their\+w* \+w life\+w* \+w will\+w* lose \+w it\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w whoever\+w*, \+w for\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w sake\+w*, loses \+w his\+w* \+w life\+w* – \+w that\+w* \+w person\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w save\+w* \+w it\+w*.\wj* 
\v 25  \wj \+w What\+w* \+w good\+w* \+w does\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w do\+w* someone \+w if\+w*, \+w when\+w* \+w they\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w gained\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w whole\+w* \+w world\+w*, \+w they\+w* \+w has\+w* lost \+w or\+w* forfeited \+w themselves\+w*?\wj* 
\v 26  \wj \+w Whoever\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w ashamed\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w teaching\+w*, \+w the\+w* \+w Son\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Man\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w ashamed\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w them\+w*, \+w when\+w* \+w he\+w* \+w comes\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w his\+w* \+w glory\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w glory\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w father\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* holy angels.\wj*

\b
\p
\v 28 About eight days after speaking these words, Jesus went up the mountain to pray, taking with him Peter, John, and James. 
\v 29 As he was praying, the aspect of his face was changed, and his clothing became a dazzling white. 
\v 30 And all at once two men were talking with Jesus; they were Moses and Elijah, 
\v 31 who appeared in a glorified state, and spoke of his departure, which was destined to take place at Jerusalem. 
\v 32 Peter and his companions had been overpowered by sleep but, suddenly becoming wide awake, they saw Jesus glorified and the two men who were standing beside him. 
\p
\v 33 And, as Moses and Elijah were passing away from Jesus, Peter exclaimed, ‘Sir, it is good to be here; let us make three tents, one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.’ He did not know what he was saying; 
\v 34 and, while he was speaking, a cloud came down and enveloped them; and they were afraid, as they passed into the cloud; 
\v 35 and from the cloud came a voice which said – ‘This is my Son, the Chosen One; him you must hear.’ 
\v 36 And, as the voice ceased, Jesus was found alone. The apostles kept silence, and told no one about any of the things that they had seen. 
\b
\p
\v 37 The next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great crowd met Jesus. 
\v 38 And just then a man in the crowd shouted out, ‘Teacher, I entreat you to look at my son, for he is my only child; 
\v 39 all at once a spirit will seize him, suddenly shriek out, and throw him into convulsions until he foams, and will leave him only when he is utterly exhausted. 
\v 40 I entreated your disciples to drive the spirit out, but they could not.’ 
\p
\v 41  \wj ‘Faithless \+w and\+w* \+w perverse\+w* \+w generation\+w*!’\wj* Jesus exclaimed, \wj ‘\+w How\+w* \+w long\+w* \+w must\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w have\+w* patience \+w with\+w* \+w you\+w*? \+w Lead\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w son\+w* \+w here\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 42 While the boy was coming up to Jesus, the demon dashed him down and threw him into convulsions. But Jesus rebuked the foul spirit, and cured the boy, and gave him back to his father. 
\v 43 And all present were struck with awe at the majesty of God. 
\p In the midst of the general astonishment at all that Jesus was doing, he said to his disciples, 
\v 44  \wj ‘Listen carefully \+w to\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w words\+w*. \+w For\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Son\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Man\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w destined\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w betrayed\+w* \+w into\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w hands\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w his\+w* fellow \+w men\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 45 But the disciples did not understand the meaning of this; it had been concealed from them so that they did not see it, and they were afraid to question him as to what he meant. 
\p
\v 46 A discussion arose among the disciples as to which of them was the greatest; 
\v 47 and Jesus, knowing of the discussion that was occupying their thoughts, took hold of a little child, and placed it beside him, 
\v 48 and then said to them, \wj ‘\+w Anyone\+w* \+w who\+w*, \+w for\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w sake\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w name\+w*, \+w welcomes\+w* \+w even\+w* \+w this\+w* \+w little\+w* \+w child\+w* \+w is\+w* welcoming \+w me\+w*; \+w and\+w* \+w anyone\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w welcomes\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w is\+w* welcoming \+w him\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w sent\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w as\+w* \+w his\+w* messenger. \+w For\+w* \+w whoever\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w least\+w* \+w among\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w all\+w* – \+w that\+w* \+w person\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w great\+w*.’\wj* 
\p
\v 49 John said, ‘Sir, we saw a man driving out demons by using your name, and we tried to prevent him, because he does not follow you with us.’ 
\p
\v 50  \wj ‘\+w None\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w must\+w* \+w prevent\+w* \+w him\+w*,’\wj* Jesus said to John, \wj ‘\+w whoever\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w against\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w you\+w*.’\wj* 
\s1 The Journey to Jerusalem 
\p
\v 51 As the days before his being taken up to heaven were growing few, Jesus set his face resolutely in the direction of Jerusalem; and he sent on messengers in advance. 
\v 52 On their way, they went into a Samaritan village to make preparations for him, 
\v 53 but the people there did not welcome him, because his face was set in the direction of Jerusalem. 
\v 54 When James and John saw this, they said, ‘Master, do you wish us to call for fire to come down from the heavens and consume them?’ 
\v 55 But Jesus turned and rebuked them. 
\v 56  \wj \+w And\+w* \+w they\+w* \+w made\+w* \+w their\+w* \+w way\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w another\+w* \+w village\+w*.\wj* 
\b
\p
\v 57 And, while they were on their way, a man said to Jesus, ‘I will follow you wherever you go.’ 
\p
\v 58  \wj ‘Foxes \+w have\+w* \+w holes\+w*,’\wj* he replied, \wj ‘\+w and\+w* \+w wild\+w* \+w birds\+w* \+w their\+w* \+w nests\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Son\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Man\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w nowhere\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w lay\+w* \+w his\+w* \+w head\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 59 To another man Jesus said, \wj ‘\+w Follow\+w* \+w me\+w*.’\wj* 
\p ‘Let me first go and bury my father,’ said the man. 
\v 60 But Jesus said, \wj ‘Leave \+w the\+w* \+w dead\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w bury\+w* \+w their\+w* \+w dead\+w*; \+w but\+w* go \+w yourself\+w* \+w and\+w* carry \+w far\+w* \+w and\+w* wide \+w the\+w* news \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* kingdom \+w of\+w* \+w God\+w*.’\wj* 
\p
\v 61 ‘Master,’ said another, ‘I will follow you; but first let me say goodbye to my family.’ 
\v 62 But Jesus answered, \wj ‘\+w No\+w* \+w one\+w* \+w who\+w* looks \+w back\+w*, \+w after\+w* \+w putting\+w* \+w their\+w* \+w hand\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w the\+w* plough, \+w is\+w* fitted \+w for\+w* \+w the\+w* kingdom \+w of\+w* \+w God\+w*.’\wj* 
\c 10  
\b
\p
\v 1 After this, the Master appointed seventy-two other disciples, and sent them on as his messengers, two and two, in advance, to every town and place that he was himself intending to visit. 
\p
\v 2  \wj ‘\+w The\+w* \+w harvest\+w*,’\wj* he said, \wj ‘\+w is\+w* \+w abundant\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w labourers\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w few\+w*. \+w Therefore\+w* \+w pray\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w owner\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w harvest\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w send\+w* \+w labourers\+w* \+w to\+w* gather \+w in\+w* \+w his\+w* \+w harvest\+w*.\wj*

\v 25 Just then a student of the Law came forward to test Jesus further. ‘Teacher,’ he said, ‘what must I do if I am to gain eternal life?’

\v 26  \wj ‘\+w What\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w said\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Law\+w*?’\wj* answered Jesus. \wj ‘\+w What\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w read\+w* \+w there\+w*?’\wj* 
\v 27 His reply was – 
\q1 ‘You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbour as you love yourself.’

\v 28  \wj ‘\+w You\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w answered\+w* \+w right\+w*,’\wj* said Jesus, \wj ‘\+w Do\+w* \+w that\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w live\+w*.’\wj*

\v 38 As they continued their journey, Jesus came to a village, where a woman named Martha welcomed him to her house. 
\v 39 She had a sister called Mary, who seated herself at the Master’s feet, and listened to his teaching; 
\v 40 but Martha was distracted by the many preparations that she was making. So she went up to Jesus and said, ‘Master, do you approve of my sister’s leaving me to make preparations alone? Tell her to help me.’

\v 1 One day Jesus was at a certain place praying, and, when he had finished, one of his disciples said to him, ‘Master, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples.’

\v 14 Once Jesus was driving out a mute demon, and, when the demon had gone out, the mute man spoke. The people were amazed at this;

\v 10 Jesus was teaching on a Sabbath in one of the synagogues, 
\v 11 and he saw before him a woman who for eighteen years had suffered from weakness owing to her having an evil spirit in her. She was bent double, and was wholly unable to raise herself. 
\v 12 When Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said, \wj ‘\+w Woman\+w*, \+w you\+w* \+w are\+w* released \+w from\+w* \+w your\+w* weakness.’\wj* 
\v 13 He placed his hands on her, and she was instantly made straight, and began to praise God. 
\v 14 But the synagogue leader, indignant that Jesus had worked the cure on the Sabbath, intervened and said to the people, ‘There are six days on which work ought to be done; come to be cured on one of those, and not on the Sabbath.’ 
\p
\v 15  \wj ‘\+w You\+w* \+w hypocrites\+w*!’\wj* the Master answered him. \wj ‘\+w Does\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w everyone\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w let\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w ox\+w* \+w or\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w donkey\+w* \+w loose\+w* \+w from\+w* \+w its\+w* \+w manger\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w take\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w out\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w drink\+w*, \+w on\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Sabbath\+w*?\wj*

\v 17 As he said this, his opponents all felt ashamed; but all the people rejoiced to see all the wonderful things that he was doing. 
\p
\v 18 So Jesus said, \wj ‘\+w What\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w the\+w* kingdom \+w of\+w* \+w God\+w* \+w like\+w*? \+w And\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w what\+w* \+w can\+w* \+w I\+w* liken \+w it\+w*?\wj*

\v 20 And again Jesus said, \wj ‘\+w To\+w* \+w what\+w* \+w can\+w* \+w I\+w* liken \+w the\+w* kingdom \+w of\+w* \+w God\+w*?\wj*

\v 22 Jesus went through towns and villages, teaching as he went, and making his way towards Jerusalem. 
\v 23 ‘Master,’ someone asked, ‘are there but few in the path of salvation?’ And Jesus answered,

\v 1 On one occasion, as Jesus was going, on a Sabbath into the house of one of the leading Pharisees to dine, they were watching him closely. 
\v 2 There he saw before him a man who was suffering from dropsy. 
\v 3  \wj ‘\+w Is\+w* \+w it\+w* allowable,’\wj* said Jesus, addressing the students of the Law and the Pharisees, \wj ‘\+w to\+w* work \+w a\+w* \+w cure\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Sabbath\+w*, \+w or\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w not\+w*?’\wj* 
\v 4 They remained silent. Jesus took hold of the man and cured him, and sent him away. 
\v 5 And he said to them, \wj ‘\+w Which\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w you\+w*, finding \+w that\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w son\+w* \+w or\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w ox\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w fallen\+w* \+w into\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w well\+w*, \+w will\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w immediately\+w* pull \+w them\+w* \+w out\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Sabbath\+w* \+w day\+w*?’\wj* 
\v 6 And they could not make any answer to that.

\v 7 Observing that the guests were choosing the best places for themselves, Jesus told them this parable –

\v 11 On the way to Jerusalem Jesus passed between Samaria and Galilee. 
\v 12 As he was entering a village, ten lepers met him. 
\v 13 Standing still, some distance off, they called out loudly, ‘Jesus! Sir! Pity us!’

\v 15 One of them, finding he was cured, came back, praising God loudly, 
\v 16 and threw himself on his face at Jesus’ feet, thanking him for what he had done; and this man was a Samaritan.

\v 26 ‘Then who can be saved?’ asked those who heard this.

\v 31 Gathering the Twelve round him, Jesus said to them, \wj ‘\+w Listen\+w*! \+w We\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w going\+w* \+w up\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w Jerusalem\+w*; \+w and\+w* \+w there\+w* \+w everything\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w written\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w prophets\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w be\+w* done \+w to\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Son\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Man\+w*.\wj*

\v 34 The apostles did not comprehend any of this. His meaning was unintelligible to them and they did not understand what he was saying.

\p
\v 35 As Jesus was getting near Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside, begging. 
\v 36 Hearing a crowd going by, the man asked what was the matter; 
\v 37 and, when people told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing, 
\v 38 he shouted out, ‘Jesus, Son of David, take pity on me!’ 
\v 39 Those who were in front kept telling him to be quiet, but he continued to call out the louder, ‘Son of David, take pity on me!’ 
\v 40 Then Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to him. And, when he had come close up to him, Jesus asked him, 
\v 41  \wj ‘\+w What\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w want\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w you\+w*?’\wj* 
\p ‘Master,’ he said, ‘I want to recover my sight.’ 
\v 42 And Jesus said, \wj ‘\+w Recover\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w sight\+w*, \+w your\+w* \+w faith\+w* \+w has\+w* delivered \+w you\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 43 Instantly he recovered his sight, and began to follow Jesus, praising God. And all the people, on seeing it, gave glory to God. 
\c 19  
\b
\p
\v 1 Jesus entered Jericho and made his way through the town. 
\v 2 There was a man there, known by the name of Zacchaeus, who was a senior tax collector and a rich man. 
\v 3 He tried to see what Jesus was like; but, being short, he was unable to do so because of the crowd. 
\v 4 So he ran on ahead and climbed into a mulberry tree to see Jesus, for he knew that he must pass that way. 
\v 5 When Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, \wj ‘\+w Zacchaeus\+w*, \+w be\+w* quick \+w and\+w* \+w come\+w* \+w down\+w*, \+w for\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w must\+w* stop \+w at\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w house\+w* \+w today\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 6 So Zacchaeus got down quickly, and joyfully welcomed him. 
\v 7 On seeing this, everyone began to complain, ‘He has gone to stay with a man who is an outcast.’ 
\v 8 But Zacchaeus stood forward and said to the Master, ‘Listen, Master! I will give half my property to the poor, and, if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I will give him back four times as much.’ 
\p
\v 9  \wj ‘\+w Salvation\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w come\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w this\+w* \+w house\+w* \+w today\+w*,’\wj* answered Jesus, \wj ‘\+w for\+w* \+w even\+w* \+w this\+w* \+w man\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w son\+w* \+w of\+w* Abraham.\wj*

\p
\v 11 As the people were listening to this, Jesus went on to tell them a parable. He did so because he was near Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God was going to be proclaimed at once. 
\v 12 He said, \wj ‘\+w A\+w* \+w nobleman\+w* once \+w went\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w distant\+w* \+w country\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w receive\+w* \+w his\+w* appointment \+w to\+w* \+w a\+w* kingdom \+w and\+w* \+w then\+w* \+w return\+w*.\wj*

\p
\v 28 After saying this, Jesus went on in front, going up to Jerusalem. 
\s1 The Last Days 
\p
\v 29 It was when Jesus had almost reached Bethphage and Bethany, near the Mount of Olives, that he sent on two of the disciples. 
\v 30  \wj ‘\+w Go\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w village\+w* \+w facing\+w* \+w us\+w*,’\wj* he said, \wj ‘\+w and\+w*, \+w when\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w get\+w* \+w there\+w*, \+w you\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w find\+w* \+w a\+w* foal tethered, \+w which\+w* \+w no\+w* \+w one\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w yet\+w* ridden; \+w untie\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w lead\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w here\+w*.\wj* 
\v 31  \wj \+w And\+w*, \+w if\+w* anybody \+w asks\+w* \+w you\+w* “\+w Why\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w untying\+w* \+w it\+w*?”, \+w you\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w say\+w* \+w this\+w* – “\+w The\+w* \+w Master\+w* \+w wants\+w* \+w it\+w*.”’\wj* 
\v 32 So the two who were sent went and found it as Jesus had told them. 
\v 33 While they were untying the foal, the owners asked them – ‘Why are you untying the foal?’ 
\v 34 And the two disciples answered – ‘The Master wants it.’ 
\v 35 Then they led it back to Jesus, and threw their cloaks on the foal and put Jesus on it. 
\v 36 As he went along, the people kept spreading their cloaks in the road. 
\v 37 When he had almost reached the place where the road led down the Mount of Olives, everyone of the many disciples began in their joy to praise God loudly for all the miracles that they had seen: 
\q1
\v 38 ‘Blessed is He who comes – our king – in the name of the Lord! 
\q1 Peace in heaven, 
\q2 and glory on high.’ 
\m
\v 39 Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, ‘Teacher, restrain your disciples.’ 
\v 40 But Jesus answered, \wj ‘\+w I\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w if\+w* \+w they\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w silent\+w*, \+w the\+w* \+w stones\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w call\+w* \+w out\+w*.’\wj* 
\p
\v 41 When he drew near, on seeing the city, he wept over it, and said, 
\v 42  \wj ‘\+w If\+w* \+w only\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w had\+w* \+w known\+w*, \+w while\+w* \+w yet\+w* \+w there\+w* \+w was\+w* \+w time\+w* – \+w even\+w* \+w you\+w* – \+w the\+w* \+w things\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w make\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w peace\+w*! \+w But\+w* \+w now\+w* \+w they\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w been\+w* \+w hidden\+w* \+w from\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w sight\+w*.\wj* 
\v 43  \wj \+w For\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w time\+w* \+w is\+w* coming \+w when\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w enemies\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w surround\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w with\+w* earthworks, \+w and\+w* encircle \+w you\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w hem\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w all\+w* \+w sides\+w*;\wj*

\p
\v 45 Jesus went into the Temple Courts and began to drive out those who were selling, 
\v 46 saying as he did so, \wj ‘\+w Scripture\+w* \+w says\+w* – “\+w My\+w* \+w house\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w house\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w prayer\+w*”; \+w but\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w made\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w den\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w robbers\+w*.’\wj* 
\b
\p
\v 47 Jesus continued to teach each day in the Temple Courts; but the chief priests and teachers of the Law were eager to take his life, and so also were the leaders of the people. 
\v 48 Yet they could not see what to do, for the people all hung on his words. 
\c 20  
\b
\p
\v 1 On one of these days, when Jesus was teaching the people in the Temple Courts and telling the good news, the chief priests and the teachers of the Law, joined by the elders, confronted him, 
\v 2 and addressing him, said, ‘Tell us what authority you have to do these things. Who is it who has given you this authority?’ 
\p
\v 3  \wj ‘\+w I\+w*, \+w too\+w*,’\wj* said Jesus in reply, \wj ‘\+w will\+w* \+w ask\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w one\+w* \+w question\+w*. \+w Give\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w an\+w* \+w answer\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w it\+w*.\wj* 
\v 4  \wj \+w It\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w about\+w* \+w John\+w*’s baptism – \+w was\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w of\+w* divine \+w or\+w* \+w of\+w* human origin?’\wj* 
\v 5 But they began arguing together, ‘If we say “divine,” he will say “Why didn’t you believe him?” 
\v 6 But, if we say “human,” the people will all stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.’ 
\v 7 So they answered that they did not know its origin. 
\v 8  \wj ‘\+w Then\+w* \+w I\+w*,’\wj* said Jesus, \wj ‘refuse \+w to\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w what\+w* \+w authority\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w these\+w* \+w things\+w*.’\wj* 
\p
\v 9 But Jesus began to tell the people this parable – \wj ‘\+w A\+w* \+w man\+w* once \+w planted\+w* \+w a\+w* vineyard, \+w and\+w* \+w then\+w* \+w let\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w out\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w tenants\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w went\+w* abroad \+w for\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w long\+w* \+w while\+w*.\wj*

\p
\v 19 After this the teachers of the Law and the chief priest were eager to lay hands on Jesus then and there, but they were afraid of the people; for they saw that it was at them that he had aimed this parable. 
\v 20 Having watched their opportunity, they afterwards sent some spies, who pretended to be good men, to catch Jesus in the course of conversation, and so enable them to give him up to the Governor’s jurisdiction and authority. 
\v 21 These spies asked Jesus a question. They said, ‘Teacher, we know that you are right in what you say and teach, and that you do not take any account of a person’s position, but teach the way of God honestly; 
\v 22 are we right in paying tribute to the Emperor or not?’ 
\v 23 Seeing through their deceitfulness, Jesus said to them, 
\v 24  \wj ‘\+w Show\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w a\+w* coin. \+w Whose\+w* head \+w and\+w* title \+w are\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w it\+w*?’\wj*

\v 25 ‘The Emperor’s,’ they said; and Jesus replied, \wj ‘\+w Well\+w* \+w then\+w*, pay \+w to\+w* \+w the\+w* Emperor \+w what\+w* belongs \+w to\+w* \+w the\+w* Emperor, \+w and\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w God\+w* \+w what\+w* belongs \+w to\+w* \+w God\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 26 They could not object to this answer before the people; and, in their wonder at his reply, they held their tongues. 
\b
\p
\v 27 Presently there came up some Sadducees, who maintain that there is no resurrection. Their question was this – 
\v 28 ‘Teacher, Moses laid down for us in his writings that – 
\q1 “Should a man’s married brother die, and should he be childless, the man should take the widow as his wife, and raise up a family for his brother.” 
\m
\v 29 Well, there were once seven brothers; of whom the eldest, after taking a wife, died childless. 
\v 30 The second and third brothers both took her as their wife; 
\v 31 and so, too, did all seven – dying without children. 
\v 32 The woman herself was the last to die. 
\v 33 About the woman, then – at the resurrection, whose wife is she to be, all seven brothers having had her as their wife?’

\b
\p
\v 37 During the days, Jesus continued to teach in the Temple Courts, but he went out and spent the nights on the hill called the “Mount of Olives.” 
\v 38 And all the people would get up early in the morning and come to listen to him in the Temple Courts. 
\c 22  
\b
\p
\v 1 The feast of the unleavened bread, known as the Passover, was near. 
\v 2 The chief priest and the teachers of the Law were looking for an opportunity of destroying Jesus, for they were afraid of the people. 
\p
\v 3 Now Satan took possession of Judas, who was known as Iscariot, and who belonged to the Twelve; 
\v 4 and he went and discussed with the chief priests and officers in charge at the Temple the best way of betraying Jesus to them. 
\v 5 They were glad of this, and agreed to pay him. 
\v 6 So Judas assented, and looked for an opportunity to betray Jesus to them, in the absence of a crowd. 
\p
\v 7 When the day of the Festival of the unleavened bread came, on which the Passover lambs had to be killed, 
\v 8 Jesus sent forward Peter and John, saying to them, \wj ‘\+w Go\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w make\+w* preparations \+w for\+w* \+w our\+w* \+w eating\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Passover\+w*.’\wj* 
\p
\v 9 ‘Where do you wish us to make preparations?’ they asked. 
\v 10  \wj ‘\+w Listen\+w*,’\wj* he answered, \wj ‘\+w when\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w reached\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w city\+w*, \+w a\+w* \+w man\+w* carrying \+w a\+w* \+w pitcher\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w water\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w meet\+w* \+w you\+w*; \+w follow\+w* \+w him\+w* \+w into\+w* \+w whatever\+w* \+w house\+w* \+w he\+w* \+w enters\+w*;\wj*

\v 12  \wj \+w The\+w* man \+w will\+w* \+w show\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w large\+w* upstairs room, set \+w out\+w*; \+w there\+w* \+w make\+w* preparations.’\wj* 
\p
\v 13 So Peter and John went on, and found everything just as Jesus had told them, and they prepared the Passover. 
\p
\v 14 When the time came, Jesus took his place at the table, and the apostles with him. 
\v 15  \wj ‘\+w I\+w* \+w have\+w* most \+w earnestly\+w* wished,’\wj* he said, \wj ‘\+w to\+w* \+w eat\+w* \+w this\+w* \+w Passover\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w before\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w suffer\+w*.\wj* 
\v 16  \wj \+w For\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w eat\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w again\+w*, \+w until\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w had\+w* \+w its\+w* fulfilment \+w in\+w* \+w the\+w* kingdom \+w of\+w* \+w God\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 17 Then, on receiving a cup, after saying the thanksgiving, he said, \wj ‘\+w Take\+w* \+w this\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w share\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w among\+w* \+w you\+w*.\wj* 
\v 18  \wj \+w For\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w not\+w*, \+w after\+w* today, \+w drink\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w fruit\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* vine, \+w until\+w* \+w the\+w* kingdom \+w of\+w* \+w God\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w come\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 19 Then Jesus took some bread, and, after saying the thanksgiving, broke it and gave to them, with the words, \wj ‘\+w This\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w body\+w*.\wj* 
\v 20  \f + \fr 22.20  \ft Some later manuscripts add: which is now to be given on your behalf. Do this in memory of me. And in the same way with the cup, after supper, saying: ‘This cup is the New Covenant made by my blood which is being poured out on your behalf.’\f* 
\v 21  \wj \+w Yet\+w* \+w see\+w*! \+w The\+w* \+w hand\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* man \+w who\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w betraying\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w beside\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w table\+w*!\wj*

\v 23 Then they began questioning one another which of them it could be who was going to do this. 
\p
\v 24 And a dispute arose among them as to which of them was to be regarded as the greatest. 
\v 25 Jesus, however, said, \wj ‘\+w The\+w* \+w kings\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Gentiles\+w* \+w lord\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w over\+w* \+w them\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w their\+w* oppressors \+w are\+w* styled “\+w Benefactors\+w*.”\wj*

\v 33 ‘Master,’ said Peter, ‘with you I am ready to go both to prison and to death.’ 
\p
\v 34  \wj ‘\+w I\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w*, \+w Peter\+w*,’\wj* replied Jesus, \wj ‘\+w the\+w* cock \+w will\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w crow\+w* \+w today\+w* \+w until\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w have\+w* disowned \+w all\+w* \+w knowledge\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w three\+w* \+w times\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 35 Then he said to them all, \wj ‘\+w When\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w sent\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w out\+w* \+w as\+w* \+w my\+w* messengers, \+w without\+w* \+w either\+w* purse, \+w or\+w* \+w bag\+w*, \+w or\+w* \+w sandals\+w*, \+w were\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w need\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w anything\+w*?’\wj* 
\p ‘No; nothing,’ they answered. 
\v 36  \wj ‘\+w Now\+w*, \+w however\+w*,’\wj* he said, \wj ‘\+w he\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w a\+w* purse \+w must\+w* \+w take\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w his\+w* \+w bag\+w* \+w as\+w* \+w well\+w*; \+w and\+w* \+w he\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w must\+w* \+w sell\+w* \+w his\+w* \+w cloak\+w* \+w and\+w* buy \+w a\+w* \+w sword\+w*.\wj*

\p
\v 38 ‘Master,’ they exclaimed, ‘look, here are two swords!’ 
\p \wj ‘\+w Enough\+w*!’\wj* said Jesus. 
\b
\p
\v 39 Jesus then went out, and made his way as usual to the Mount of Olives, followed by his disciples. 
\v 40 And, when he reached the spot, he said to them, \wj ‘\+w Pray\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w may\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w fall\+w* \+w into\+w* \+w temptation\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 41 Then he withdrew about a stone’s throw, and knelt down and began to pray. 
\v 42  \wj ‘\+w Father\+w*,’\wj* he said, \wj ‘\+w if\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w pleasure\+w*, spare \+w me\+w* \+w this\+w* \+w cup\+w*; \+w only\+w*, \+w not\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w but\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w done\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 43 Presently there appeared to him an angel from heaven, who strengthened him.\f + \fr 22.43  \ft Some later manuscripts do not contain verses 43 or 44.\f* 
\v 44 And, as his anguish became intense, he prayed still more earnestly, while his sweat was like great drops of blood falling on the ground. 
\v 45 Then he rose from praying, and came to the disciples and found them sleeping for sorrow. 
\v 46  \wj ‘\+w Why\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w asleep\+w*?’\wj* he asked them. \wj ‘Rise \+w and\+w* \+w pray\+w* \+w so\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w you\+w* don’t \+w fall\+w* \+w into\+w* \+w temptation\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 47 While he was still speaking, a crowd appeared in sight, led by the man called Judas, who was one of the Twelve. Judas approached Jesus, to kiss him; 
\v 48 at which Jesus said to him, \wj ‘\+w Judas\+w*, \+w is\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w by\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w kiss\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w betray\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Son\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Man\+w*?’\wj* 
\v 49 But when those who were round Jesus saw what was going to happen, they exclaimed, ‘Master, should we use our swords?’ 
\v 50 And one of them struck the high priest’s servant and cut off his right ear; 
\v 51 at which Jesus said, \wj ‘\+w Let\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w at\+w* least \+w do\+w* \+w this\+w*’; \+w and\+w*, touching \+w his\+w* \+w ear\+w*, \+w he\+w* \+w healed\+w* \+w the\+w* wound.\wj* 
\v 52 Then, turning to the chief priests and officers in charge at the Temple and the elders, who had come for him, he said, \wj ‘\+w Have\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w come\+w* \+w out\+w*, \+w as\+w* \+w if\+w* \+w after\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w robber\+w*, \+w with\+w* \+w swords\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w clubs\+w*?\wj* 
\v 53  \wj \+w When\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w was\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w day\+w* \+w after\+w* \+w day\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Temple\+w* Courts, \+w you\+w* \+w did\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w lay\+w* \+w hands\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w me\+w*; \+w but\+w* \+w now\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w time\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w come\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w power\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w darkness\+w*.’\wj* 
\b
\p
\v 54 Those who had taken Jesus prisoner took him away into the house of the high priest. Peter followed at a distance. 
\v 55 But, when they had lit a fire in the centre of the courtyard and had all sat down there, Peter seated himself in the middle of them. 
\v 56 Presently a maidservant saw him sitting near the blaze of the fire. She looked carefully at him and said, ‘Why, this man was one of his companions!’ 
\v 57 But Peter denied it. ‘I do not know him,’ he replied. 
\v 58 A little while afterwards someone else – a man – saw him and said, ‘Why, you are one of them!’ 
\p ‘No,’ Peter said, ‘I am not.’ 
\v 59 About an hour later another man declared positively, ‘This man also was certainly with him. Why, he is a Galilean!’ 
\v 60 But Peter said, ‘I do not know what you are speaking about.’ Instantly, while he was still speaking, a cock crowed. 
\v 61 And the Master turned and looked at Peter; and Peter remembered the words that the Master had said to him – \wj ‘\+w Before\+w* \+w a\+w* cock \+w has\+w* \+w crowed\+w* \+w today\+w*, \+w you\+w* \+w will\+w* disown \+w me\+w* \+w three\+w* \+w times\+w*’;\wj* 
\v 62 and he went outside and wept bitterly. 
\b
\p
\v 63 The men who held Jesus kept making sport of him and beating him. 
\v 64 They blindfolded him and then questioned him. ‘Now play the prophet,’ they said. ‘Who was it that struck you?’ 
\v 65 And they heaped many other insults on him. 
\b
\p
\v 66 At daybreak the assembly of the elders of the people met – both the chief priests and the teachers of the Law – and took Jesus before their High Council. 
\v 67 ‘If you are the Christ,’ they said, ‘tell us so.’ 
\p \wj ‘\+w If\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w*,’\wj* replied Jesus, \wj ‘\+w you\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w believe\+w* \+w me\+w*;\wj* 
\v 68  \wj \+w and\+w*, \+w if\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w question\+w* \+w you\+w*, \+w you\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w not\+w* answer.\wj* 
\v 69  \wj \+w But\+w* \+w from\+w* \+w this\+w* hour \+w the\+w* \+w Son\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Man\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w seated\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w right\+w* \+w hand\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w God\+w* Almighty.’\wj* 
\p
\v 70 ‘Are you, then, the Son of God?’ they all asked. \wj ‘\+w It\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w true\+w*,’\wj* answered Jesus, \wj ‘\+w I\+w* \+w am\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 71 At this they exclaimed, ‘Why do we want any more evidence? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips!’ 
\c 23  
\p
\v 1 Then they all rose in a body and led Jesus before Pilate. 
\v 2 And they began to accuse him, ‘This is a man whom we found misleading our people, preventing them from paying taxes to the Emperor, and giving out that he himself is “Christ, a king.”’ 
\p
\v 3 ‘Are you the king of the Jews?’ Pilate asked him. \wj ‘\+w It\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w true\+w*,’\wj* replied Jesus. 
\v 4 But Pilate, turning to the chief priests and the people, said, ‘I do not see anything to find fault with in this man.’ 
\v 5 But they insisted, ‘He is stirring up the people by his teaching all through Judea; he began with Galilee and has now come here.’ 
\v 6 Hearing this, Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean; 
\v 7 and, having satisfied himself that Jesus came under Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who also was at Jerusalem at the time. 
\v 8 When Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly pleased, for he had been wanting to see him for a long time, having heard a great deal about him; and he was hoping to see some sign given by him. 
\v 9 So he questioned him at some length, but Jesus made no reply. 
\v 10 Meanwhile the chief priests and the teachers of the Law stood by and vehemently accused him. 
\v 11 And Herod, with his soldiers, treated Jesus with scorn; he mocked him by throwing a gorgeous robe round him, and then sent him back to Pilate. 
\v 12 And Herod and Pilate became friends that very day, for before that there had been ill-will between them. 
\p
\v 13 So Pilate summoned the chief priests, and the leading men, and the people, 
\v 14 and said to them, ‘You brought this man before me charged with misleading the people; and yet, for my part, though I examined him before you, I did not find this man to blame for any of the things of which you accuse him; 
\v 15 nor did Herod either; for he has sent him back to us. And, as a fact, he has not done anything deserving death; 
\v 16 so I will have him scourged, and then release him.’ 
\v 17  \f + \fr 23.17  \ft Some later manuscripts add: He had to release someone to them at the feast.\f* 
\v 18 But they began to shout as one man, ‘Kill this fellow, but release Barabbas for us.’ 
\v 19 (Barabbas was a man who had been put in prison for a riot that had broken out in the city and for murder.) 
\v 20 Pilate, however, wanting to release Jesus, called to them again; 
\v 21 but they kept calling out, ‘Crucify, crucify him!’ 
\p
\v 22 ‘Why, what harm has this man done?’ Pilate said to them for the third time. ‘I have found nothing in him for which he could be condemned to death. So I will have him scourged, and then release him.’ 
\v 23 But they persisted in loudly demanding his crucifixion; and their clamour gained the day. 
\v 24 Pilate decided that their demand should be granted. 
\v 25 He released the man who had been put in prison for riot and murder, as they demanded, and gave Jesus up to be dealt with as they pleased. 
\b
\p
\v 26 And, as they were leading Jesus away, they laid hold of Simon from Cyrene, who was on his way in from the country, and they put the cross on his shoulders, for him to carry it behind Jesus. 
\v 27 There was a great crowd of people following him, many being women who were beating their breasts and wailing for him. 
\v 28 So Jesus turned and said to them, \wj ‘Women \+w of\+w* \+w Jerusalem\+w*, \+w do\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w weep\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w me\+w*, \+w but\+w* \+w weep\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w yourselves\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w for\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w children\+w*.\wj* 
\v 29  \wj \+w A\+w* \+w time\+w*, \+w I\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w*, \+w is\+w* \+w coming\+w*, \+w when\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w said\+w* – “\+w Happy\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w the\+w* women \+w who\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w barren\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w those\+w* \+w who\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w never\+w* borne \+w children\+w* \+w or\+w* \+w nursed\+w* \+w them\+w*!”\wj* 
\v 30  \wj \+w At\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w time\+w* \+w people\+w* \+w will\+w* begin \+w to\+w* \+w say\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w mountains\+w* “\+w Fall\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w us\+w*,” \+w and\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w hills\+w* “\+w Cover\+w* \+w us\+w*.”\wj* 
\v 31  \wj \+w If\+w* \+w what\+w* \+w you\+w* see \+w is\+w* \+w done\+w* \+w while\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w tree\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w green\+w*, \+w what\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w happen\+w* \+w when\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w dry\+w*?’\wj* 
\v 32 There were two others also, criminals, led out to be executed with Jesus. 
\v 33 When they had reached the place called “The Skull,” there they crucified Jesus and the criminals, one on the right, and one on the left. 
\v 34 Then Jesus said, \wj ‘\+w Father\+w*, forgive \+w them\+w*; \+w they\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w know\+w* \+w what\+w* \+w they\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w doing\+w*.’\wj* His clothes they divided among them by casting lots. 
\v 35 Meanwhile the people stood looking on. Even the leading men said with a sneer, ‘He saved others, let him save himself, if he is God’s Christ, his chosen one.’ 
\v 36 The soldiers, too, came up in mockery, bringing him common wine, 
\v 37 and saying as they did so, ‘If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself.’ 
\v 38 Above him were the words – 
\q1 “THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.” 
\m
\v 39 One of the criminals who were hanging beside Jesus railed at him. ‘Aren’t you the Christ? Save yourself and us,’ he said. 
\v 40 But the other rebuked him. ‘Haven’t you,’ he said, ‘any fear of God, now that you are under the same sentence? 
\v 41 And we justly so, for we are only reaping our deserts, but this man has not done anything wrong. 
\v 42 Jesus,’ he went on, ‘do not forget me when you have come to your kingdom.’ 
\v 43 And Jesus answered, \wj ‘\+w I\+w* \+w tell\+w* \+w you\+w*, \+w this\+w* \+w very\+w* \+w day\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w Paradise\+w*.’\wj* 
\p
\v 44 It was nearly midday, when a darkness came over the whole country, lasting until three in the afternoon, 
\v 45 the sun being eclipsed; and the Temple curtain was torn down the middle. 
\v 46 Then Jesus, with a loud cry, said, \wj ‘\+w Father\+w*, \+w into\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w hands\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w commit\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w spirit\+w*.’\wj* And with these words he expired. 
\v 47 The Roman centurion, on seeing what had happened, praised God, exclaiming, ‘This must have been a good man!’ 
\v 48 All the people who had collected to see the sight watched what occurred, and then went home beating their breasts. 
\v 49 All the friends of Jesus had been standing at a distance, with the women who accompanied him from Galilee, watching all this. 
\b
\p
\v 50 Now there was a man of the name of Joseph, who was a member of the Council, and who bore a good and upright character. 
\v 51 (This man had not assented to the decision and action of the Council.) He belonged to Arimathea, a town in Judea, and lived in expectation of the kingdom of God. 
\v 52 He now went to see Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus; 
\v 53 and, when he had taken it down, he wrapped it in a linen sheet, and laid him in a tomb cut out of stone, in which no one had yet been buried. 
\v 54 It was the Preparation day, and just before the Sabbath began. 
\v 55 The women who had accompanied Jesus from Galilee followed, and saw the tomb and how the body of Jesus was laid, 
\v 56 and then went home, and prepared spices and perfumes. 
\s1 The Risen Life 
\p During the Sabbath they rested, as directed by the commandment. 
\c 24  
\p
\v 1 But very early on the first day of the week they went to the tomb, taking with them the spices that they had prepared. 
\v 2 They found that the stone had been rolled away from the tomb; 
\v 3 and, on going into it, they could not find the body\f + \fr 24.3  \ft Some later manuscripts add: of the Lord Jesus.\f*. 
\v 4 While they were at a loss to account for this, all at once two men stood beside them, in dazzling clothing. 
\v 5 But, when in their fear the women bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, ‘Why are you looking among the dead for him who is living? 
\v 6  \f + \fr 24.6  \ft Some later manuscripts add: He is not here but he has risen.\f* Remember how he spoke to you before he left Galilee – 
\v 7 How he said that the Son of Man must be betrayed into the hands of wicked men, and be crucified, and rise again on the third day.’ 
\v 8 Then they remembered the words of Jesus, 
\v 9 and, on returning from the tomb, they told all this to the Eleven and to all the rest. 
\v 10 There were Mary of Magdala, and Joanna, and Mary, the mother of James. The other women, too, spoke about this to the apostles. 
\v 11 What they said seemed to the apostles mere nonsense, and they did not believe them. 
\v 12  \f + \fr 24.12  \ft Some later manuscripts add: Peter got up and ran to the tomb. Stooping down he saw nothing but the linen wrappings, and he went away, wondering to himself at what had taken place.\f* 
\b
\p
\v 13 It happened that very day that two of the disciples were going to a village called Emmaus, which was about seven miles from Jerusalem, 
\v 14 talking together, as they went, about all that had just taken place. 
\v 15 While they were talking about these things and discussing them, Jesus himself came up and went on their way with them; 
\v 16 but their eyes were blinded so that they could not recognise him. 
\v 17  \wj ‘\+w What\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w this\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w saying\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w each\+w* \+w other\+w* \+w as\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w walk\+w* \+w along\+w*?’\wj* Jesus asked. They stopped, with sad looks on their faces, 
\v 18 and then one of them, whose name was Cleopas, said to Jesus, ‘Are you staying by yourself at Jerusalem, that you have not heard of the things that have happened there within the last few days?’ 
\p
\v 19  \wj ‘\+w What\+w* \+w things\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w mean\+w*?’\wj* asked Jesus. ‘Why, about Jesus of Nazareth,’ they answered, ‘who, in the eyes of God and all the people, was a prophet, whose power was felt in both his words and actions; 
\v 20 and how the chief priests and our leading men gave him up to be sentenced to death, and afterwards crucified him. 
\v 21 But we were hoping that he was the Destined Deliverer of Israel; yes, and besides all this, it is now three days since these things occurred. 
\v 22 And what is more, some of the women among us have greatly astonished us. They went to the tomb at daybreak 
\v 23 And, not finding the body of Jesus there, came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels who told them that he was alive. 
\v 24 So some of our number went to the tomb and found everything just as the women had said, but they did not see Jesus.’ 
\p
\v 25 Then Jesus said to them, \wj ‘\+w Foolish\+w* \+w men\+w*, \+w slow\+w* \+w to\+w* accept \+w all\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w prophets\+w* \+w have\+w* \+w said\+w*!\wj* 
\v 26  \wj \+w Was\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Christ\+w* bound \+w to\+w* undergo \+w this\+w* \+w suffering\+w* \+w before\+w* \+w entering\+w* \+w into\+w* \+w his\+w* \+w glory\+w*?’\wj* 
\v 27 Then, beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he explained to them all through the scriptures the passages that referred to himself. 
\v 28 When they got near the village to which they were walking, Jesus appeared to be going further; 
\v 29 but they pressed him not to do so. ‘Stay with us,’ they said, ‘for it is getting towards evening, and the sun in already low.’ So Jesus went in to stay with them. 
\v 30 After he had taken his place at the table with them, he took the bread and said the blessing, and broke it, and gave it to them. 
\v 31 Then their eyes were opened and they recognised him; but he disappeared from their sight. 
\v 32 ‘How our hearts glowed,’ the disciples said to each other, ‘while he was talking to us on the road, and when he explained the scriptures to us!’ 
\p
\v 33 Then they immediately got up and returned to Jerusalem, where they found the Eleven and their companions all together, 
\v 34 who told them that the Master had really risen, and had appeared to Simon. 
\v 35 So they also related what had happened during their walk, and how they had recognised Jesus at the breaking of the bread. 
\v 36 While they were still talking about these things, Jesus himself stood among them.\f + \fr 24.36  \ft Some later manuscripts add: and said, ‘Peace be with you.’\f* 
\v 37 In their terror and alarm they thought they saw a ghost, 
\v 38 but Jesus said to them, \wj ‘\+w Why\+w* \+w are\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w so\+w* startled? \+w And\+w* \+w why\+w* \+w do\+w* \+w doubts\+w* arise \+w in\+w* \+w your\+w* \+w minds\+w*?\wj* 
\v 39  \wj \+w Look\+w* \+w at\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w hands\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w my\+w* \+w feet\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w will\+w* know \+w that\+w* \+w it\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w I\+w*. Feel \+w me\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w look\+w* \+w at\+w* \+w me\+w*, \+w for\+w* \+w a\+w* \+w ghost\+w* \+w has\+w* \+w not\+w* \+w flesh\+w* \+w and\+w* \+w bones\+w*, \+w as\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w see\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w have\+w*.’\wj* 
\v 40  \f + \fr 24.40  \ft Some later manuscripts add: After saying this he showed them his hands and his feet.\f* 
\v 41 While they were still unable to believe it all, overcome with joy, and were wondering if it were true, Jesus said to them, \wj ‘\+w Have\+w* \+w you\+w* \+w anything\+w* \+w here\+w* \+w to\+w* \+w eat\+w*?’\wj* 
\v 42 They handed him a piece of broiled fish, 
\v 43 and he took it and ate it before their eyes. 
\v 44  \wj ‘\+w This\+w* \+w is\+w* \+w what\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w told\+w* \+w you\+w*,’\wj* he said, \wj ‘\+w when\+w* \+w I\+w* \+w was\+w* \+w still\+w* \+w with\+w* \+w you\+w* – \+w that\+w* \+w everything\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w had\+w* \+w been\+w* \+w written\+w* \+w about\+w* \+w me\+w* \+w in\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Law\+w* \+w of\+w* \+w Moses\+w*, \+w the\+w* \+w prophets\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Psalms\+w*, \+w must\+w* \+w be\+w* \+w fulfilled\+w*.’\wj* 
\p
\v 45 Then he enabled them to understand the meaning of the scriptures, saying to them, 
\v 46  \wj ‘\+w Scripture\+w* \+w says\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w Christ\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w suffer\+w*, \+w and\+w* \+w that\+w* \+w he\+w* \+w will\+w* \+w rise\+w* \+w again\+w* \+w from\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w dead\+w* \+w on\+w* \+w the\+w* \+w third\+w* \+w day\+w*,\wj*

\p
\v 50 After this, Jesus led them out as far as Bethany, and there raised his hands and blessed them. 
\v 51 As he was in the act of blessing them, he left them.\f + \fr 24.51  \ft Some later manuscripts add: and was carried up into heaven.\f* 
\v 52 They returned\f + \fr 24.52  \ft Some later manuscripts read: They bowed to the ground before him and returned.\f* to Jerusalem full of joy;
