\v 1 And it came to pass after the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord, that the Lord spoke unto Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, pass over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, to the children of Israel. 
\v 3 Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses. 
\v 4 From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your boundary. 
\v 5 No man shall be able to stand up before thee all the days of thy life; as I was with Moses, so will I be with thee: I will not let thee fail, nor forsake thee. 
\v 6 Be strong and of a good courage; for thou shalt divide for an inheritance unto this people the land, which I swore unto their fathers to give to them. 
\v 7 Only be thou strong and very courageous, to observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant hath commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left; in order that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest. 
\v 8 This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, in order that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein; for then shalt thou make thy way prosperous, and then shalt thou have good success. 
\v 9 Behold, I have commanded thee, Be strong and of good courage; be not dismayed, neither be thou discouraged; for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest. 
\v 10 Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying, 
\v 11 Pass through the midst of the camp, and command the people, saying, Prepare yourselves provisions; for after only three days more ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the Lord your God giveth you, to possess it. 
\v 12 And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Menasseh, spoke Joshua, saying, 
\v 13 Remember the word which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you, saying, The Lord your God hath granted you rest, and hath given you this land; 
\v 14 Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan; but ye shall pass over armed before your brethren, all the mighty men of valor, and help them; 
\v 15 Until the Lord shall have granted your brethren rest, as he hath done to you, and they also have taken possession of the land which the Lord your God giveth them: then shall ye return unto the land of your possession, and possess it, which Moses the servant of the Lord gave you on this side of the Jordan, toward the rising of the sun. 
\v 16 And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou hast commanded us will we do, and whithersoever thou wilt send us will we go. 
\v 17 Entirely so as we have hearkened unto Moses, thus will we hearken unto thee: only the Lord thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses. 
\v 18 Every man that doth rebel against thy order, and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou mayest command him, shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage.

\v 1 And Joshua, the son of Nun, had sent out from Shittim two men as spies, secretly, saying, Go ye, view the land and especially Jericho; and they went, and came unto the house of a woman, a harlot, whose name was Rachab, and they lodged there. 
\v 2 And it was told unto the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, men came in hither this night, of the children of Israel, to search out the country. 
\v 3 And the king of Jericho sent to Rachab, saying, Bring forth the men who are come to thee, who came to thy house; for, to search out all the country are they come. 
\v 4 But the woman had taken the two men, and hidden them; and she said, It is true, the men came unto me, but I knew not whence they were. 
\v 5 And it came to pass, about the time of shutting the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out; I know not whither the men are gone: pursue quickly after them, for ye can overtake them. 
\v 6 But she had brought them up to the roof, and had hidden them among the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof. 
\v 7 And the men pursued after them, by the way to the Jordan unto the fords; and the gate was closed, as soon as those who pursued after them were gone out. 
\v 8 But they had not yet laid themselves down, when she came up unto them upon the roof. 
\v 9 And she said unto them, I know that the Lord hath given you the land, and that the terror of you hath fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land are become faint-hearted, because of you. 
\v 10 For we have heard, how that the Lord dried up the waters of the Red Sea before you, when ye went forth out of Egypt; and what ye have done unto the two kings of the Emorites, who were on the other side of the Jordan, unto Sichon and 'Og, whom ye have utterly destroyed. 
\v 11 And when we heard this, our heart melted, and there remained not any more courage in any man, because of you; for the Lord your God is alone God in the heavens above, and upon the earth beneath. 
\v 12 And now swear, I pray you, unto me by the Lord, because I have shown you kindness, that ye will also, for your part, show kindness, unto my father's house; and give me a sure token, 
\v 13 That ye will preserve the life of my father, and my mother, and my brothers, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death. 
\v 14 And the men said unto her, Our life shall be [doomed] to death instead of yours, if ye tell not this our business; and it shall be, when the Lord giveth us the land, that we will show thee kindness and truth. 
\v 15 Then she let them down by a cord through the window; for her house was within the town wall, and within the wall she dwelt. 
\v 16 And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet with you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned; and afterward ye may go your way. 
\v 17 And the men said unto her, We will be blameless of this thy oath which thou hast caused us to swear. 
\v 18 Behold, when we come into the land, this line of scarlet thread shalt thou bind in the window by which thou hast let us down; and thy father, and thy mother, and thy brothers, and all thy father's household, thou must bring together unto thee into the house. 
\v 19 And it shall be, that whosoever will go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we will be guiltless; and whosoever will remain with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if a hand be laid upon him. 
\v 20 And if thou tell this our business, then will we be free of thy oath which thou hast caused us to swear. 
\v 21 And she said, According unto your words, so be it; and she dismissed them, and they departed; and she bound the scarlet line in the window. 
\v 22 And they went, and came unto the mountain, and they remained there three days, until the pursuers were returned; and the pursuers sought throughout all the way, but found nothing. 
\v 23 And the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and related to him all the things that had befallen them. 
\v 24 And they said unto Joshua, Truly the Lord hath given up into our hand all the country; for all the inhabitants of the country are already become faint-hearted because of us. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they broke up from Shittim, and came close to the Jordan, he and all the children of Israel; and they lodged there before they passed over. 
\v 2 And it came to pass at the end of three days, that the officers passed through the midst of the camp. 
\v 3 And they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then shall ye break up from your place, and go after it. 
\v 4 Nevertheless there shall be a space between you and it, of about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, in order that ye may know the way by which ye must go; for ye have not passed this way heretofore. 
\v 5 And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves; for tomorrow will the Lord do wonders in the midst of you. 
\v 6 And Joshua said unto the priests, as followeth, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people. 
\v 7 And the Lord said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to make thee great in the eyes of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so will I be with thee. 
\v 8 And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the waters of the Jordan, ye shall stand still in the Jordan. 
\v 9 And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Approach hither, and hear the words of the Lord your God. 
\v 10 And Joshua said, Hereby shall ye know that the living God is in the midst of you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Emorites, and the Jebusites. 
\v 11 Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into the Jordan. 
\v 12 And now take yourselves twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, one man each out of every tribe. 
\v 13 And it shall come to pass, that as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the Lord, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan shall be cut off, namely, the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand up as a wall. 
\v 14 And it came to pass, when the people broke up from their tents, to pass over the Jordan, and the priests the bearers of the ark of the covenant were before the people; 
\v 15 And as they that bore the ark were come up to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bore the ark were dipped in the edge of the water, [the Jordan, however, had overflowed all its banks all the time of harvest,] 
\v 16 That the waters which came down from above stood still and rose up as a wall, very far from the city Adam, which is beside Zarethan; and those that ran down toward the sea of the plain, the salt sea, failed, were cut off; and the people passed over opposite to Jericho. 
\v 17 And the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people had finished passing over the Jordan. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass, when all the people had finished passing over the Jordan, That the Lord said unto Joshua, as followeth, 
\v 2 Take yourselves twelve men out of the people, one man each out of every tribe, 
\v 3 And command ye them, saying, Take yourselves hence out of the midst of the Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood firmly, twelve stones, and ye shall carry them over with you, and leave them in the lodging-place, where ye will lodge this night. 
\v 4 Then did Joshua call the twelve men, whom he had appointed out of the children of Israel, one man each out of every tribe: 
\v 5 And Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of the Lord your God into the midst of the Jordan, and take yourselves up every man one stone upon his shoulder, according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel; 
\v 6 In order that this may be a sign among you, when your children ask in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these stones? 
\v 7 That ye shall answer them, That the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the Lord; when it passed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off; and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever. 
\v 8 And the children of Israel did so as Joshua had commanded; and they took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, as the Lord had spoken unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel; and they carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged, and laid them down there. 
\v 9 Twelve stones also did Joshua set up in the midst of the Jordan, on the spot where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant had stood: and they have remained there unto this day. 
\v 10 But the priests who bore the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan, until every thing was finished that the Lord had commanded Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses had commanded Joshua; and the people hastened and passed over. 
\v 11 And it came to pass, when all the people had finished passing over, that the ark of the Lord passed over with the priests in the presence of the people. 
\v 12 And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Menasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses had spoken unto them: 
\v 13 About forty thousand ready armed for war, did they pass over before the Lord unto battle, to the plains of Jericho. 
\v 14 On that day the Lord made Joshua great in the eyes of all Israel; and they feared him, as they had feared Moses, all the days of his life. 
\v 15 And the Lord said unto Joshua, as followeth, 
\v 16 Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of the Jordan. 
\v 17 And Joshua commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of the Jordan. 
\v 18 And it came to pass, when the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord were come up out of the midst of the Jordan, the soles of the feet of the priests were lifted up unto the dry land, that the waters of the Jordan returned unto their place, and flowed over all its banks, as on the preceding days. 
\v 19 And the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, on the extreme eastern border of Jericho. 
\v 20 And those twelve stones, which they had taken out of the Jordan, did Joshua set up in Gilgal. 
\v 21 And he said unto the children of Israel, thus, When your children shall ask in time to come their fathers, saying, What mean these stones? 
\v 22 Then shall ye let your children know, saying, On dry land did Israel pass over this Jordan; 
\v 23 That the Lord your God dried up the waters of the Jordan from before you, until ye were passed over, as the Lord your God did to the Red Sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were gone over; 
\v 24 In order that all the nations of the earth may know the hand of the Lord, that it is mighty; in order that ye may fear the Lord your God all the days. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Emorites, who were on the side of the Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, who were by the sea, heard that the Lord had dried up the waters of the Jordan from before the children of Israel, until they were passed over, that their heart melted, and there remained no more any courage in them, because of the children of Israel. 
\v 2 At that time the Lord said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time. 
\v 3 And Joshua made himself sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of 'Araloth. 
\v 4 And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people that came out of Egypt, the males, all the men of war, died in the wilderness on the way, after their going forth out of Egypt. 
\v 5 For all the people that came out were circumcised; but all the people that were born in the wilderness on the way at their going forth out of Egypt, they had not circumcised. 
\v 6 For during forty years the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness, till there was an end of all the people, the men of war, who were come out of Egypt, who had not obeyed the voice of the Lord; unto whom the Lord had sworn that he would not let them see the land, which the Lord had sworn unto their fathers that he would give unto us, a land flowing with milk and honey. 
\v 7 But their children he raised up in their stead: these did Joshua circumcise; for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them on the way. 
\v 8 And it came to pass, when the whole people had all been circumcised, that they abode in their places in the camp till they were healed. 
\v 9 And the Lord said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. And he called the name of the place Gilgal unto this day. 
\v 10 And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and they prepared the passover-offering on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho. 
\v 11 And they ate of the corn of the land on the morrow after the passover-offering, unleavened cakes and parched corn, on the selfsame day. 
\v 12 And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the corn of the land; and the children of Israel had not any more manna; but they did eat of the product of the land of Canaan during that year. 
\v 13 And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, a man was standing over against him with his sword drawn in his hand; and Joshua went unto him, and said to him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries? 
\v 14 And he said, No; for I am a captain of the host of the Lord: now am I come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and bowed himself, and said to him, What doth my lord speak unto his servant? 
\v 15 And the captain of the Lord's host said unto Joshua, Put off thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did so. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1 Now Jericho was shut up, and barred up, because of the children of Israel: no one went out, and no one came in. 
\v 2 And the Lord said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thy hand Jericho and its king, even the mighty men of valor. 
\v 3 And ye shall compass the city, all the men of war, going round about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days. 
\v 4 And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven cornets of rams' horns; and on the seventh day shall ye compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the cornets. 
\v 5 And it shall come to pass, that, when they blow a long blast with the ram's horn, when ye hear the sound of the cornet all the people shall utter a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him. 
\v 6 And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven cornets of rams' horns before the ark of the Lord. 
\v 7 And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let the armed men pass on before the ark of the Lord. 
\v 8 And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that the seven priests, bearing the seven cornets of rams' horns before the Lord, passed on and blew with the cornets; and the ark of the covenant of the Lord followed them. 
\v 9 And the armed men went before the priests that blew the cornets, and the rereward came after the ark, going on, and blowing with the cornets. 
\v 10 And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor let your voice be heard, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you, Shout; and then shall ye shout. 
\v 11 So the ark of the Lord compassed the city, going round it once; and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp. 
\v 12 And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the Lord. 
\v 13 And the seven priests bearing the seven cornets of rams' horns before the ark of the Lord went on continually, and blew with the cornets; and the armed men went before them; and the rereward came after the ark of the Lord, going on, and blowing with the cornets. 
\v 14 And they compassed the city on the second day once, and returned into the camp: so did they six days. 
\v 15 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after this manner seven times; only on that day they compassed the city seven times. 
\v 16 And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priest blew with the cornets, that Joshua' said unto the people, Shout; for the Lord hath given you the city. 
\v 17 And the city shall be devoted, it, and all that is therein, to the Lord: only Rachab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house; because she did hide the messengers that we sent. 
\v 18 But ye, keep yourselves from the devoted things, lest ye devote and yet take of the devoted things, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it. 
\v 19 And all the silver, and gold, and vessels of copper and iron, shall be holy unto the Lord: into the treasury of the Lord shall they come. 
\v 20 So the people shouted, when they blew with the cornets; and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the cornet, that the people uttered a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, and the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they captured the city. 
\v 21 And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and lamb, and ass, with the edge of the sword. 
\v 22 But unto the two men that had spied out the country, Joshua said, Go into the house of the woman, the harlot, and bring out thence the woman, and all belonging to her, as ye have sworn unto her. 
\v 23 And the young men, the spies, went in, and brought out Rachab, and her father, and her mother, and her brothers, and all belonging to her: and they brought out all her kindred, and they left them without the camp of Israel. 
\v 24 And the city they burnt with fire, and all that was therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of copper and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the Lord. 
\v 25 And Rachab the harlot did Joshua save alive, and her father's household, and all belonging to her; and she dwelt in the midst of Israel even unto this day; because she had hidden the messengers, whom Joshua had sent to spy out Jericho. 
\v 26 And Joshua adjured [the people] at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before the Lord, that will rise up and build this city Jericho: with his first-born shall he lay its foundation, and with his youngest shall he set up its gates. 
\v 27 And the Lord was with Joshua; and his fame was spread throughout all the country. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1 But the children of Israel committed a trespass on the devoted things; for 'Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerach, of the tribe of Judah, took of the devoted things: and the anger of the Lord was kindled against the children of Israel. 
\v 2 And Joshua sent men from Jericho to 'Ai, which is beside Beth-aven, on the east side of Beth-el, and said unto them, thus, Go up and spy out the country. And the men went up and spied out 'Ai. 
\v 3 And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite 'Ai: do not fatigue all the people [to go] thither; for they are but few. 
\v 4 So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men; and they fled before the men of 'Ai. 
\v 5 And the men of 'Ai smote of them about thirty and six men; and they chased them from before the gate unto the stone-quarries, and smote them on the declivity [of the hill]; wherefore the heart of the people melted, and became as water. 
\v 6 And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell upon his face to the earth before the ark of the Lord until the evening, he with the elders of Israel, and they put dust upon their head. 
\v 7 And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord Eternal, wherefore hast thou caused this people to pass over the Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Emorites, to destroy us? and oh! that we had been content, and dwelt on the other side of the Jordan! 
\v 8 I pray thee, O Lord, what shall I say, since Israel have turned their back before their enemies! 
\v 9 And when the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, they will environ us round, and cut off our name from the earth; and what wilt thou do for thy great name? 
\v 10 And the Lord said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest thou upon thy face. 
\v 11 Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I have commanded them; and they have also taken of the devoted things, and have also stolen, and have also dissembled, and they have also put it into their own vessels. 
\v 12 Therefore will the children of Israel not be able to stand up before their enemies; their back will they turn before their enemies, because they have become accursed: I will not be any more with you, except ye destroy the accursed from among you. 
\v 13 Rise up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow; for thus hath said the Lord the God of Israel, An accursed thing is in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou shalt not be able to stand up before thy enemies, until ye have removed the accursed from among you. 
\v 14 And ye shall be brought near in the morning according to your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the Lord will seize shall come near according to its families; and the family which the Lord will seize shall come near by households; and the household which the Lord shall seize will come near by its men. 
\v 15 And it shall be, that he that is seized with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire, he, and all that he hath; because he hath transgressed the covenant of the Lord, and because he hath wrought wickedness in Israel. 
\v 16 So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel near by their tribes, and the tribe of Judah was seized; 
\v 17 And he brought near the family of Judah, and he seized the family of the Zarchites; and he brought near the family of the Zarchites by its men, and Zabdi was seized; 
\v 18 And he brought near his household by its men, and 'Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerach, of the tribe of Judah, was seized. 
\v 19 And Joshua said unto 'Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the Lord, the God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me, I pray thee, what thou hast done: hide nothing from me. 
\v 20 And 'Achan answered Joshua, and said, Truly! I have indeed sinned against the Lord the God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done: 
\v 21 I saw among the spoil a handsome Babylonish mantle, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels in weight, and I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hidden in the earth in the midst of my tent, with the silver beneath the same. 
\v 22 Joshua thereupon sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, it was hidden in his tent, and the silver beneath it. 
\v 23 And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and they laid them out before the Lord. 
\v 24 And Joshua took 'Achan the son of Zerach, and the silver, and the mantle, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his ox, and his ass, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had, and all Israel were with him, and they brought them up unto the valley of 'Achor. 
\v 25 And Joshua said, How hast thou troubled us! so shall the Lord trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burnt them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones. 
\v 26 And they raised over him a great heap of stones [which is] unto this day; and the Lord turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore the name of that place was called, The valley of 'Achor, unto this day. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou discouraged: take with thee all the people of war, and arise, go up to 'Ai; see, I have given into thy hand the king of 'Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land. 
\v 2 And thou shalt do to 'Ai and to its king as thou hast done unto Jericho and its king; only its spoil and its cattle shall ye take for booty unto yourselves; but lay thee an ambush for the city in its rear. 
\v 3 So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against 'Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valor, and sent them away by night. 
\v 4 And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait against the city, in the rear of the city; go not very far from the city; and be ye all ready; 
\v 5 And I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto the city; and it shall come to pass that, when they come out against us, as at the first time, we will flee before them; 
\v 6 And they will come out after us, till we have drawn them from the city; for they will say, They flee from us as at the first time: and we will flee before them. 
\v 7 And then shall ye rise up from the ambush, and take possession of the city; and the Lord your God will deliver it in into your hand. 
\v 8 And it shall be, that as soon as ye have seized the city, ye shall set the city on fire; according to the word of the Lord shall ye do: see, I have commanded you. 
\v 9 And Joshua sent them off: and they went to lie in ambush, and remained between Beth-el and 'Ai, on the west side of 'Ai; but Joshua lodged that night among the people. 
\v 10 And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people, toward 'Ai. 
\v 11 And all the people of war that were with him went up, and drew nigh, and came opposite the city, and encamped on the north side of 'Ai; and the valley was between them and 'Ai. 
\v 12 And he took about five thousand men, and set them as an ambush between Beth-el and 'Ai, on the west side of 'Ai. 
\v 13 And the people, all the camp that was on the north of the city, and its ambush on the west of the city got ready; and Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley. 
\v 14 And it came to pass, when the king of 'Ai saw this, the men of the city hastened and rose up early, and went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at the time appointed, before the plain; but he knew not that there was an ambush against him in the rear of the city. 
\v 15 And Joshua and Israel feigned themselves beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness. 
\v 16 And all the people that were in 'Ai were called together to pursue after them; and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city. 
\v 17 And there was not a man left in 'Ai or Beth-el, that went not out after Israel; and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel. 
\v 18 And the Lord said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is in thy hand toward 'Ai; for into thy hand will I give it. And Joshua stretched out the spear which was in his hand toward the city. 
\v 19 And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he stretched out his hand; and they entered into the city, and took possession of it, and hastened and set the city on fire. 
\v 20 And the men of 'Ai turned [and looked] behind them, and they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven; and they had no power to flee this way or that way; and the people that had fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers. 
\v 21 For when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had seized the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended: they turned back, and smote the men of 'Ai. 
\v 22 And the others issued out of the city against them; so that the Israelites had them in the middle, some on this side, and some on that side; and they smote them, until there was not left of them one that remained or escaped. 
\v 23 And the king of 'Ai they caught alive, and brought him to Joshua. 
\v 24 And it came to pass, that, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of 'Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they had pursued them, and when they were all fallen by the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, All the Israelites returned unto 'Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword. 
\v 25 And [the number of] all that fell in that day, both of men and women, was twelve thousand, all the people of 'Ai. 
\v 26 And Joshua drew not back his hand, wherewith he had stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of 'Ai. 
\v 27 Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took as booty unto themselves, according to the word of the Lord which he had commanded Joshua. 
\v 28 And Joshua burnt 'Ai, and made it a ruinous heap of desolation for ever, even unto this day, 
\v 29 And the king of 'Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide; and at the going down of the sun, Joshua commanded, and they took his carcass down from the tree and cast it at the entrance of the city gate, and they raised over him a great heap of stones, [which is] even unto this day. 
\v 30 Then did Joshua build an altar unto the Lord, the God of Israel on mount 'Ebal, 
\v 31 As Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which no one had lifted up any iron tool; and they offered thereon burnt-offerings unto the Lord, and sacrificed peace-offerings. 
\v 32 And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel. 
\v 33 And all Israel, and their elders, and the officers, and their judges, stood on this side and on that side of the ark, opposite the priests the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord, the stranger no less than the native born: half of them turned toward mount Gerizzim, and the other half of them turned toward mount 'Ebal; as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded, to bless the people of Israel at first. 
\v 34 And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, all, just as it is written in the book of the law. 
\v 35 There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded, which Joshua did not read before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the stranger that walked in the midst of them. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass, when all the kings that were on this side of the Jordan, in the mountain, and in the lowlands, and in all the coast of the great sea opposite Lebanon, the Hittites, and the Emorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, heard this, 
\v 2 That they assembled themselves all together, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord. 
\v 3 And when the inhabitants of Gib'on heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho and unto 'Ai, 
\v 4 They also did work wilily, and went and feigned to be messengers, and took old sacks for their asses, and wine-bottles, old, and rent, and bound up; 
\v 5 And [put] old and patched-up shoes upon their feet, and old garments upon themselves; and all the bread of their provision was dry and mouldy. 
\v 6 And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto him, and to the men of Israel, We are come from a far-off country; and now make ye a covenant with us. 
\v 7 And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell in the midst of us; and how can we make a covenant with you: 
\v 8 And they said unto Joshua, We are thy servants. And Joshua said unto them, Who are ye? and whence come ye! 
\v 9 And they said unto him, From a very far-off country are thy servants come, because of the name of the Lord thy God; for we have heard his fame, and all that he hath done in Egypt; 
\v 10 And all that he hath done to the two kings of the Emorites, that were beyond the Jordan, to Sichon the king of Cheshbon, and to 'Og the king of Bashan, who was at 'Ashtaroth. 
\v 11 Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country said to us, as followeth, Take provisions with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say unto them, Your servants are we: and now make ye with us a covenant. 
\v 12 This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; and now, behold, it is dry, and it is become mouldy: 
\v 13 And these wine-bottles, which we filled, when new,— but behold, they are now become rent; and these our garments and our shoes are become worn out by reason of the very long journey. 
\v 14 And the men took of their provisions, but the decision of the Lord they did not ask. 
\v 15 And Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them, to let them live; and the princes of the congregation swore unto them. 
\v 16 And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard that they were their neighbors, and that they dwelt in the midst of them. 
\v 17 And the children of Israel broke up, and came unto their cities on the third day; and their cities were Gib'on, and Kephirah, and Beeroth, and Kiryath-ye'arim. 
\v 18 And the children of Israel smote them not; because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the Lord, the God of Israel; but all the congregation murmured against the princes. 
\v 19 And all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn unto them by the Lord the God of Israel: and now we cannot touch them. 
\v 20 This will we do to them, and we will let them live, that there be no wrath upon us, on account of the oath which we have sworn unto them. 
\v 21 And the princes said unto them, Let them live: and they became hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation, as the princes had spoken unto them. 
\v 22 And Joshua called for them, and he spoke unto them, saying, Wherefore have ye deceived us, saying, We are very far from you: whereas ye dwell in the midst of us? 
\v 23 And now be ye cursed, and there shall not cease to be of you servants and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God. 
\v 24 And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that the Lord thy God had commanded his servant Moses to give unto you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you; wherefore we were sore afraid for our lives because of you, and we have done this thing. 
\v 25 And now, behold, we are in thy hand; as it seemeth good and right in thy eyes to do unto us, so do. 
\v 26 And he did unto them thus; and he delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, and they slew them not. 
\v 27 And Joshua appointed them on that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the Lord, even unto this day, for the place which he should choose. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1 Now it came to pass, when Adoni-zedek, the king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had captured 'Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; [that] as he had done to Jericho and its king, so had he done to 'Ai and its king; and that the inhabitants of Gib'on had made peace with Israel, and were in the midst of them: 
\v 2 That they were greatly afraid; because Gib'on was a great city, like one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than 'Ai, and all the men thereof were mighty. 
\v 3 Therefore Adoni-zedek the king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham the king of Hebron, and unto Piram the king of Yarmuth, and unto Yaphia', the king of Lachish, and unto Debir the king of 'Eglon, saying, 
\v 4 Come up unto me, and help me, that we may smite Gib'on; for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel. 
\v 5 And the five kings of the Emorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Yarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of 'Eglon, assembled themselves together, and went up, they and all their camps, and encamped before Gib'on, and made war against it. 
\v 6 And the men of Gib'on sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Do not withdraw thy hand from thy servants: come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us; for all the kings of the Emorites that dwell in the mountains are assembled together against us. 
\v 7 And Joshua went up from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor. 
\v 8 And the Lord said unto Joshua, Be not afraid of them; for into thy hand have I delivered them: there shall not stand a man of them before thee. 
\v 9 And Joshua came unto them suddenly; the whole night he went up from Gilgal. 
\v 10 And the Lord brought them in confusion before Israel, and they smote them with a great slaughter at Gib'on, and pursued them by the way of the ascent to Beth-choron, and smote them up to 'Azekah, and up to Makkedah. 
\v 11 And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, while they were in the declivity of Beth-choron, that the Lord cast down upon them great stones from heaven, up to 'Azekah, and they died: there were more who died by means of the hailstones than those whom the children of Israel had slain with the sword. 
\v 12 Then spoke Joshua to the Lord on the day when the Lord delivered up the Emorites before the children of Israel, and he said before the eyes of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gib'on; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ayalon. 
\v 13 And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Yashar? And the sun stood still in the midst of the heavens, and hastened not to go down about a whole day. 
\v 14 And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the Lord hearkened unto the voice of a man; for the Lord fought for Israel. 
\v 15 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal. 
\v 16 But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah. 
\v 17 And it was told to Joshua, saying, The five kings have been found hidden in the cave at Makkedah. 
\v 18 And Joshua said, Roll great stones to the mouth of the cave, and set men over it to guard them; 
\v 19 But you, do ye not stay, pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them: suffer them not to enter into their cities; for the Lord your God hath delivered them into your hand. 
\v 20 And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of smiting them with a very great defeat, till they were all spent, and those that escaped had fled from them and entered into the fortified cities, 
\v 21 That all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: no one pointed against any man of the children of Israel his tongue. 
\v 22 Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out unto me those five kings out of the cave. 
\v 23 And they did so, and brought forth unto him those five kings out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Yarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of 'Eglon. 
\v 24 And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the chiefs of the men of war who had gone with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon their necks. 
\v 25 And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be disheartened, be strong and of good courage; for thus will the Lord do unto all your enemies against whom ye fight. 
\v 26 And Joshua smote them afterward, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees; and they remained hanging upon the trees until the evening. 
\v 27 And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down from the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hidden; and they placed great stones upon the mouth of the cave, [which remain] even until this very day. 
\v 28 And Joshua captured Makkedah on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and its king he devoted, them, and all the souls that were therein; he left none that escaped; and he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done unto the king of Jericho. 
\v 29 Then did Joshua, and all Israel with him, pass from Makkedah unto Libnah; and he fought against Libnah; 
\v 30 And the Lord delivered it also into the hand of Israel, with its king; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein; he left none in it that escaped; and he did unto its king as he had done unto the king of Jericho. 
\v 31 And Joshua, and all Israel with him, passed from Libnah unto Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it; 
\v 32 And the Lord delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel; and he captured it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein: just as he had done to Libnah. 
\v 33 Then came up Horam the king of Gezer to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none that escaped. 
\v 34 And Joshua and all Israel with him passed from Lachish unto 'Eglon; and they encamped against it, and fought against it; 
\v 35 And they captured it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword; and all the souls that were therein he devoted on that day: just as he had done to Lachish. 
\v 36 And Joshua and all Israel with him went up from 'Eglon unto Hebron; and they fought against it; 
\v 37 And they captured it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and its king, and all its cities, and all the souls that were therein; he left none that escaped, just as he had done to 'Eglon; and he devoted it, and all the souls that were therein. 
\v 38 And Joshua and all Israel with him returned to Debir; and fought against it; 
\v 39 And he captured it, and its king, and all its cities; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and devoted all the souls that were therein; he left none that escaped: as he had done to Hebron, so did he to Debir and to its king; and as he had done to Libnah and to its king. 
\v 40 And Joshua smote all the country, the mountain, and the south, and the lowlands, and the declivities, and all their kings; he left none that escaped; and all that breathed he utterly destroyed, as the Lord, the God of Israel had commanded. 
\v 41 And Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea' even unto Gazzah, and all the country of Goshen, even up to Gib'on. 
\v 42 And all these kings and their land did Joshua capture at one time; because the Lord, the God of Israel fought for Israel. 
\v 43 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass, that, when Yabin the king of Chazor heard these things, he sent to Yobab the king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph, 
\v 2 And to the kings that were at the north, on the mountains, and in the plains, south of Kinneroth, and in the lowlands, and in the district of Dor on the west, 
\v 3 To the Canaanites on the east and on the west, and to the Emorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites in the mountains, and to the Hivites under Chermon in the land of Mizpah. 
\v 4 And they went out, they and all their camps with them, much people, even as the sand that is upon the sea-shore in multitude, and with very many horses and chariots. 
\v 5 And all these kings assembled themselves together, and they came and encamped together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel. 
\v 6 And the Lord said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them; for tomorrow about this time will I give all of them up slain before Israel: their horses shalt thou hamstring and their chariots shalt thou burn with fire. 
\v 7 And Joshua and all the people of war with him came upon them by the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them. 
\v 8 And the Lord delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote them, and pursued them unto great Zidon, and unto Missrephoth-mayim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them none that escaped. 
\v 9 And Joshua did unto them as the Lord had said unto him: their horses he hamstringed and their chariots he burnt with fire. 
\v 10 And Joshua at that time turned back, and captured Chazor, and its kings he smote with the sword; for Chazor aforetimes was the head of all these kingdoms. 
\v 11 And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword, and devoted them; there was not left any one having breath; and Chazor he burnt with fire. 
\v 12 And all the cities of these kings, and all their kings, did Joshua capture, and he smote them with the edge of the sword, and he devoted them, as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded. 
\v 13 But as for the cities that had been left standing in their strength, these did Israel not burn: save Chazor only did Joshua burn. 
\v 14 And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, did the children of Israel take as booty unto themselves; but all the men they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them: they left not any one having breath. 
\v 15 As the Lord had commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua, and so did Joshua: he left nothing undone of all that the Lord had commanded Moses. 
\v 16 And Joshua took all that land, the mountain, and all the south country, and all the land of Goshen, and the lowlands, and the plain, and the mountain of Israel, and its lowlands; 
\v 17 From the bald mountain that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Chermon; and all their kings he captured, and smote them, and slew them. 
\v 18 A long time did Joshua make war with all these kings. 
\v 19 There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gib'on: the whole they took by war. 
\v 20 For of the Lord it was to harden their heart, that they should come against Israel in battle, in order to destroy them utterly, that they might obtain no favor: but in order that he might exterminate them, as the Lord had commanded Moses. 
\v 21 And Joshua came at that time, and cut off the 'Anakim from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from 'Anab, and from the whole mountain of Judah, and from the whole mountain of Israel: with their cities did Joshua destroy them utterly. 
\v 22 There was none of the 'Anakim left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gazzah, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained some. 
\v 23 And Joshua' took the whole land, all just as the Lord had spoken unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel, according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 And these are the kings of the land whom the children of Israel smote, and whose land they took possession of on the other side of the Jordan, toward the rising of the sun, from the river Arnon unto mount Chermon, and all the plain on the east: 
\v 2 Sichon the king of the Emorites, who dwelt in Cheshbon, and ruled from 'Aro'er, which is upon the bank of the brook Arnon, and over the land in the middle of the brook, and from half Gil'ad, even unto the brook Yabbok, the boundary of the children of 'Ammon; 
\v 3 And over the plain up to the sea of Kinneroth on the east, and up to the sea of the plain, the salt sea on the east, on the way to Beth-hayeshimoth; and at the south, under the declivities of Pisgah; 
\v 4 And the territory of 'Og the king of Bashan, who was of the remnant of the Rephaim, that dwelt at 'Ashtaroth and at Edre'i, 
\v 5 And reigned over mount Chermon, and over Salchah, and over all Bashan, unto the border of the Geshurites and the Ma'achathites, and half Gil'ad, [to] the boundary of Sichon the king of Cheshbon. 
\v 6 These did Moses the servant of the Lord and the children of Israel smite; and Moses the servant of the Lord gave it for a possession unto the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Menasseh. 
\v 7 And these are the kings of the country whom Joshua and the children of Israel smote on this side of the Jordan on the west, from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon as far as the bald mountain, that goeth up to Seir; and Joshua gave it unto the tribes of Israel for a possession, according to their divisions; 
\v 8 In the mountains, and in the lowlands, and in the plain, and in the declivities, and in the wilderness, and in the south country: the Hittites, the Emorites, and the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. 
\v 9 The king of Jericho, one; the king of 'Ai, which was beside Bethel one; 
\v 10 The king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one; 
\v 11 The king of Yarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one; 
\v 12 The king of 'Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one; 
\v 13 The king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one; 
\v 14 The king of Chormah, one; the king of 'Arad, one; 
\v 15 The king of Libnah, one; the king of 'Adullam, one; 
\v 16 The king of Makkedah, one; the king of Beth'el, one; 
\v 17 The king of Tappuach, one; the king of Chepher, one; 
\v 18 The king of Aphek, one; the king of Lasharon, one; 
\v 19 The king of Madon, one; the king of Chazor, one; 
\v 20 The king of Shimron-meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one; 
\v 21 The king of Ta'anach, one; the king of Megiddo, one; 
\v 22 The king of Kedesh, one; the king of Yokne'am on Carmel, one; 
\v 23 The king of Dor in the district of Dor, one; the king of Goyim in Gilgal, one; 
\v 24 The king of Tirzah, one: in all thirty and one kings. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 Now Joshua was old, well stricken in years; and the Lord said unto him, Thou art old, stricken in years, and of the land there remaineth yet very much to be taken possession of. 
\v 2 This is the land that yet remaineth: All the circles of the Philistines, and all [the land of the] Geshurites, 
\v 3 From the Shichor, which runneth before Egypt, even unto the boundary of 'Ekron northward, is counted to the Canaanites; the five lords of the Philistines; the Gazzathites, and the Ashdodites, the Eshkelonites, the Gittites, and the 'Ekronites; also the 'Avvim; 
\v 4 On the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Me'arah that belongeth to the Zidonians, up to Aphek, up to the border of the Emorites; 
\v 5 And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward the rising of the sun, from Ba'al-gad under mount Chermon up to the entrance of Chamath. 
\v 6 All the inhabitants of the mountain from Lebanon unto Missrephoth-mayim, all the Zidonians: these will I drive out from before the children of Israel; only divide thou it by lot unto the Israelites for an inheritance, as I have commanded thee. 
\v 7 And now divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes, and the half tribe of Menasseh. 
\v 8 With him the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance, which Moses gave unto them, beyond the Jordan eastward, as Moses the servant of the Lord hath given them; 
\v 9 From 'Aro'er, that is upon the bank of the brook Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the brook, and all the plain of Medeba up to Dibon; 
\v 10 And all the cities of Sichon the king of the Emorites, who reigned over Cheshbon, up to the border of the children of 'Ammon; 
\v 11 And Gil'ad, and the territory of the Geshurites and Ma'achathites, and all mount Chermon, and all Bashan up to Salchah; 
\v 12 All the kingdom of 'Og in Bashan, who reigned in 'Ashtaroth and in Edre'i; who had been left of the remnant of the Rephaim; and Moses smote them, and cast them out. 
\v 13 Nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites and the Ma'achathites; but the Geshurites and the Ma'achathites continued to dwell in the midst of the Israelites until this day. 
\v 14 Only unto the tribe of Levi he gave no inheritance: the fire-offerings of the Lord, the God of Israel, are their inheritance, as he hath spoken unto them. 
\v 15 And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben according to their families; 
\v 16 And their territory was from 'Aro'er, that is on the bank of the brook Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the brook, and all the plain by Medeba; 
\v 17 Cheshbon, and all its cities that are in the plain; Dibon, and Bamoth-ba'al, and Beth-ba'al-me'on, 
\v 18 And Yahzah, and Kedemoth, and Mepha'ath, 
\v 19 And Kiryathayim, and Sibmah, and Zereth-hashachar on the mount of the valley, 
\v 20 And Beth-pe'or, and the declivities of Pisgah, and Beth-hayeshimoth, 
\v 21 And all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sichon the king of the Emorites, who reigned in Cheshbon, whom Moses smote with the princes of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Chur, and Reba', the dukes of Sichon, the dwellers of the country. 
\v 22 And Bil'am the son of Be'or, the soothsayer, did the children of Israel slay with the sword among their slain. 
\v 23 And the boundary of the children of Reuben was the Jordan, and its bordering territory. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben after their families, the cities and their villages. 
\v 24 And Moses gave unto the tribe of Gad, unto the children of Gad according to their families; 
\v 25 And their territory was Ya'zer, and all the cities of Gil'ad, and half the land of the children of 'Ammon, up to 'Aro'er that is before Rabbah; 
\v 26 And from Cheshbon unto Ramath-mizpeh, and Betonim; and from Machanayim up to the border of Debir; 
\v 27 And in the valley, Beth-haram, and Beth-nimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sichon the king of Cheshbon, the Jordan and its bordering territory, up to the edge of the sea of Kinnereth on the other side of the Jordan eastward. 
\v 28 This is the inheritance of the children of Gad after their families, the cities and their villages. 
\v 29 And Moses gave unto the half tribe of Menasseh; and it belonged to the half tribe of the children of Menasseh after their families; 
\v 30 And their territory was from Machanayim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of 'Og the king of Bashan, and all the villages of Ya'ir, which are in Bashan, sixty cities; 
\v 31 And half Gil'ad and 'Ashtaroth, and Edre'i, the cities of the kingdom of 'Og in Bashan, [belonged] unto the children of Machir the son of Menasseh, even to the one half of the children of Machir after their families. 
\v 32 These are they to whom Moses did distribute an inheritance in the plans of Moab, on the other side of the Jordan, by Jericho, eastward. 
\v 33 But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not any inheritance: the Lord the God of Israel is himself their inheritance, as he hath spoken unto them. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1 And these are the countries which the children of Israel obtained as an inheritance in the land of Canaan, which Elazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the divisions of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for an inheritance unto them, 
\v 2 By the lot as their inheritance: as the Lord had commanded by the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes, and the half tribe. 
\v 3 For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half tribe on the other side of the Jordan; but unto the Levites he had given no inheritance among them. 
\v 4 For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Menasseh and Ephraim; therefore they gave no portion unto the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell in, with their open spaces for their cattle and for their substance. 
\v 5 As the Lord had commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel, and so divided they the land. 
\v 6 And the children of Judah came near unto Joshua in Gilgal; and Caleb the son of Yephunneh the Kenizzite said unto him, Thou well knowest the word which the Lord spoke unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thyself in Kadesh-barnea'. 
\v 7 Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh-barnea' to spy out the land; and I brought him word again as it was in my heart. 
\v 8 But my brethren who had gone up with me caused the heart of the people to be faint; but I wholly followed the Lord my God. 
\v 9 And Moses swore on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy foot hath trodden shall belong to thee for an inheritance, and to thy children for ever; because thou hast wholly followed the Lord my God. 
\v 10 And now, behold, the Lord hath kept me alive, as he hath spoken: it is now forty and five years since the Lord spoke this word unto Moses, while Israel wandered in the wilderness; and now, behold, I am this day eighty and five years old. 
\v 11 I am yet this day as strong as I was on the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, and to go out, and to come in. 
\v 12 Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the Lord spoke on that day; for thou didst hear on that day that the 'Anakim were there, and great fortified cities: perhaps the Lord will be with me, and I shall drive them out, as the Lord hath spoken. 
\v 13 And Joshua blessed him, and gave Hebron unto Caleb the son of Yephunneh for an inheritance. 
\v 14 Therefore did Hebron become the inheritance of Caleb the son of Yephunneh the Kenizzite unto this day; for the cause that he had wholly followed the Lord the God of Israel. 
\v 15 And the name of Hebron was aforetimes Kiryatharba', who was the greatest man among the 'Anakim. And the land had rest from war. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1 And the lot for the tribe of the children of Judah after their families came by the border of Edom, with the wilderness of Zin, southward, as the uttermost southern boundary. 
\v 2 And their southern boundary was from the end of the salt sea, from the bay that bendeth southward: 
\v 3 And it went out to the south of the heights of 'Akrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and ascended up on the south side unto Kadesh-barnea, and passed along to Chezron, and went up to Adar, and fetched a compass to Karka'; 
\v 4 And it passed on toward 'Azmon, and went out unto the river of Egypt; and the terminations of the boundary were at the sea: this shall be your southern boundary. 
\v 5 And the east boundary was the salt sea, unto the end of the Jordan. And the boundary in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the end of the Jordan; 
\v 6 And the boundary went up to Beth-choglah, and passed along by the north of Beth'arabah; and the boundary went up to Ebenbohan the son of Reuben; 
\v 7 And the boundary went up toward Debir from the Valley of 'Achor, and at the north it bent toward Gilgal, that is opposite the heights of Adummim, which is on the south side of the valley; and the boundary passed toward the waters of 'En-shemesh, and its terminations were at En-rogel; 
\v 8 And the boundary went up to the valley of the son of Hinnom unto the south side of the Jebusite, the same is Jerusalem; and the boundary went up to the top of the mount that lieth before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the valley of Rephaim northward; 
\v 9 And the boundary extended from the top of the mount unto the spring of the waters of Nephtoach, and went out to the cities of mount 'Ephron; and the boundary extended to Ba'alah, which is Kiryath-ye'arim; 
\v 10 And the boundary compassed from Ba'alah westward unto mount Seir, and passed along unto the side of mount Ye'arim, which is Kessalon, on the north side, and went down to Beth-shemesh, and passed on to Timnah; 
\v 11 And the boundary went out unto the side of 'Ekron northward; and the boundary extended to Shikron, and passed along to the mount of Ba'alah, and went out unto Yabneel; and the terminations of the boundary were at the sea. 
\v 12 And the west boundary was by the great sea, and the coast thereof. This is the boundary of the children of Judah round about according to their families. 
\v 13 And unto Caleb the son of Yephunneh he gave as a portion among the children of Judah, according to the order of the Lord to Joshua, Kiryath-arba' the father of 'Anak, which is Hebron. 
\v 14 And Caleb drove out from there the three sons of 'Anak, Sheshai, and Achiman, and Talmai, the children of 'Anak. 
\v 15 And he went up from there to the inhabitants of Debir; and the name of Debir before was Kiryath-sepher. 
\v 16 And Caleb said, He that will smite Kiryath-sepher, and capture it, to him will I give 'Achsah my daughter for wife. 
\v 17 And 'Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, captured it; and he gave him 'Achsah his daughter for wife. 
\v 18 And it came to pass, as she came thither, that she persuaded him to ask of her father a field: and she alighted from her ass; and Caleb said unto her, What aileth thee? 
\v 19 And she said, Give me a blessing; for a dry land hast thou given me: give me then also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs. 
\v 20 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families. 
\v 21 And the cities of the boundary line of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the border of Edom, on the south, were Kabzeel, and 'Eder, and Yagur, 
\v 22 And Kinah, and Dimonah, and 'Ad'adah, 
\v 23 And Kedesh, and Chazor, and Yithnan, 
\v 24 Ziph, and Telem, and Be'aloth, 
\v 25 And Chazor-chadattah, and Keriyoth-chezron, which is Chazor, 
\v 26 Amam, and Shema', and Moladah, 
\v 27 And Chazar-gaddah, and Cheshmon, and Beth-palet, 
\v 28 And Chazar-shual, and Beer-sheba, and Bizyotheyah, 
\v 29 Ba'alah, and 'Iyim, and 'Azem, 
\v 30 And Eltolad, and Kessil, and Chormah, 
\v 31 And Ziklag, and Madmannah, and Sansannah, 
\v 32 And Lebaoth, and Shilchim, and 'Ayin, and Rimmon: in all twenty and nine cities, with their villages. 
\v 33 And in the lowlands, Eshtaol, and Zor'ah, and Ashnah. 
\v 34 And Zanoach, and 'En-gannim, Tappuach, and 'Enam, 
\v 35 Yarmuth, and 'Adullam, Sochoh, and 'Azekah, 
\v 36 And Sha'arayim, and 'Adithayim, and Gederah, and Gede-rothayim: fourteen cities with their villages. 
\v 37 Zenan, and Chadashah, and Migdalgad, 
\v 38 And Dil'an, and Mizpeh, and Yoktheel, 
\v 39 Lachish, and Bozkath, and 'Eglon, 
\v 40 And Cabbon, and Lachmass, and Kithlish, 
\v 41 And Gederoth, Beth-dagon, and Na'amah, and Makkedah: sixteen cities with their villages. 
\v 42 Libnah, and 'Ether, and 'Ashan, 
\v 43 And Yiphtach, and Ashnah, and Nezib, 
\v 44 And Ke'ilah, and Achzib, and Mareshah: nine cities with their villages. 
\v 45 'Ekron, with its towns and its villages: 
\v 46 From 'Ekron even unto the sea, all that lay alongside of Ashdod, with their villages. 
\v 47 Ashdod with its towns and its villages, Gazzah, with its towns and its villages, up to the brook of Egypt, and the great sea, and its territory. 
\v 48 And in the mountains, Shamir, and Yattir, and Sochoh, 
\v 49 And Dannah and Kiryath-sannah, which is Debir, 
\v 50 And 'Anab, and Eshtemoh, and 'Anim. 
\v 51 And Goshen, and Cholon, and Giloh: eleven cities with their villages. 
\v 52 Arab, and Dumah, and Esh'an, 
\v 53 And Vanum, and Beth-tappuach, and Aphekah, 
\v 54 And Chumtah, and Kiryath-arba', which is Hebron, and Zi'or: nine cities with their villages. 
\v 55 Ma'on, Carmel, and Ziph, and Yutah, 
\v 56 And Yizre'el, and Yokde'am, and Zanoach, 
\v 57 Kayin, Gib'ah, and Timnah: ten cities with their villages. 
\v 58 Chatchul, Beth-zur, and Gedor, 
\v 59 And Ma'arath, and Beth-'anoth, and Eltekon: six cities with their village. 
\v 60 Kiryath-baal, which is Kiryath-ye'arim, and Rabbah; two cities with their villages. 
\v 61 In the wilderness, Beth-ha'arabah, Middin, and Sechachah, 
\v 62 And Nibshan, and 'Ir-hammelach, and 'En-gedi: six cities with their villages. 
\v 63 As for the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem, these the children of Judah could not drive out; but the Jebusites dwelt with the children of Judah at Jerusalem, even unto this day. 
\c 16  
\p
\v 1 And the lot of the children of Joseph fell from the Jordan by Jericho, unto the waters of Jericho on the east, to the wilderness that goeth up from Jericho by the mount Beth-el, 
\v 2 And [the boundary] went out from Beth-el to Luz, and passed along unto the boundary of the Arkites to 'Ataroth, 
\v 3 And went down westward to the boundary of the Yaphleti, unto the border of Beth-choron the lower, and to Gezer; and its terminations were toward the sea. 
\v 4 This did the children of Joseph, Menasseh and Ephraim, take as their inheritance. 
\v 5 And [this] was the boundary of the children of Ephraim according to their families; and the boundary of their inheritance on the east side was 'Atroth-addar, up to Beth-choron the upper; 
\v 6 And the boundary went out toward the sea to Michmethath on the north; and the boundary fetched a compass eastward unto Taanathshiloh, and passed by it on the east to Yanochah; 
\v 7 And it went down from Yanochah to 'Ataroth, and to Na'arath, and touched on Jericho, and went out at the Jordan. 
\v 8 From Tappuach westward the border went out unto the brook Kanah; and its terminations were toward the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim after their families; 
\v 9 And [in addition to this] the cities which were separated for the children of Ephraim in the midst of the inheritance of the children of Menasseh, all the cities with their villages. 
\v 10 And they drove not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt among the Ephraimites until this day, and became tributary servants. 
\c 17  
\p
\v 1 And then came the lot for the tribe of Menasseh; for he was the first-born of Joseph: to wit, for Machir the first-born of Menasseh, the father of Gil'ad; because he was a man of war, therefore he obtained Gil'ad and Bashan. 
\v 2 There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Menasseh after their families; for the children of Abi'ezer, and for the children of Chelek, and for the children of Assriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Chepher, and for the children of Shemida': these were the male children of Menasseh the son of Joseph after their families. 
\v 3 But Zelophchad, the son of Chepher, the son of Gil'ad, the son of Machir, the son of Menasseh, had no sons, but only daughters, and these are the names of his daughters, Machlah, and No'ah, Choglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. 
\v 4 And they came near before Elazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, The Lord commanded Moses to give unto us an inheritance among our brethren. And he gave them, according to the order of the Lord, an inheritance among the brethren of their father. 
\v 5 And there fell ten portions of Menasseh, beside the lands of Gil'ad and Bashan, which were on the other side of the Jordan; 
\v 6 Because the daughters of Menasseh obtained an inheritance among his sons: and the land of Gil'ad belonged to the rest of the sons of Manasseh. 
\v 7 And the boundary of Menasseh was from Asher to Michmethath, that lieth before Shechem; and the boundary went along on the right hand unto the inhabitants of 'En-tappuach. 
\v 8 To Menasseh belonged the land of Tappuach; but Tappuach on the borders of Menasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim; 
\v 9 And the boundary descended unto the brook Kanah, southward of the brook; these cities belonging to Ephraim are in the midst of the cities of Menasseh; and the boundary of Menasseh was on the north side of the river, and its terminations were toward the sea: 
\v 10 Southward it was Ephraim's, and northward it was Menasseh's, and the sea was [there] his boundary; and on Asher they touched on the north, and on Issachar on the east. 
\v 11 And to Menasseh belonged in Issachar and in Asher Beth-shean and its towns, and Yible'am and its towns, together with the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of 'En-dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Ta'anach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns, namely the three districts. 
\v 12 Yet the children of Menasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of these cities; but the Canaanites succeeded to dwell in this land; 
\v 13 Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were become strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute; but they did not drive them out. 
\v 14 And the children of Joseph spoke unto Joshua, saying, Why hast thou given me but one lot and one portion as an inheritance, seeing I am a numerous people, to which extent the Lord hath hitherto blessed me? 
\v 15 And Joshua said unto them, If thou art a numerous people, then get thee up to the wood country, and cut down [a space] for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim, if the mountain of Ephraim be too narrow for thee. 
\v 16 And the children of Joseph said, The mountain will not be enough for us; and chariots of iron are belonging to all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley, to those who are at Beth-shean and its towns, and to those who are in the valley of Yizre'el. 
\v 17 And Joshua said unto the house of Joseph, to Ephraim and to Menasseh, as followeth, Thou art a numerous people, and hast great power; thou shalt not have one lot only; 
\v 18 But the mountain shall be thine; it is indeed a wood, yet thou canst cut it down; and the terminations of it shall be thine; for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots, though they be strong. 
\c 18  
\p
\v 1 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh, and set up there the tabernacle of the congregation. And the land was subdued before them. 
\v 2 And there remained among the children of Israel, that had not yet received their inheritance, seven tribes. 
\v 3 And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long will ye show yourselves slack to go to take possession of the land, which the Lord the God of your fathers hath given to you! 
\v 4 Furnish for yourselves three men for each tribe; and I will send them out, and they shall arise, and walk through the land, and describe it according to their inheritance, and come again to me. 
\v 5 And they shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall remain on his boundary at the south, and the house of Joseph shall remain on their boundary at the north. 
\v 6 But you shall make a description of the land in seven parts, and bring it hither to me; and I will cast the lot for you here, before the Lord our God. 
\v 7 For to the Levites there is no portion among you; for the priesthood of the Lord is their inheritance; and Gad, and Reuben, and half the tribe of Menasseh have already received their inheritance beyond the Jordan, at the east, which Moses the servant of the Lord gave to them. 
\v 8 And the men arose, and went away; and Joshua charged those that went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land, and describe it, and return again to me; and here will I cast the lot for you before the Lord, in Shiloh. 
\v 9 And the men went and passed through the land, and described it according to the cities in seven parts in a book; and they came again to Joshua to the camp at Shiloh. 
\v 10 And Joshua cast the lot for them in Shiloh before the Lord; and Joshua divided there the land unto the children of Israel according to their divisions. 
\v 11 And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families; and the boundary of their lot came forth between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph. 
\v 12 And their boundary was on the north side [starting] from the Jordan; and the boundary went up to the side of Jericho on the north, and went up through the mountains westward; and its terminations were at the wilderness of Beth-aven. 
\v 13 And the boundary went over from there toward Luz, to the south side of Luz, which is Beth-el; and the boundary descended to 'Atroth-addar, upon the mount that is on the south side of the lower Beth-choron. 
\v 14 And the border extended [thence], and fetched a compass to the west side, to the south of the mount that is before Beth-choron at the south; and its terminations were at Kiryath-ba'al, which is Kiryath-ye'arim, a city of the children of Judah: this was the west side. 
\v 15 And the south side commenced from the end of Kiryath-ye'arim, and the boundary went out on the west, and went out to the spring of the waters of Nephtoach: 
\v 16 And the boundary went down to the end of the mountain that is before the valley of the son of Hinnom, and which is in the valley of Rephaim at the north, and descended to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of the Jebusi on the south, and descended to 'Enrogel, 
\v 17 And extended northwardly, and went forth to 'En-shemesh, and went forth toward Geliloth, which is opposite to the ascent of Adummim, and descended to Eben-bohan the son of Reuben, 
\v 18 And passed along on this side opposite to 'Arabah northward; and went down unto 'Arabah; 
\v 19 And the boundary passed along to the side of Beth-choglah northward; and the terminations of the border were at the north bay of the Salt Sea at the south end of the Jordan: this was the south boundary. 
\v 20 And the Jordan bounded it on the east side. This was the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by its boundaries round about, according to their families. 
\v 21 Now these were the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families, Jericho, and Beth-choglah, and 'Emekkeziz, 
\v 22 And Beth-ha'arabah, and Zemarayim, and Beth-el, 
\v 23 And Avvim, and Parah, and 'Ophrah, 
\v 24 And Kephar-ha'ammonah, and 'Ophni, and Geba': twelve cities with their villages. 
\v 25 Gib'on, and Ramah, and Beeroth, 
\v 26 And Mizpeh, and Kephirah, and Mozah, 
\v 27 And Rekem, and Yirpeel, and Taralah, 
\v 28 And Zela', Eleph, and Jebusi, which is Jerusalem, Gib'ath, and Kiryath: fourteen cities with their villages. This is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their families. 
\c 19  
\p
\v 1 And then came forth the second lot for Simeon, for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families; and their inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of Judah. 
\v 2 And they obtained in their inheritance Beer-sheba', [or] Sheba', and Moladah, 
\v 3 And Chazar-shu'al, and Balah, and 'Ezem, 
\v 4 And Eltolad, and Bethul, and Chormah, 
\v 5 And Ziklag, and Beth-hamarcaboth, and Chazar-sussah, 
\v 6 And Beth-lebaoth, and Sharuchen: thirteen cities and their villages. 
\v 7 'Ayin, Rimmon, and 'Ether, and 'Ashan; four cities and their villages. 
\v 8 And all the villages that were round about these cities up to Ba'alath-beer, South Ramah. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families. 
\v 9 Out of the portion of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon; for the portion of the children of Judah was too much for them; therefore the children of Simeon obtained their inheritance within their inheritance. 
\v 10 And then came up the third lot for the children of Zebulun according to their families; and the boundary of their inheritance extended up to Sarid; 
\v 11 And their boundary went up toward the sea, and Mar'alah, and touched on Dabbesheth, and touched on the brook that is before Yokne'am; 
\v 12 And turned from Sarid eastward toward the rising of the sun unto the border of Kisloth-tabor, and then went out to Daberath, and went up to Yaphia'; 
\v 13 And from there it passed on in front to the east unto Gath-Chepher, to 'Eth-kazin, and went out to Rimmon, whence it extended to Ne'ah; 
\v 14 And this boundary turned about on the north side to Channathon; and its terminations were in the valley of Yiph-thach-el; 
\v 15 And Kattath, and Nahallal, and Shimron, and Yidalah, and Beth-lechem: twelve cities with their villages. 
\v 16 This is the inheritance of the children of Zebulun according to their families, these cities with their villages. 
\v 17 For Issachar came out the fourth lot, for the children of Issachar according to their families. 
\v 18 And their boundary went to Yizre'el, and Kessulloth, and Shunem, 
\v 19 And Chapharayim, and Shion, and Anacharath, 
\v 20 And Rabbith, and Kishyon, and Abez, 
\v 21 And Remeth, and 'En-gannim, and 'En-chaddah, and Beth-pazazz; 
\v 22 And the boundary touched on Tabor, and Shachazimah, and Beth-shemesh; and the terminations of their boundaries were at the Jordan: sixteen cities with their villages. 
\v 23 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Issachar according to their families, the cities and their villages. 
\v 24 And then came out the fifth lot for the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families. 
\v 25 And their boundary was Chelkath, and Chali, and Beten, and Achshaph, 
\v 26 And Allammelech, and 'Am'ad, and Mishal; and it touched on Carmel at the sea, and on Shichor-libnath; 
\v 27 And it turned toward the rising of the sun to Beth-dagon, and touched on Zebulun, and on the valley of Yiphthach-el at the north, on Beth-ha'emek, and Ne'iel, and went out to Cabul on the left, 
\v 28 And 'Ebron, and Rechob, and Chammon, and Kanah, up to Zidon the great city, 
\v 29 And then the boundary turned back to Ramah, and to the city of Mibzar-zor; and then the boundary turned back to Chossah; and the terminations were by the sea in the district toward Achzib; 
\v 30 And 'Ummah and Aphek, and Rechob: twenty and two cities with their villages. 
\v 31 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families, these cities with their villages. 
\v 32 Unto the children of Naphtali came out the sixth lot, for the children of Naphtali according to their families. 
\v 33 And their boundary was from Cheleph, from Allon-beza-'anannim, and Adami-hanekeb, and Yabneel, as far as Lakkum; and its terminations were at the Jordan; 
\v 34 And then the boundary turned westward to Aznoth-tabor, and went out from there to Chukkok, and touched on Zebulun on the south, and touched on Asher on the west, and on Judah upon the Jordan toward the rising of the sun. 
\v 35 And fortified cities, Ziddim, Zer, and Chammath, Rakkath, and Kinnereth, 
\v 36 And Adamah, and Ramah, and Chazor, 
\v 37 And Kedesh, and Edre'i, and 'En-chazor, 
\v 38 And Yiron, and Migdal-el, Chorem, and Beth-'anath, and Beth-shemesh: nineteen cities with their villages. 
\v 39 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali according to their families, the cities and their villages. 
\v 40 For the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families came out of the seventh lot. 
\v 41 And the boundary of their inheritance was Zor'ah, and Eshtaol, and 'Ir-shemesh, 
\v 42 And Sha'alabbin, and Ayalon, and Yithlah, 
\v 43 And Elon, and Thimnathah, and 'Ekron, 
\v 44 And Eltekeh, and Gibbethon, and Ba'alath, 
\v 45 And Yehud, and Bene-berak, and Gathrimmon. 
\v 46 And Me-hayarkon, and Rakkon, with the boundary before Yapho. 
\v 47 And the territory of the children of Dan went out beyond these; for the children of Dan went up and fought against Leshem, and captured it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and took possession of it, and dwelt therein, and they called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father. 
\v 48 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages. 
\v 49 And they made an end of dividing the land for inheritance after its boundaries; and the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun among them; 
\v 50 By the order of the Lord did they give him the city which he had asked, Timnathserach on the mountain of Ephraim: and he built the city, and dwelt therein. 
\v 51 These are the inheritances, which Elazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the divisions of the tribes of the children of Israel, divided for an inheritance by lot, at Shiloh before the Lord, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. So they made an end of dividing the country. 
\c 20  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spoke unto Joshua, saying, 
\v 2 speak to the children of Israel, saying, Appoint for yourselves the cities of refuge, whereof I have spoken unto you by the hand of Moses; 
\v 3 That thither may flee the manslayer that killeth any person unawares, without knowledge; and they shall be unto you for a refuge from the avenger of the blood. 
\v 4 And he shall flee unto one of those cities, and he shall stand at the entrance of the gate of the city, and speak in the ears of the elders of that city his words; and they shall take him into the city unto them, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them. 
\v 5 And if the avenger of the blood should pursue after him, then shall they not deliver the manslayer up into his hand; because without knowledge did he smite his neighbor, and he was not an enemy to him in time past. 
\v 6 And he shall dwell in that city, until he shall have stood before the congregation for judgment, [and] until the death of the high-priest that may be in those days: then shall the manslayer return, and come unto his own house, unto the city whence he hath fled. 
\v 7 And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in the mountain of Naphtali, and Shechem in the mountain of Ephraim, and Kiryath-arba', which is Hebron, in the mountain of Judah. 
\v 8 And on the other side of the Jordan by Jericho eastward, they appointed Bezer in the wilderness in the plain from the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gil'ad from the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan from the tribe of Menasseh. 
\v 9 These were the cities assigned for all the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them, that thither might flee whosoever killeth any person at unawares, and that he should not die by the hand of the avenger of the blood, until he have stood before the congregation. 
\c 21  
\p
\v 1 Then came near the heads of the divisions of the Levites unto Elazar the priest, and unto Joshua the son of Nun, and unto the heads of the divisions of the tribes of the children of Israel; 
\v 2 And they spoke unto them at Shiloh, in the land of Canaan, saying, The Lord commanded by the hand of Moses to give unto us cities to dwell in, with the open spaces thereof for our cattle. 
\v 3 And the children of Israel gave unto the Levites from their inheritance, at the order of the Lord, these cities and their open spaces. 
\v 4 And the lot came out for the families of the Kehathites: and the children of Aaron the priest, who were of the Levites, obtained from the tribe of Judah, and from the tribe of Simeon, and from the tribe of Benjamin, by lot, thirteen cities. 
\v 5 And the rest of the children of Kehath obtained from the families of the tribe of Ephraim, and from the tribe of Dan, and from the half tribe of Menasseh, by lot, ten cities.

\v 9 And they gave from the tribe of the children of Judah, and from the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which are called by name. 
\v 10 And the children of Aaron, of the families of the Kehathites, of the children of Levi, obtained them;—for they had the first lot. 
\v 11 And they gave unto them Kiryath-arba', [the father of 'Anak,] which is Hebron, in the mountain of Judah, with the open spaces thereof round about it; 
\v 12 But the fields of the city, and its villages, they gave to Caleb the son of Yephunneh for his possession. 
\v 13 And to the children of Aaron the priest they gave the city of refuge for the manslayer, Hebron with its open spaces, and Libnah with its open spaces, 
\v 14 And Yattir with its open spaces, and Eshtemoa' with its open spaces. 
\v 15 And Cholon with its open spaces, and Debir with its open spaces, 
\v 16 And 'Ayin with its open spaces, and Yuttah with its open spaces, and Beth-shemesh with its open spaces: nine cities from those two tribes. 
\v 17 And from the tribe of Benjamin, Gib'on with its open spaces, Geba' with its open spaces, 
\v 18 'Anathoth with its open spaces, and 'Almon with its open spaces: four cities. 
\v 19 All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, were thirteen cities with their open spaces. 
\v 20 And the families of the children of Kehath, the Levites, who remained of the children of Kehath, obtained the cities of their lot from the tribe of Ephraim. 
\v 21 And they gave to them the city of refuge for the manslayer, Shechem with its open spaces in the mountain of Ephraim, and Gezer with its open spaces, 
\v 22 And Kibzayim with its open spaces, and Beth-choron with its open spaces: four cities.

\v 24 Ayalon with its open spaces, Gath-rimmon with its open spaces: four cities. 
\v 25 And from the half tribe of Menasseh, Ta'nach with its open spaces, and Gath-rimmon with its open spaces: two cities. 
\v 26 All the cities were ten with their open spaces for the families of the children of Kehath that remained. 
\v 27 And unto the children of Gershon, of the families of the Levites, [they gave] from the other half tribe of Menasseh the city of refuge for the manslayer, Golan in Bashan with its open spaces, and Be'eshterah with its open spaces: two cities.

\v 40 (21:38) All the cities for the children of Merari after their families, they who were remaining of the families of the Levites, even their lot was twelve cities. 
\v 41 (21:39) All the cities of the Levites in the midst of the possession of the children of Israel were forty and eight cities with their open spaces. 
\v 42 (21:40) These cities were every one with their open spaces round about them: thus it was with all these cities. 
\v 43 (21:41) And the Lord gave unto Israel all the land which he had sworn to give unto their fathers; and they possessed it, and dwelt therein. 
\v 44 (21:42) And the Lord gave them rest round about, all just as he had sworn unto their fathers: and there stood not up before them a man of all their enemies; all their enemies the Lord delivered into their hand. 
\v 45 (21:43) There failed not aught of all the good thing which the Lord had spoken unto the house of Israel: it all came to pass.

\v 1 Then did Joshua call the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Menasseh, 
\v 2 And he said unto them, Ye have indeed kept all that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you, and ye have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you: 
\v 3 Ye have not forsaken your brethren these many days, until this day; but ye have kept the obligation of the commandment of the Lord your God. 
\v 4 And now the Lord your God hath given rest unto your brethren, as he promised them; therefore now turn yourselves, and get you unto your tents, unto the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of the Lord gave unto you on the other side of the Jordan. 
\v 5 Only take diligent heed to practise the commandment and the law, which Moses the servant of the Lord hath commanded you, to love the Lord your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to cleave unto him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul. 
\v 6 And Joshua blessed them, and sent them away; and they went unto their tents. 
\v 7 Now to the one half of the tribe of Menasseh Moses had given possession in Bashan; but unto the other half thereof gave Joshua with their brethren on this side of the Jordan westward; and when Joshua sent them also away unto their tents, he blessed them; 
\v 8 And he said unto them, as followeth, With much riches return unto your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with copper, and with iron, and with very many garments: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren. 
\v 9 And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Menasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel from Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go unto the country of Gil'ad, to the land of their possession, whereof they were possessed, according to the order of the Lord by the hand of Moses. 
\v 10 And when they came unto the districts of the Jordan, that are in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Menasseh built there an altar by the Jordan, a great altar for a show. 
\v 11 And the children of Israel heard, as followeth, Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Menasseh have built an altar in the front of the land of Canaan, in the districts of the Jordan, at the side belonging to the children of Israel. 
\v 12 And when the children of Israel heard it, the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled themselves together at Shiloh, to go up against them to war. 
\v 13 And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Menasseh, into the land of Gil'ad, Phinehas the son of Elazar the priest. 
\v 14 And ten princes with him, one prince each for every division of all the tribes of Israel; and each one was a head of their family divisions among the thousands of Israel. 
\v 15 And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Menasseh, unto the land of Gil'ad, and they spoke with them, saying: 
\v 16 Thus have said the whole congregation of the Lord, What trespass is this that ye have committed against the God of Israel to turn away this day from following the Lord, in that ye have built yourselves an altar, that ye might rebel this day against the Lord? 
\v 17 Have we had too little in the iniquity of Peor,—from which we are not yet cleansed until this day,—when there was a plague in the congregation of the Lord? 
\v 18 And will ye turn away this day from following the Lord? and it will be, that when ye will rebel this day against the Lord, tomorrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of Israel. 
\v 19 But, notwithstanding, if the land of your possession be unclean, then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the Lord, wherein dwelleth the tabernacle of the Lord, and take possession in the midst of us; but rebel not against the Lord and against us do not rebel, in building yourselves an altar beside the altar of the Lord our God. 
\v 20 Did not 'Achan the son of Zerach commit a trespass on the devoted things, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and he, though but one man, perished not alone in his iniquity. 
\v 21 But the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Menasseh answered, and they spoke unto the heads of the thousands of Israel, 
\v 22 The God of gods, the Eternal, the God of gods, the Eternal, he knoweth, and Israel also shall know: if it be in rebellion, or if in transgression against the Lord, [aid us not this day,] 
\v 23 That we have built us an altar to turn away from following the Lord; or if to offer thereon burnt-offering or meat-offering, or if to offer thereon peace-offerings, may the Lord himself require it; 
\v 24 Or whether we have not done it for fear of this thing, saying, In time to come your children might say unto our children, as followeth, What have ye to do with the Lord, the God of Israel? 
\v 25 For the Lord hath made a boundary between us and you, ye children of Reuben and children of Gad,—the Jordan; ye have no part in the Lord: thus might your children make our children cease so as not to fear the Lord. 
\v 26 Wherefore we said, Let us now act for ourselves to build this altar, not for burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice; 
\v 27 But it shall be a witness between us, and you, and our generations after us, that we may perform the service of the Lord before him with our burnt-offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our, peace-offerings; and that your children may not say in time to come to our children, Ye have no portion in the Lord. 
\v 28 And we said, that it shall be !!when they should say this to us and to our generations in time to come, that we may say, Behold the pattern of the altar of the Lord, which our fathers made, not for burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice; but it is a witness between us and you. 
\v 29 Far be it from us that we should rebel against the Lord, and turn away this day from following the Lord, to build an altar for burnt-offering, for meat-offering, or for sacrifice, beside the altar of the Lord our God that is before his dwelling. 
\v 30 And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation and the heads of the thousands of Israel who were with him, heard the words which the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Menasseh had spoken, it was pleasing in their eyes. 
\v 31 And Phinehas the son of Elazar the priest said unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Menasseh, This day do we know that the Lord is in our midst, because ye have not committed this trespass against the Lord: now have ye delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the Lord. 
\v 32 And Phinehas the son of Elazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gil'ad, unto the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and they brought them word again. 
\v 33 And the thing was pleasing in the eyes of the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God; and they did not speak any more to go up against them to battle, to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and Gad dwelt. 
\v 34 And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar [“'Ed”]; for [they said] it is a witness between us that the Eternal is God.

\p
\v 1 And it came to pass after many days, after the Lord had given rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about, and Joshua had grown old and was well stricken in age, 
\v 2 That Joshua called for all Israel, for their elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and said unto them, I am become old and well stricken in age; 
\v 3 And ye have yourselves seen all that the Lord your God hath done unto all these nations, because of you; for the Lord your God it is that hath fought for you. 
\v 4 Behold, I have divided unto you by lot those nations that yet remain, to be an inheritance according to your tribes, from the Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, as far as the great sea, toward the setting of the sun. 
\v 5 And the Lord your God will indeed expel them from before you, and drive them out from before you; and ye shall possess their land, as the Lord your God hath spoken unto you. 
\v 6 But be ye very steadfast to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, so as not to turn aside therefrom to the right or to the left; 
\v 7 So as not to come among these nations, those that are left remaining near you; and of the name of their gods shall ye not make mention, nor cause any to swear thereby, neither shall ye serve them, nor bow yourselves down unto them; 
\v 8 But unto the Lord your God shall ye cleave, as ye have done unto this day. 
\v 9 And the Lord drove out from before you great and mighty nations; but as for you, no man hath been able to stand up before you unto this day. 
\v 10 One man of you can chase a thousand; for the Lord your God it is that fighteth for you, as he hath spoken unto you. 
\v 11 Take good heed therefore for your souls' sake, to love the Lord your God. 
\v 12 For if ye do in any wise turn back, and cleave unto the remnant of these nations, those that are left remaining near you, and make marriages with them, and come in among them, and they among you: 
\v 13 Know for a certainty that the Lord your God will no more drive out these nations from before you; but they shall be snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and stings in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which the Lord your God hath given you. 
\v 14 And, behold, I am going this day the way of all the earth; and ye know with all your heart and with all your soul, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the Lord your God spoke concerning you: all are come to pass unto you, not one thing thereof hath failed. 
\v 15 But it shall come to pass, that as every good thing is come upon you, which the Lord your God spoke unto you: so will the Lord bring upon you every evil thing, until he have destroyed you from off this good land which the Lord your God hath given unto you. 
\v 16 When ye transgress the covenant of the Lord your God, which he hath commanded you, and go and serve other gods, and bow yourselves down to them: then will the anger of the Lord be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given unto you.

\v 1 And Joshua assembled all the tribes of Israel to Shechem; and he called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and they presented themselves before God. 
\v 2 And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus hath said the Lord the God of Israel, On the other side of the river did your fathers dwell in old time, even Terach, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor; and they served other gods. 
\v 3 And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the river, and I led him throughout all the land of Canaan; and I multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac. 
\v 4 And I gave unto Isaac, Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt. 
\v 5 And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt in the manner as I have done among them; and after that I brought you out. 
\v 6 And I brought your fathers out of Egypt; and ye came unto the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the Red Sea. 
\v 7 And they cried unto the Lord, and he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and he brought the sea over them, and covered them; and your eyes saw what I had done on Egypt; and ye dwelt in the wilderness many days. 
\v 8 And I brought you into the land of the Emorites, that dwelt on the other side of the Jordan; and they fought with you: and I gave them into your hand, and ye took possession of their land; and I destroyed them from before you. 
\v 9 Then Balak the son of Zippor, the king of Moab, arose and warred against Israel; and he sent and called Bil'am the son of Beor to curse you; 
\v 10 And I would not hearken unto Bil'am; but he had to bless you instead: and I delivered you out of his hand. 
\v 11 And ye passed over the Jordan, and came unto Jericho; and then fought the men of Jericho against you, the Emorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I gave them up into your hand. 
\v 12 And I sent before you the hornet which drove them out from before you, even the two kings of the Emorites: not with thy sword, and not with thy bow. 
\v 13 And I gave you a land for which ye had not toiled, and cities which ye had not built, and ye dwell in them; of vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat. 
\v 14 Now therefore fear the Lord, and serve him in sincerity and truth; and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the river and in Egypt, and serve the Lord. 
\v 15 And if it be displeasing in your eyes to serve the Lord, choose for yourselves this day whom ye will serve: whether the gods which your fathers that were on the other side of the river served, or the gods of the Emorites, in whose land ye dwell; but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord. 
\v 16 And the people answered and said, Far be it from us to forsake the Lord, to serve other gods; 
\v 17 For the Lord our God it is that hath brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, from the house of slavery, and who hath done those great signs before our eyes, and preserved us upon all the way whereon we have gone, and among all the people through the midst of whom we have passed: 
\v 18 And the Lord hath driven out all the nations, and the Emorites who dwelt in the land, from before us; therefore also will we serve the Lord; for he is our God. 
\v 19 And Joshua said unto the people, Ye will not be able to serve the Lord; for he is a holy God; he is a watchful God; he will not have any indulgence for your transgressions and for your sins; 
\v 20 If ye forsake the Lord, and serve strange gods, then will he again do ye evil, and consume ye, after that he hath done you good. 
\v 21 And the people said unto Joshua, No; nevertheless the Lord will we serve. 
\v 22 And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye yourselves have chosen for you the Lord, to serve him. And they said, We are witnesses. 
\v 23 And now put away the strange gods which are in the midst of you, and incline your heart unto the Lord the God of Israel. 
\v 24 And the people said unto Joshua, The Lord our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey. 
\v 25 And Joshua made a covenant with the people on that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem. 
\v 26 And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God; and he took a great stone, and set it up there under the oak, that was by the sanctuary of the Lord. 
\v 27 And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be among us as a witness; for it hath heard all the words of the Lord which he spoke unto us: it shall be therefore as a witness against you, that ye may not deny your God. 
\v 28 And Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance. 
\v 29 And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died, one hundred and ten years old. 
\v 30 And they buried him on the border of his inheritance at Timnath-serach, which is on the mountain of Ephraim, on the north side of mount Ga'ash. 
\v 31 And Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who lived many days after Joshua, and who had known all the deeds of the Lord, that he had done for Israel. 
\v 32 And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel had brought up out of Egypt, they buried in Shechem, in a parcel of the field which Jacob had bought of the sons of Chamor the father of Shechem for one hundred kessitah: and it remained the inheritance of the children of Joseph. 
\v 33 And Elazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him on the hill of Phinehas his son, which was given him in the mountain of Ephraim.
