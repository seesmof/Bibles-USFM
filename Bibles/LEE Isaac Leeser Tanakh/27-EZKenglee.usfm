\v 1 And it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I was in the midst of the exiles by the river Kebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw divine visions. 
\v 2 On the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of the exile of king Jehoyachin, 
\v 3 Came the word of the Lord expressly unto Ezekiel the son of Buzi, the priest, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Kebar; and there came upon him there the inspiration of the Lord. 
\v 4 And I saw, and behold, a storm-wind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a flaming fire, and a brightness was on it round about; and out of the midst of it was like the glitter of amber, out of the midst of the fire. 
\v 5 And out of the midst thereof [I saw] the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: They had the likeness of a man. 
\v 6 And every one had four faces, and every one of them had four wings. 
\v 7 And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like the glitter of burnished copper. 
\v 8 And hands of man [were visible] from beneath their wings on their four sides: and their faces and their wings [were alike] on all these four. 
\v 9 Their wings were joined one to the other: they turned not about in their going; they went every one in the direction of one of their faces. 
\v 10 And the likeness of their faces was the face of a man; and the face of a lion, on the right side for all four of them; and the face of an ox on the left side for all four of them; and the face of an eagle for all four of them. 
\v 11 Thus were their faces: and their wings were spread out upward; every one had two joined one to another, and two covered their bodies. 
\v 12 And they went every one in the direction of one of his faces: whither the spirit was directed to go, they went; they turned not about in their going. 
\v 13 As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like coals of fire, burning as with the appearance of torches; this [fire] it was which passed along between the living creatures: and a brightness was about the fire, and out of the fire went forth lightning. 
\v 14 And the living creatures ran backward and forward like the appearance of a flash of lightning. 
\v 15 And I looked on the living creatures, and, behold, there was one wheel upon the earth close by the living creatures, by their four front faces. 
\v 16 The appearance of the wheels and their work was like the color of a chrysolite; and all four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as though it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel. 
\v 17 Toward their four sides they went in their going: they turned not round in their going. 
\v 18 As for their circumferences, they were so high that they excited fear: and their felloes were full of eyes round about on all these four. 
\v 19 And when the living creatures went, the wheels went near to them: and when the living creatures lifted themselves up from the earth, the wheels lifted themselves up. 
\v 20 Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went; [for] thither was [their] spirit to go: and the wheels lifted themselves up at the same time with them; for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. 
\v 21 When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those lifted themselves up from the earth, the wheels lifted themselves up at the same time with them; for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. 
\v 22 And the likeness of a vault was over the head of the living creatures, [shining] like the glitter of the purest crystal, stretched forth over their heads above. 
\v 23 And under the vault their wings were straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered them, and every one had two, which covered them,—[namely,] their bodies. 
\v 24 And I heard the sound of their wings, like the sound of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, when they went, the sound of [their] speech, as the noise of an army: when they stood still, they let down their wings. 
\v 25 And there was a voice from the vault that was over their head: when they stood still, they let down their wings. 
\v 26 And above the vault that was over their head was like the appearance of a sapphire-stone, the likeness of a throne: and upon the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it. 
\v 27 And I saw as if it were the glitter of amber, as the appearance of fire within it round about, from the appearance of his loins upward; and from the appearance of his loins downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about. 
\v 28 Like the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud on the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about: this was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard the voice of one that spoke. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 And he said unto me, Son of man, stand up upon thy feet, and I will speak with thee. 
\v 2 And a spirit entered into me as he spoke unto me, and it placed me upon my feet, and I heard him that spoke unto me. 
\v 3 And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to rebellious tribes that have rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, even until this very day. 
\v 4 And the children are impudent of face, and obdurate of heart: I send thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal. 
\v 5 And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, [for they are a rebellious family,] shall yet know that a prophet hath been among them. 
\v 6 And thou, son of man,—thou shalt not be afraid of them, and of their words thou shalt have no fear, though they be briers and thorns with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: of their words be not afraid, and at their presence be not dismayed; for they are a rebellious family. 
\v 7 And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear; for they are rebellious. 
\v 8 But thou, son of man, hear what I am speaking unto thee, Be not thou rebellious like this rebellious family: open thy mouth, and eat what I give unto thee. 
\v 9 And then I looked, and behold, a hand was stretched out toward me; and, lo, a roll-book was therein; 
\v 10 And he spread it out before me; and it was written within and without: and there were written therein lamentations, and dirges, and woe. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 And he said unto me, Son of man, eat what thou findest: eat this roll, and go, speak unto the house of Israel. 
\v 2 So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat this roll. 
\v 3 And he said unto me, Son of man, feed thy belly, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I am giving unto thee. And I ate it; and it was in my mouth like honey in sweetness. 
\v 4 And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them. 
\v 5 For not to a people of an obscure speech and of a difficult tongue art thou sent, but to the house of Israel; 
\v 6 Not to many people of an obscure speech and of a difficult tongue, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would truly have hearkened unto thee. 
\v 7 But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me; for all the house of Israel have a bold forehead, and a hard heart. 
\v 8 Behold, I have made thy face strong against their face, and thy forehead strong against their forehead. 
\v 9 As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: thou shalt not fear them, nor shalt thou be dismayed at their presence, though they be a rebellious family. 
\v 10 And he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I will speak unto thee receive in thy heart, and hear [them] with thy ears. 
\v 11 And go, get thee to those in exile, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal: whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear. 
\v 12 Then a spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, [saying,] Blessed be the glory of the Lord from his place. 
\v 13 [I heard] also the sound of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the sound of the wheels at the same time with them, and the sound of a great rushing. 
\v 14 So a spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I walked in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit, and the inspiration of the Lord was strong upon me. 
\v 15 Then came I to the exiles at Tel-abib, who dwelt by the river Kebar, and I remained where they dwelt, and I remained there in a state of confusion among them seven days. 
\v 16 And it came to pass at the end of seven days, That the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
\v 17 Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: and thou shalt hear the word out of my mouth, and give them warning from me. 
\v 18 When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou dost not give him warning, and speakest not to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life: the same wicked man shall die through his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thy hand. 
\v 19 But thou,—if thou hast warned the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way: he shall indeed die in his iniquity; but thou hast surely delivered thy soul. 
\v 20 Again, When a righteous man do turn from his righteousness, and do what is wrong: then will I lay a stumbling-block before him, [so that] he shall die; yet if thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his acts of righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require from thy hand. 
\v 21 But if thou hast truly warned him,—the righteous, that the righteous should not sin, and he doth not sin: he shall surely live, because he attended to the warning, and thou hast surely delivered thy own soul. 
\v 22 And the inspiration of the Lord came there over me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the valley, and there will I speak with thee. 
\v 23 And I arose, and went forth into the valley; and, behold, there was the glory of the Lord standing, like that glory which I had seen by the river Kebar: and I fell down on my face. 
\v 24 Then entered a spirit into me, and placed me upright on my feet, and spoke with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself up within thy house. 
\v 25 But thou, O son of man, behold, they put ropes upon thee, and bind thee with them, that thou canst not go out among them: 
\v 26 And I will let thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not become to them a man who reproveth; for they are a rebellious family. 
\v 27 But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forebear; for they are a rebellious family. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 But thou, O son of man, take thyself a tile, and lay it before thee, and engrave upon it a city, [namely,] Jerusalem: 
\v 2 And place around it a siege, and build works of attack against it, and cast up a mound against it; and arrange around it encampments, and place against it battering rams round about. 
\v 3 Moreover take thou unto thyself an iron pan, and set it up as a wall of iron between thee and the city: and direct thy face against it, that it may be placed in a state of siege, and lay siege against it. This shall be a sign for the house of Israel. 
\v 4 And as for thyself, lie upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it: [after] the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it shalt thou bear their iniquity. 
\v 5 But as for myself, I lay upon thee the years of their iniquity, after the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel. 
\v 6 And when thou hast made an end of them, thou shalt lie on thy right side, the second time, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: a day each for a year, a day for a year do I lay it on thee. 
\v 7 And toward the siege of Jerusalem shalt thou direct thy face with thy arm uncovered, and thou shalt prophesy against it. 
\v 8 And, behold, I will lay ropes upon thee, that thou mayest not turn thyself from one side to the other, till thou hast made an end of the days of thy siege. 
\v 9 But thou take unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentiles, and millet, and spelt, and put them in one vessel, and make thyself bread thereof, [after] the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side, three hundred and ninety days, shalt thou eat it. 
\v 10 And thy food which thou shalt eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels for every day: from one time to the other time shalt thou eat it. 
\v 11 And water shalt thou drink by measure, the sixth part of a hin: from one time to the other time shalt thou drink [it]. 
\v 12 And in form of a barley-cake shalt thou eat it, and this shalt thou bake with balls of human excrement before their eyes. 
\v 13 And the Lord said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their bread unclean among the nations whither I will drive them. 
\v 14 Then said I, Ah Lord Eternal! behold, my soul hath not been defiled; and that which dieth of itself, or is torn in pieces, have I never eaten from my youth up even until now; and never is flesh of abomination come into my mouth. 
\v 15 Then said he unto me, Lo, I have given thee cow's dung instead of human excrement; and thou shalt prepare thy bread thereupon. 
\v 16 And he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem; and they shall eat bread by weight, and with anxious care; and they shall drink water by measure, and in confusion; 
\v 17 In order that they may want bread and water, and be confounded one with the other, and pine away for their iniquity. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 And thou, son of man, take unto thyself a sharp sword, a barber's razor shalt thou take for it unto thyself, and cause it to pass over thy head and over thy beard: then take unto thee balances for weighing, and divide the hair. 
\v 2 One third part shalt thou burn with fire in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are completed; and thou shalt take another third part, and smite [it] round about it with the sword; and the other third part shalt thou scatter to the wind: and I will draw out a sword after the same. 
\v 3 And take thence a few in number, and tie them up in the corners of thy garment. 
\v 4 And from these again shalt thou take some, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire: therefrom shall a fire go forth unto all the house of Israel. 
\v 5 Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, This is Jerusalem, which I had set it in the midst of the nations and countries that are round about her. 
\v 6 But she rebelled against my ordinances more wickedly than the nations, and against my statutes, more than the countries that are round about her; for my ordinances they have despised, and as for my statutes, they have not walked in them. 
\v 7 Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Because ye have given yourselves up to evil more than the nations that are round about you, have not walked in my statutes, and have not executed my ordinances, and not even acted according to the ordinances of the nations that are round about you: 
\v 8 Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I, also I am against thee, and I will execute judgments in the midst of thee before the eyes of the nations. 
\v 9 And I will do in thee that which I have never done, and the like of which I will never do any more, because of all thy abominations. 
\v 10 Therefore fathers shall devour their children in the midst of thee, and children shall devour their fathers: and I will execute judgments on thee, and I will scatter all thy remnant unto all the winds. 
\v 11 Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord Eternal, Surely, because thou hast made unclean my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and with all thy abominations: therefore will I also diminish [thee]; and my eye shall not show pity, and I also will not spare. 
\v 12 A third part of thee shall die through the pestilence, and come through famine to their end in the midst of thee; and another third part shall fall by the sword round about thee; and the other third part will I scatter unto all the winds, and a sword will I draw out after them. 
\v 13 Thus shall my anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to rest upon them, and I will satisfy myself: and they shall know that I the Lord have spoken it in my zeal, when I have let out all my fury on them. 
\v 14 Yea, I will render thee a ruin, and a disgrace among the nations that are round about thee, before the eyes of every one that passeth by. 
\v 15 And she shall be a disgrace and a taunt, a warning and an astonishment unto the nations that are round about thee, when I execute judgments on thee in anger and in fury and in furious chastisements,—I the Lord have spoken it,— 
\v 16 When I send out among them the dreadful arrows of famine, which [ever] were the cause of destruction, which I will send out to destroy you; and I will increase the famine upon you, and will break unto you the staff of bread: 
\v 17 So will I let loose over you famine and wild beasts, and they shall make thee childless; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; and the sword will I bring over thee. I the Lord have spoken it. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1 And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
\v 2 Son of man, set thy face against the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them, 
\v 3 And thou shalt say, O mountains of Israel, hear ye the word of the Lord Eternal! Thus hath said the Lord Eternal to the mountains, and to the hills, to the brooks, and to the valleys, Behold, I, even I, will bring over you the sword, and I will destroy your high-places. 
\v 4 And your altars shall be made desolate, and your sun-images shall be broken: and I will cause your slain ones to fall before your idols. 
\v 5 And I will lay the carcasses of the children of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars. 
\v 6 In all your dwelling-places the cities shall be laid in ruins, and the high-places shall be made desolate; in order that your altars may be laid in ruins and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and annihilated, and your sun-images may be cut down, and your works may be blotted out. 
\v 7 And the slain shall fall in the midst of you: and ye shall know that I am the Lord. 
\v 8 Yet will I leave [some]; that ye shall have some that escape the sword among the nations, when ye shall be scattered in the [various] countries. 
\v 9 And those of you that escape shall remember me among the nations among whom they shall have been carried captive, when I shall have broken their licentious heart, which had departed from me, even with their eyes, which were gone astray after their idols: and they shall loathe themselves on account of the evil deeds which they have committed with all their abominations. 
\v 10 And they shall know that I am the Lord: not for naught have I spoken that I would do unto them this evil. 
\v 11 Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Strike thy hands together, and stamp with thy foot, and say, Alas for all the dreadful abominations of the house of Israel! who will have to fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence. 
\v 12 He that is afar off shall die of the pestilence; and he that is near shall fall by the sword; and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine: thus will I let out all my fury on them. 
\v 13 And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when their slain ones shall lie in the midst of their idols round about their altars, on every high hill, upon all the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick-branched oak,—places where they presented sweet savor to all their idols. 
\v 14 And I will stretch out my hand over them, and I will render the land desolate and waste, more than the wilderness toward Diblath, in all their habitations: and they shall know that I am the Lord. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1 And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
\v 2 And thou, son of man, thus hath said the Lord Eternal concerning the land of Israel, There is an end! the end is coming over the four corners of the land. 
\v 3 Now cometh the end over thee, and I will let loose my anger against thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways, and I will lay upon thee all thy abominations. 
\v 4 And my eye shall not show pity upon thee, and I will not spare thee; for thy own ways will I lay upon thee, and thy abominations shall come in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I am the Lord. 
\v 5 Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, An evil, a peculiar evil, behold, is coming. 
\v 6 An end is coming, there is coming the end: it waketh up against thee; behold, [the evil] cometh. 
\v 7 The evil decree is come against thee, O thou inhabitant of the land: the time is come, near is the day of tumult, and not the joyful call on the mountains. 
\v 8 Now will I in a short time pour out my fury over thee, and I will let out all my anger against thee, and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and I will lay upon thee all thy abominations. 
\v 9 And my eye shall not show pity, and I will not spare: according to thy ways will I lay [evil] on thee, and thy abominations shall come in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I am the Lord that smiteth. 
\v 10 Behold the day, behold, it is coming; the evil decree is gone forth; the staff hath blossomed, presumption hath budded; 
\v 11 The violence is grown up into the staff of wickedness: nothing is left of them, and nothing of their multitude, and nothing of theirs; and there shall be no lamenting for them. 
\v 12 The time is coming, the day occurreth; let the buyer not rejoice, and let the seller not mourn; for wrath is against all her multitude. 
\v 13 For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although their soul were yet alive; for the vision is against all her multitude; no one shall return; but the soul of every one is fastened to his iniquity, they do not strengthen themselves [to repent]. 
\v 14 They have blown the cornet, every one maketh himself ready; but no one goeth to the battle; for my wrath is against all her multitude. 
\v 15 The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine are within: he that is in the field shall die by the sword; and he that is in the city, him shall famine and pestilence devour. 
\v 16 But they that escape of them shall escape, and they shall be on the mountains like the doves of the valleys, all of which are moaning, every one in his iniquity. 
\v 17 All hands become feeble, and all knees go into water. 
\v 18 And people gird themselves with sackcloth, and shuddering covereth them: and upon all faces there is shame, and upon all their heads there is baldness. 
\v 19 Their silver shall they cast into the streets, and their gold shall be as though it were unclean: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them on the day of the wrath of the Lord; they shall not satisfy their souls, and not fill their bowels; because it was the stumbling-block for their iniquity. 
\v 20 And as for the beauty of his ornament, which he had instituted for [their] pride: even therein did they make the images of their abominations, their detestable things; therefore have I rendered it unclean for them. 
\v 21 And I will give it up into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil: and they shall pollute it. 
\v 22 And I will turn away my face from them, and they shall pollute my place where I dwelt in secret; and therein shall barbarians enter and pollute it. 
\v 23 Make chains; for the land is full of blood-guiltiness, and the city is full of violence. 
\v 24 Therefore will I bring the worst of nations, and they shall take possession of their houses: I will also cause the pride of the mighty to cease; and their holy places shall be polluted. 
\v 25 Destruction cometh: and they will seek peace, but there shall be none. 
\v 26 Mishap shall come upon mishap, and report shall be spread upon report: and then will they seek a vision from the prophet; but the law shall be lost from the priest, and counsel from the ancients. 
\v 27 The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with distress, and the hands of the people of the land shall be powerless: after their way will I do unto them, and according to their own manners will I judge them; and they shall know that I am the Lord. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth day of the month, that I was sitting in my house, and the elders of Judah were sitting before me; and there fell upon me there the inspiration of the Lord Eternal. 
\v 2 And I saw, and, behold, there was a likeness similar to the appearance of fire; from the appearance of his loins downward, it was fire; and from his loins upward, it was similar to the appearance of a bright light, like the glitter of amber. 
\v 3 And he stretched forth the form of a hand, and took me by the locks of my head; and a spirit bore me between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate that looketh toward the north, where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provoketh to wrath. 
\v 4 And, behold, there was the glory of the God of Israel, like the appearance which I had seen in the valley. 
\v 5 And he said unto me, Son of man, do but lift up thy eyes in the direction toward the north. So I lifted up my eyes in the direction toward the north, and behold northward at the gate of the altar [there was] this image of jealousy at the entrance. 
\v 6 Then said he unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they are doing? great abominations are they that the house of Israel commit here, to make me go far away from my sanctuary; but thou shalt yet see still other great abominations. 
\v 7 And he brought me to the door of the court: and I looked, and behold there was a hole in the wall. 
\v 8 Then said he unto me, Son of man, do break [an opening] in the wall: and I broke [an opening] in the wall, and, behold, there was a door. 
\v 9 And he said unto me, Go in, and see the wicked abominations which they are doing here. 
\v 10 So I went in and saw; and behold there was every form of creeping things, and cattle, abominations, and all the idols of the house of Israel, engraven upon the wall all round about. 
\v 11 And seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, and Yaazanyahu the son of Shaphan standing in the midst of them, were standing before them, and every man had his censer in his hand; and a thick curling cloud of incense was ascending upward. 
\v 12 Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the dark, every man in his image-chambers? for they say, The Lord seeth us not: the Lord hath forsaken the earth. 
\v 13 And he said unto me, Thou shalt yet again see still other great abominations that they are doing. 
\v 14 And he brought me to the entrance of the gate of the Lord's house which was on the north side: and, behold, there sat the women weeping for Thammuz. 
\v 15 Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? Thou shalt yet again see still other greater abominations than these. 
\v 16 And he brought me into the inner court of the Lord's house, and, behold, at the door of the temple of the Lord, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of the Lord, and their faces toward the east; and they were prostrating themselves eastward to the sun. 
\v 17 Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? Is it too light a thing for the house of Judah to commit the abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and they constantly repeat to provoke me to anger; and, lo, they stretch forth the branch to their nose. 
\v 18 Therefore I also will deal in fury; my eye shall not look with pity, and I will not spare: and though they call before my ears with a loud voice, will I still not hear them. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 And he called before my ears with a loud voice, saying, Let those come near that have charge to punish the city, and every man with his destroying weapon in his hand. 
\v 2 And, behold, six men came from the direction of the upper gate, which is turned toward the north, and every man with his weapon of destruction in his hand; and one man in the midst of them was clothed in linen, with a writer's materials by his side: and they went in, and placed themselves beside the copper altar. 
\v 3 And the glory of the God of Israel ascended up from the cherub, whereupon it had been, to the threshold of the house. And he called to the man clothed in linen, who had the writer's materials by his side. 
\v 4 And the Lord said unto him, Pass through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and inscribe a mark upon the foreheads of the men who sigh and who complain because of all the abominations which are done in the midst of it. 
\v 5 And to the others he said before my ears, Pass ye through the city after him, and smite: let your eye not look with pity, and do not spare; 
\v 6 The aged, youth, and virgin, and little children, and women shall ye slay and destroy; but come not near any man upon whom the mark is; and at my sanctuary shall ye begin. Then they began with the ancient men who were before the house. 
\v 7 And he said unto them, Make unclean the house, and fill the courts with the slain: go forth. And they went forth, and they smote in the city. 
\v 8 And it came to pass, while they were smiting them, and I alone was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried out, and said, Ah Lord Eternal! wilt thou destroy all the residue of Israel when thou pourest out thy fury over Jerusalem? 
\v 9 Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and of Judah is exceedingly great, and the land is full of blood-guiltiness, and the city full of injustice; for they have said, The Lord hath forsaken the land, and the Lord seeth not. 
\v 10 And as for me also, my eye shall not look with pity, and I will not spare; but I will bring their course upon their own head. 
\v 11 And, behold, the man clothed in linen, who had the writing materials by his side, brought back word, saying, I have done according to all that thou hast commanded me. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1 Then I saw, and, behold, on the vault that was above the head of the cherubim, there appeared over them something like a sapphire stone, something similar in appearance to the likeness of a throne. 
\v 2 And he said unto the man clothed in linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, under the cherub, and fill thy hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and throw [them] over the city. And he went in before my eyes. 
\v 3 Now the cherubim were standing on the right side of the house, when the man went in: and the cloud filled the inner court. 
\v 4 Then the glory of the Lord rose upward from the cherub, toward the threshold of the house: and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the Lord's glory. 
\v 5 And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard as far as the outer court, like the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh. 
\v 6 And it came to pass, when he commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the cherubim, that he went in, and stood beside the wheel. 
\v 7 And the one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim unto the fire that was between the cherubim, and lifted it up, and placed it into the hands of the one clothed in linen; who took it, and went out. 
\v 8 And there became visible on the cherubim the form of a man's hand beneath their wings. 
\v 9 And I saw, and, behold, there were four wheels by the cherubim, one wheel by the one cherub, and another wheel by the other cherub: and the appearance of the wheels was like the glitter of a chrysolite stone. 
\v 10 And as for their appearances, the whole four had one likeness, as if a wheel were in the midst of another wheel. 
\v 11 In their going, they went toward their four sides, they turned not round in their going; but to the place whither the head was turned they followed it, they turned not round in their going. 
\v 12 And their whole body, and their back, and their hands, and their wings, as also the wheels, were full of eyes round about, [even] the wheels that belonged to all four of them. 
\v 13 As for the wheels, they were called Galgal before my ears. 
\v 14 And every one had four faces: the one face was the face of a cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third face was the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle. 
\v 15 And the cherubim lifted themselves up. This is the living creature that I saw by the river Kebar. 
\v 16 And when the cherubim went forward, the wheels went close by them; and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the wheels also did not turn away from beside them. 
\v 17 When those halted, these halted; and when those lifted themselves up, these lifted themselves up with them; for the spirit of the living creature was in them. 
\v 18 And the glory of the Lord went forth from off the threshold of the house, and halted over the cherubim. 
\v 19 And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth before my eyes as they went forth, and the wheels at the same time with them, and halted at the entrance of the east gate of the house of the Lord: and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above. 
\v 20 This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Kebar; and I understood that they were cherubim. 
\v 21 Every one had four faces apiece, and every one had four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings. 
\v 22 And the likeness of their faces was the same as the faces which I had seen by the river Kebar, their appearances and themselves: they went every one in the direction of his face. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 And a spirit bore me up, and brought me unto the east gate of the house of the Lord, which looketh eastward: and behold, there were at the entrance of the gate five and twenty men; and I saw in the midst of them Yaazanyah the son of 'Azzur, and Pelatyahu the son of Benayahu, princes of the people. 
\v 2 Then said he unto me, Son of man, these are the men that devise wickedness, and give evil counsel in this city; 
\v 3 Who say, [The evil] is not near; so let us build houses: this [city] is the pot, and we are the flesh. 
\v 4 Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man. 
\v 5 And the Spirit of the Lord fell upon me, and said unto me, Speak, Thus hath said the Lord, Thus have ye said, O house of Israel; and whatever cometh into your mind, do I know full well. 
\v 6 Ye have multiplied those slain by you in this city, and ye have filled its streets with the slain. 
\v 7 Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Those slain by you whom ye have struck down in the midst of it, —they are the flesh, and this place is the pot; but you are to be removed out of the midst of it. 
\v 8 The sword have ye feared: and the sword will I bring over you, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\v 9 And I will remove you out of the midst of it, and I will give you up into the hand of strangers, and will execute punishments among you. 
\v 10 By the sword shall ye fall; on the boundary of Israel will I judge you: and ye shall know that I am the Lord. 
\v 11 This place shall not be unto you as a pot, so that you should be as flesh in the midst of it; but on the boundary of Israel will I judge you. 
\v 12 And ye shall know that I am the Lord: because in my statutes have ye not walked, and my ordinances have ye not executed; but ye have done after the ordinances of the nations that are round about you. 
\v 13 And it came to pass, as I was prophesying, that Pelatyahu the son of Benayah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord Eternal! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel? 
\v 14 Then came the word of the Lord unto me, saying, 
\v 15 Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and the whole house of Israel altogether, are they unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Remain you far from the Lord: unto us is this land given for a possession. 
\v 16 Therefore say, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Although I have removed them far away among the nations, and although I have scattered them among the countries: yet will I be to them as a minor sanctuary in the countries whither they are come. 
\v 17 Therefore say, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, I will both gather you from the people, and assemble you out of the countries whether ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel. 
\v 18 And they shall come thither, and they shall remove all its detestable things, and all its abominations out of it. 
\v 19 And I will give them one single heart, and a new spirit will I put within you; and I will remove the heart of stone out of their body, and I will give unto them a heart of flesh: 
\v 20 In order that they may walk in my statutes, and keep my ordinances, and do them; and they shall be unto me for a people, and I will indeed be unto them for a God. 
\v 21 But as for those whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, their way do I bring upon their own head, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\v 22 Then did the cherubim lift up their wings, and the wheels at the same time with them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above. 
\v 23 And the glory of the Lord ascended from the midst of the city, and halted upon the mount which is on the east side of the city. 
\v 24 But a spirit bore me up, and brought me into Chaldea, to those in exile, in the appearance through the spirit of God: and then ascended away from me the appearance which I had seen. 
\v 25 Then did I speak unto those in exile all the things that the Lord had shown me. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 The word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
\v 2 Son of man, in the midst of a rebellious family art thou dwelling, who have eyes to see, and see not; who have ears to hear, and hear not; for they are a rebellious family. 
\v 3 But thou, O son of man, prepare for thyself vessels for going into exile, and wander away by day before their eyes; and thou shalt wander away from thy place to another place before their eyes: perhaps they may become aware that they are a rebellious family. 
\v 4 Then shalt thou carry forth thy vessels, like vessels of exile, by day before their eyes: and thou shalt go forth at evening before their eyes, as they do that go forth into exile. 
\v 5 Before their eyes break a hole through the wall, and carry [them] through it. 
\v 6 Before their [eyes] shalt thou bear them upon thy shoulders, in the dark shalt thou carry them forth: thy face shalt thou cover, that thou mayest not see the ground; for as a token have I set thee unto the house of Israel. 
\v 7 And I did so as I had been commanded; my vessels I carried forth by day, like vessels of exile, and in the evening I broke a hole for myself through the wall with my hand: in the dark I brought them forth, and I bore them upon my shoulder before their eyes. 
\v 8 And the word of the Lord came unto me in the morning, saying, 
\v 9 Son of man, have not the house of Israel, the rebellious family, said unto thee, What doest thou? 
\v 10 Say thou unto them, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, For the prince in Jerusalem is the doom, and for all the house of Israel, [and those] that are in the midst of them. 
\v 11 Say, I am your token; just as I have done, so shall it be done unto them: into exile, into captivity, shall they wander. 
\v 12 And the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the dark, and shall go forth; through the wall shall they break a hole to carry [things] through it: his face shall he cover up, that he may not see the ground with his eyes. 
\v 13 And I will spread out my net over him, and he shall be caught in my snare: and I will bring him to Babylon into the land of the Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it, and there shall he die. 
\v 14 And all that are round about him, those who assist him, and all the wings of his armies will I disperse toward every wind; and the sword will I draw out after them. 
\v 15 And they shall know that I am the Lord, when I scatter them among the nations, and disperse them in the countries. 
\v 16 But I will leave of them men few in number from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence: in order that they may relate all their abominations among the nations whither they shall have come; and they shall know that I am the Lord. 
\v 17 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, 
\v 18 Son of man, thy bread shalt thou eat with quaking, and thy water shalt thou drink with trembling and with anxious care. 
\v 19 And thou shalt say unto the people of the land, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem, [and] concerning the land of Israel, Their bread shall they eat with anxious care, and their water shall they drink with confusion, for the cause that her land will be desolate, deprived of its plenteousness because of the violence of all those that dwell therein. 
\v 20 And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid in ruins, and the land shall be made desolate: and ye shall know that I am the Lord. 
\v 21 And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
\v 22 Son of man, what sort of proverb is that which ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are lasting long, and lost is every vision? 
\v 23 Therefore say unto them, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, I will cause this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but speak unto them, The days are coming nigh, and the word of every vision. 
\v 24 For there shall be no more any false vision and a deceptive divination within the house of Israel. 
\v 25 For I am the Lord,—I do speak, and whatever word I do speak shall be done; it shall not be delayed any more; for in your days, O rebellious family, will I speak the word, and I will execute it, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\v 26 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, 
\v 27 Son of man, behold, the house of Israel say, The vision that he foreseeth is for distant days, and for times that are far off doth he prophesy. 
\v 28 Therefore say unto them, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, There shall not be delayed any more one of all my words; but whatever word I do speak shall be done, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
\v 2 Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say thou unto those that prophesy out of their own heart, Hear ye the word of the Lord: 
\v 3 Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Woe unto the scandalous prophets, that follow their own spirit, without having seen any thing! 
\v 4 Like foxes among the ruins have been thy prophets, O Israel! 
\v 5 Ye did not go up into the breaches, nor did ye make a fence around the house of Israel to stand in the battle on the day of the Lord. 
\v 6 They saw falsehood and lying divination, they who say, “The Lord saith,” when the Lord had not sent them; and yet they made others hope for the fulfillment of the word. 
\v 7 Had ye not seen a false vision, and had ye not said a lying divination? and ye say, “The Lord saith,” when I have not spoken. 
\v 8 Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Whereas ye have spoken falsehood, and have seen lies: therefore, behold, I am against you, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\v 9 And my hand shall be against the prophets that see false-hood, and that divine lies; in the secret council of my people shall they not be, and in the register of the house of Israel shall they not be written, and into the land of Israel shall they not come: and ye shall know that I am the Lord Eternal. 
\v 10 Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, “Peace,” when there was no peace: and [my people] build a protecting wall, and lo, they plaster it with unadhesive mortar. 
\v 11 Say unto those who plaster it with unadhesive mortar, that it shall fall: there cometh an overflowing rain-shower; and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a storm-wind shall rend it. 
\v 12 And, lo, the wall is fallen down; will it not now be said unto you, Where is the plastering wherewith ye have plastered? 
\v 13 Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, I will even rend it with storm-winds in my fury; and an overflowing rain-shower shall come in my anger, with great hailstones in my fury to destroy it. 
\v 14 And I will pull down the wall that ye have plastered with unadhesive mortar, and I will cast it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be laid open; and it shall fall, and ye shall be destroyed in the midst of it: and ye shall know that I am the Lord. 
\v 15 Thus will I let out all my wrath upon the wall, and upon those that have plastered it with unadhesive mortar; and I will say unto you, Gone is the wall, and gone are they that plastered it; 
\v 16 [Namely,] the prophets of Israel who prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and who see for her a vision of peace, when there is no peace, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\v 17 But, thou son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people, who prophesy out of their own heart: and prophesy against them, 
\v 18 And say, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Woe to the women that sew bolsters together for the armpits of all, and make cushions for the head of every stature, to hunt souls! Will ye hunt the souls of my people, that ye may keep your own soul alive? 
\v 19 And ye profane me among my people for handfuls of barley and for bits of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to keep alive the souls that should not live, by your lying to my people that listen to lies! 
\v 20 Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I am against your bolsters, whereon ye hunt the souls that they may flutter [in your net], and I will tear them away from your arms; and I will let the souls go free, even the souls that ye hunt that they may flutter [in your net.] 
\v 21 And I will tear away your cushions, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted: and ye shall know that I am the Lord. 
\v 22 Because ye grieve the heart of the righteous with falsehood, when I have not given him pain; and strengthen the hands of the wicked, so that he should not return from his wicked way, through which he might live. 
\v 23 Therefore shall ye see no more falsehood, and tell no more divinations; and I will deliver my people out of your hand: and ye shall know that I am the Lord. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1 Then came there unto me certain men of the elders of Israel, and sat down before me. 
\v 2 And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
\v 3 Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart, and the stumbling-block of their iniquity have they placed before their faces: shall I in any wise let myself be inquired of by them? 
\v 4 Therefore speak with them and say unto them, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Whatever man it be of the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in his heart, and layeth the stumbling-block of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet: I the Lord will answer him, although he cometh with the multitude of his idols; 
\v 5 In order that I may grasp the house of Israel by their heart, those who are separated from me through all their idols. 
\v 6 Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Return, and cause [your heart] to turn away from your idols: and from all your abominations turn away your faces. 
\v 7 For whatever man it be of the house of Israel, or of the stranger that sojourneth in Israel, that separateth himself from me, and setteth up his idols in his heart, and layeth the stumbling-block of his iniquity before his face, and then cometh to the prophet to inquire through him of me: I the Lord will answer him through my word; 
\v 8 And I will set my face against that man, and will make him an astonishment for a sign and for proverbs, and I will cut him off from the midst of my people; and ye shall know that I am the Lord. 
\v 9 And when the prophet suffereth himself to be deceived, and he speaketh a word: I the Lord have suffered that prophet to be deceived: and I will stretch out my hand against him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel. 
\v 10 And they shall bear their guilt: as the guilt of the inquirer is, so shall the guilt of the prophet be; 
\v 11 In order that the house of Israel may go no more astray by not following me, and not pollute themselves any more with all their transgressions; but that they may become unto me a people, and I may be unto them a God, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\v 12 And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
\v 13 Son of man, if a land should sin against me by trespassing grievously, and I stretch out my hand against it, and break unto it the staff of bread, and send out famine against it, and cut off from it man and beast; 
\v 14 And if there be these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, in the midst of it: these through their righteousness should save but their own soul; saith the Lord Eternal. 
\v 15 If I cause wild beasts to pass through the land, and they depopulate it, and it becometh desolate, without any one to pass through because of the beasts: 
\v 16 These three men [if they were] in it, as I live, saith the Lord Eternal, should not save either sons or daughters: they only should be saved, but the land should be made desolate. 
\v 17 Or, if I should bring a sword over that land, and say, The sword shall pass through the land, and I cut off from it man and beast; 
\v 18 And if these three men should be in it: as I live, saith the Lord Eternal, they should not save either sons or daughters, but they alone should be saved. 
\v 19 Or, if I should send out the pestilence against that land, and pour out my fury over it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast; 
\v 20 And if Noah, Daniel, and Job, should be in the midst of it: as I live, saith the Lord Eternal, they should not save either son or daughter; they through their righteousness should save their own soul. 
\v 21 For thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Although I send my four dreadful means of punishment over Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the wild beasts, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast: 
\v 22 Still, behold, there are left therein some that escape who shall be carried forth, both sons and daughters; behold, they are coming forth unto you, and ye will see their way and their doings; and then will ye be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, yea, concerning all that I have brought upon it; 
\v 23 And they will comfort you, when ye see their way and their doings; and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have executed in it, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1 And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
\v 2 Son of man, What shall become of the wood of the vine more than of any other wood, of the branch which was standing among the trees of the forest? 
\v 3 Can wood be taken therefrom to employ it for any work? or will men take from it a pin to hang thereon any vessel? 
\v 4 Behold, if it be given up to the fire to be consumed,—[and] the fire have consumed both its ends, and the middle of it be scorched; will it be fit for any work? 
\v 5 Behold, when it was yet entire, it could not be employed for any work: how much more [must this be] when the fire hath consumed it, and it is scorched,—and shall it yet be employed for any work? 
\v 6 Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, As the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given up to the fire to be consumed: so do I give up the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
\v 7 And I will set my face against them: from the fire have they gone forth, yet the fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I set my face against them. 
\v 8 And I will render the land a desert; because they have committed a trespass, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\c 16  
\p
\v 1 And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
\v 2 Son of man, make known unto Jerusalem her abominations, 
\v 3 And thou shalt say, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal unto Jerusalem, Thy origin and thy birth are out of the land of Canaan: thy father was an Emorite, and thy mother a Hittite. 
\v 4 And as for thy birth, on the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut, nor wast thou washed in water to he cleansed; and thou wast not rubbed with salt, nor wrapt in swaddling clothes. 
\v 5 No eye looked with pity on thee, to do any of these things unto thee, to have compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out on the open field, with a loathing of thy body, on the day that thou wast born. 
\v 6 But I passed then by thee, and I saw thee stained with thy own blood, and I said unto thee, In thy blood, live; yea, I said unto thee, In thy blood, live. 
\v 7 Myriads, like the vegetation of the field, did I make of thee, and thou didst increase and become great, and thou attainedst the highest attractions: with thy breasts developed, and thy hair full grown; but thou wast still naked and bare. 
\v 8 But I passed then by thee, and saw thee, and, behold, thy time was the time of love; and I spread the skirt of my garment over thee, and covered thy nakedness: yea, I swore unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord Eternal, and thou becamest mine. 
\v 9 Then did I bathe thee with water, yea, I thoroughly washed away thy blood from thee; and I anointed thee with oil. 
\v 10 I clothed thee also with broidered work, and made thee shoes of badger's skin, and I placed on thy head a turban of fine linen, and I covered thee with silk. 
\v 11 And I decked thee with ornaments, and I placed bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain around thy neck. 
\v 12 And I placed a ring on thy nose, and earrings in thy ears, and a crown of splendor on thy head. 
\v 13 Thus wast thou ornamented with gold and silver; and thy garments were of fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; fine flour, and honey, and oil didst thou eat: and thou wast exceedingly beautiful, and thou didst succeed to acquire dominion. 
\v 14 And thy fame went forth among the nations because of thy beauty; for it was perfect through my glorious ornament, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\v 15 But thou didst trust in thy beauty, and play the harlot because of thy fame, and lavish thy lewd caresses on every one that passed by—on him they were bestowed. 
\v 16 And thou didst take from thy garments, and deck thee high-places with divers colors, and play the harlot thereupon: never should the like come to pass, and never should it be so. 
\v 17 And thou didst take thy elegant ornaments of my gold and of my silver, which I had given thee, and make for thyself male images, and play the harlot with them; 
\v 18 And thou didst take thy broidered garments, and cover them: and my oil and my incense didst thou place before them. 
\v 19 And my bread which I had given thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey, which I had let thee eat, even this didst thou set before them for a sweet savour: yes, so was it, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\v 20 And thou didst take thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hadst born unto me, and didst slaughter these unto them to be devoured; [but] were thy acts of lewdness not yet enough? 
\v 21 That thou didst slay my children, and give them up to cause them to pass through the fire for them? 
\v 22 And in all thy abominations and thy acts of lewdness thou didst not remember the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, when thou wast stained with thy blood. 
\v 23 And it came to pass after all thy wickedness,—[woe, woe unto thee! saith the Lord Eternal;]— 
\v 24 That thou didst build unto thyself eminences, and make thyself elevations in every street. 
\v 25 On the corner of every road didst thou build thy elevations, and make thy beauty abominable, and spread out thy feet to every one that passed by, and multiply thy acts of lewdness. 
\v 26 And thou didst play the harlot with the Egyptians, thy neighbors, with large limbs, and multiply thy acts of lewdness, to provoke me to anger. 
\v 27 And, behold, I stretched out my hand over thee, and diminished thy stated portion; and I gave thee up unto the will of those that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, who were made to blush for thy incestuous course. 
\v 28 Then didst thou play the harlot with the sons of Asshur, because thou wast unsatiable: yea, thou didst play the harlot with them, and wast even then not satisfied. 
\v 29 And thou didst multiply thy lewdness with the traders' land as far as Chaldea; and even with this wast thou not satisfied. 
\v 30 How very corrupt is thy heart, saith the Lord Eternal, seeing thou didst all these things, deeds of an abandoned lewd woman; 
\v 31 Seeing that thou didst build thy eminences at the corner of every road, and make thy elevations in every street; and wast not like a harlot, as thou scornedst the wages. 
\v 32 O thou adulterous wife! who, while bound to her husband, receiveth strangers! 
\v 33 Unto all harlots they give presents; but thou hast given thy presents to all thy lovers, and hast bribed them, that they might come unto thee from every side in thy acts of lewdness. 
\v 34 And the reverse was the case with thee from [other] women in thy acts of lewdness, that men did not follow thee to seek thy lewd caresses; and because thou gavest the wages, and no wages were given thee: so was it the reverse with thee. 
\v 35 Therefore, O harlot, hear the word of the Lord! 
\v 36 Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Whereas thy wealth was squandered, and thy nakedness was uncovered through thy lewd acts with thy lovers, and with all thy abominable idols, and for the blood of thy children, whom thou didst give unto them: 
\v 37 Therefore, behold, I will gather all thy lovers, whom thou hast given pleasure, and all whom thou hast loved, together with all whom thou hast hated,—yea, I will gather them all round about thee, and will uncover thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all thy nakedness. 
\v 38 And I will judge thee, as adulteresses and women that shed blood are judged; and I will bring upon thee the blood of fury and jealousy. 
\v 39 And I will also give thee up into their hand, and they shall pull down thy eminences, and shall break down thy elevations; and they shall strip thee of thy clothes, and they shall take thy elegant ornaments, and leave thee naked and bare. 
\v 40 And they shall bring up against thee an assembly, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords; 
\v 41 And they shall burn thy houses with fire, and execute punishments on thee before the eyes of many women: and I will cause thee to cease from being a harlot, and also the wages [of sin] shalt thou not give any more. 
\v 42 And then will I assuage my fury on thee, and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry. 
\v 43 Because that thou didst not remember the days of thy youth, but didst irritate me with all these things: behold, therefore I also will bring thy course upon thy head, saith the Lord Eternal, and thou shalt no more commit incest with all thy [other] abominations. 
\v 44 Behold, every one that speaketh in proverbs shall use this proverb against thee, saying, As the mother is, so is her daughter. 
\v 45 Thou art thy mother's daughter, loathing her husband and her children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, who have loathed their husbands and their children: your mother was a Hittite, and your father an Emorite. 
\v 46 And thy elder sister is Samaria, she with her daughters, that dwelleth at thy left hand, and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, is Sodom with her daughters. 
\v 47 Yet not even in their ways didst thou walk, nor act according to their abominations: as though this were quite too little, and thou wast more corrupt than they in all thy ways. 
\v 48 As I live, saith the Lord Eternal, Sodom thy sister, she with her daughters, hath not done as thou hast done, thou with thy daughters. 
\v 49 Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom: Pride, abundance of food, and prosperous security were hers and her daughters'; but the hand of the poor and needy did she not strengthen. 
\v 50 And they became haughty, and committed abominations before me: therefore did I remove them when I saw their course. 
\v 51 And Samaria hath not committed even the half of thy sins; but thou didst multiply thy abominations more than they; and thou hast justified thy sisters through all thy abominations which thou hast done. 
\v 52 Bear then thou also thy own confusion, which thou didst adjudge unto each of thy sisters; through thy sins, which thou hast committed more abominably than they, are they made more righteous than thou: therefore thou also—be ashamed, and bear thy confusion, since thou hast justified thy sisters. 
\v 53 And I will bring back again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, and the captivity of the captives in the midst of them: 
\v 54 In order that thou mayest bear thy confusion, and mayest be confounded because of all that thou hast done, when thou art a comfort unto them. 
\v 55 And thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former state, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former state, and thou and thy daughters shall return to your former state. 
\v 56 And was not thy sister Sodom a report in thy mouth in the days of thy pride, 
\v 57 Before yet thy wickedness was discovered, as at the time of the reproach of the daughters of Syria, and all those round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, who taunted thee on all sides? 
\v 58 Thy incest and thy abominations,—thou thyself hadst to bear them, saith the Lord. 
\v 59 For thus hath said the Lord Eternal, I will even deal with thee as thou hast done, thou who hast despised the oath by breaking the covenant. 
\v 60 Nevertheless will I indeed remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant. 
\v 61 And thou shalt then remember thy ways, and be confounded, when thou receivest thy sisters, both those that are older than thou and younger than thou: and I will give them unto thee for daughters, though not because thou wast faithful to the covenant. 
\v 62 And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord: 
\v 63 In order that thou mayest remember, and feel ashamed, and never open thy mouth any more because of thy confusion, when I forgive thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord Eternal.

\v 1 And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
\v 2 Son of man, put forth a riddle, and propound a parable unto the house of Israel; 
\v 3 And say, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, The great eagle with large wings, long winged, full of feathers, who is rich in many colors, came unto the Lebanon, and took the highest branch of the cedar: 
\v 4 The topmost of its young twigs did he crop off, and carry it into the traders' land; and he set it in a city of merchants. 
\v 5 And he took some of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful field: he placed it by great waters, he transplanted it among the willow-trees. 
\v 6 And it grew, and became a trailing vine of low stature, the tendrils of which should turn toward him, and the roots of which should be under him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and sent out shoots. 
\v 7 There was also another great eagle with large wings and many feathers: and, behold, this vine did bend its roots famishing toward him, and shot forth its tendrils toward him, that he might water it, from the beds where it was planted; 
\v 8 [Although] it was planted in a good field by great waters, that it might produce boughs, and that it might bear fruit, that it might become an elegant vine. 
\v 9 Say now, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Shall it prosper? Behold the other will pull up its roots, and its fruit will he cut away, that it may dry up; every one of its growing leaves shall dry up; and not with great power and numerous people [will he have to come] to tear it away from its roots. 
\v 10 Yea, behold, although it is planted, shall it prosper? Lo, as soon as the east wind toucheth it, shall it be utterly dried up: in the beds where it groweth shall it dry up. 
\v 11 And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
\v 12 Do now say to the rebellious family, Know ye not what these things mean? Say, Behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and took away its king and its princes, and he brought them unto himself to Babylon; 
\v 13 And he took one of the royal seed, and made a covenant with him, and bound him with an oath; but the mighty of the land did he take away; 
\v 14 That the kingdom should be debased, so as not to lift itself up; that it should keep his covenant that it might continue to exist. 
\v 15 But he rebelled against him by sending his messengers into Egypt, that they might give him horses and numerous people. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that doth such things? yea, he hath broken the covenant, and shall he escape? 
\v 16 As I live, saith the Lord Eternal, surely in the residence of the king that hath made him king, whose oath he hath despised, and whose covenant he hath broken, even near him in the midst of Babylon shall he die. 
\v 17 And not with a mighty army and a large assembly shall Pharaoh labor for him in the war, when [the other] casteth up mounds, and buildeth works of attack, to cut off many souls. 
\v 18 Yea, he that hath despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when, lo, he had given his hand, and hath done all these things, shall not escape. 
\v 19 Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, As I live, surely my oath that he hath despised, and my covenant that he hath broken,—even this will I bring upon his own head. 
\v 20 And I will spread my net over him, and he shall be caught in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will hold judgment with him there for his trespass which he hath committed against me. 
\v 21 And all his fugitives with all the wings of his army shall fall by the sword, and those that remain shall be dispersed toward all winds: and ye shall know that I the Lord have spoken it. 
\v 22 Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, But I myself will take [a part] of the highest branch of the high cedar, and will preserve it; from the topmost of its young twigs will I crop off a tender one, and I myself will plant it firmly upon a high and eminent mountain: 
\v 23 On the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it firmly; and it shall produce boughs, and bear fruit, and become an elegant cedar; and there shall dwell under it all fowls, every thing that hath wing; in the shadow of its light branches shall they dwell. 
\v 24 And all the trees of the field shall know that I the Lord have made low the high tree, have made high the lowly tree, that I have dried up the green tree, and have caused to flourish the dry tree: I the Lord have spoken and have done it. 
\c 18  
\p
\v 1 And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
\v 2 What mean ye, that ye use this proverb in the country of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the teeth of the children are set on edge? 
\v 3 As I live, saith the Lord Eternal, ye shall not have any more to use this proverb in Israel. 
\v 4 Behold, all the souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son—mine are they: the soul which sinneth that alone shall die. 
\v 5 But if a man be righteous, and execute justice and righteousness; 
\v 6 Upon the mountains he eateth not, and his eyes he lifteth not up to the idols of the house of Israel, and the wife of his neighbor he defileth not, and unto a woman in her separation he cometh not near; 
\v 7 And he over-reacheth no man, he restoreth his pledge for a debt, a robbery he doth not commit, his bread he giveth to the hungry, and the naked he covereth with a garment; 
\v 8 Upon interest he giveth not forth, and increase he doth not take, from wrong he withdraweth his hand, true judgment he executeth between man and man; 
\v 9 In my statutes he walketh steadfastly, and my ordinances he keepeth to deal truly: he is righteous, he shall surely live, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\v 10 If he [now] beget a dissolute son that sheddeth blood and doth to [his] brother any one of thee things; 
\v 11 And he is one that doth not any of these [duties]; but eateth even upon the mountains, and defileth the wife of his neighbor; 
\v 12 The poor and needy he over-reacheth, he is guilty of robberies, the pledge he restoreth not, and to the idols he lifteth up his eyes, abominations he committeth: 
\v 13 Upon interest he giveth forth, and increase he taketh: and he should live? he shall not live; all these abominations hath he done, he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him. 
\v 14 And behold, if he beget a son, who seeth all the sins of his father which he hath done, and he considereth, and doth not the like of them; 
\v 15 Upon the mountains he eateth not, and his eyes he lifteth not up to the idols of the house of Israel, the wife of his neighbor he defileth not; 
\v 16 And he over-reacheth no man, a pledge he withholdeth not, and of a robbery he is never guilty, his bread he giveth to the hungry, and the naked he covereth with a garment; 
\v 17 From the poor he withdraweth his hand, interest and increase he taketh not: my ordinances he executeth; in my statutes he walketh:—he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall surely live. 
\v 18 His father, because he unjustly withheld [wages], was guilty of robbery on his brother, and did that which is not good in the midst of his people,—and lo, he died through his iniquity. 
\v 19 Yet say ye, Why doth not the son bear part of the iniquity of the father? when the son hath executed justice and righteousness, all my statutes hath he kept, and hath done them: he shall surely live. 
\v 20 The soul that sinneth, she alone shall die; the son shall not help to bear the iniquity of the father and the father shall not help to bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him. 
\v 21 And the wicked, when he turneth away from all his sins that he hath committed, and keepeth all my statutes, and executeth justice and righteousness, shall surely live, he shall not die. 
\v 22 All his transgressions which he hath committed shall not be remembered unto him: through his righteousness which he hath done shall he live. 
\v 23 Have I then the least pleasure in the death of the wicked? saith the Lord Eternal: and not in his turning away from his ways, that he may live? 
\v 24 But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth wrong, and doth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live? all his righteousness that he hath done shall not he remembered: through his trespass which he hath committed, and through his sin that he hath done,—through them shall he die. 
\v 25 Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equitable: hear now, O house of Israel, Is not my way equitable? is it not your ways which are not equitable? 
\v 26 When a righteous man turneth away from his righteousness, and doth wrong, and dieth therefore: through his wrong which he hath done must he die. 
\v 27 Again, when the wicked turneth away from his wickedness which he hath committed, and executeth justice and righteousness: he shall indeed preserve his soul alive. 
\v 28 Because he hath considered, and turned away from all his transgressions which he had committed: he shall surely live, he shall not die. 
\v 29 Yet say the house of Israel, The way of the Lord is not equitable: are not my ways equitable, O house of Israel? is it not your ways which are not equitable? 
\v 30 Therefore will I judge you, every one according to his ways, O house of Israel, saith the Lord Eternal: return ye, and cause others to return from all your transgressions, that iniquity may not become your stumbling-block. 
\v 31 Cast away from yourselves all your transgressions, whereby ye have transgressed; and make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit; for why will ye die, O house of Israel? 
\v 32 For I have no pleasure in the death of him that deserveth to die, saith the Lord Eternal: therefore convert yourselves, and live. 
\c 19  
\p
\v 1 And thou,—do thou lift up a lamentation for the princes of Israel, 
\v 2 And say, What a noble lioness was thy mother! among lions did she lie down, in the midst of young lions did she raise her whelps! 
\v 3 And she brought up one of her whelps: he became a young lion, and he learned to tear in pieces the prey; [even] men he devoured. 
\v 4 And when nations heard of him, he was caught in their pit, and they brought him with nose-rings unto the land of Egypt. 
\v 5 Now when she saw that she had long waited, [that] her hope was lost, she took another one of her whelps, and made him a young lion. 
\v 6 And he went up and down in the midst of lions, he became a young lion; and he learned to tear in pieces the prey; even men he devoured. 
\v 7 And he broke down their palaces, and their cities laid he in ruins: and then was terrified the land, with all that filled it, because of the noise of his roaring. 
\v 8 Then set themselves the nations against him on every side from the provinces; and they spread over him their net: in their pit was he caught. 
\v 9 And they put him in a cage with nose-rings [in his nose], and they brought him to the king of Babylon: they brought him into strong-holds, in order that his voice should no more be heard on the mountains of Israel. 
\v 10 Thy mother was like a vine, if I compare thee to aught, planted by the waters: fruitful and full of boughs was she by reason of many waters. 
\v 11 And she had strong branches [fit] for the sceptres of rulers, and her stature grew up high between the thick-branched [trees], and she was seen through her height by means of the multitude of her tendrils. 
\v 12 But she was plucked up in fury, to the ground was she cast down, and the east wind dried up her fruit: and torn off and dried up were her strong branches, a fire consumed them. 
\v 13 And now is she planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty land. 
\v 14 And fire is gone out of a branch of her boughs, and hath devoured her fruit, so that there is no more on her a strong branch for a sceptre to rule. This is a lamentation, and it is become a lamentation. 
\c 20  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, that certain men of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the Lord, and they sat down before me. 
\v 2 And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
\v 3 Son of man, speak unto the elders of Israel, and say unto them, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Is it to inquire of me that ye are coming? as I live, I will not let myself be inquired of by you, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\v 4 Wilt thou take them to task, wilt thou take them to task, son of man? then cause them to know the abominations of their fathers; 
\v 5 And say unto them, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, On the day when I made choice of Israel, I lifted up my hand unto the seed of the house of Jacob, and I made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt: and I lifted up my hand unto them, saying, I am the Lord your God. 
\v 6 On the same day I lifted up my hand unto them, to bring them forth from the land of Egypt into a land that I had selected for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is an ornament among all the countries. 
\v 7 And I said unto them, Cast ye away every one of the abominations of his eyes, and on the idols of Egypt shall ye not defile yourselves: I am the Lord your God. 
\v 8 But they rebelled against me, and they would not hearken unto me; they did not cast away every one the abominations of their eyes, and the idols of Egypt did they not forsake: and I thought then to pour out my fury over them, to let out all my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt. 
\v 9 But I acted for the sake of my name, so as not to profane it before the eyes of the nations, in the midst of whom they were; because I had made myself known unto them before their eyes, to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt. 
\v 10 I therefore caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness. 
\v 11 And I gave them my statutes, and my ordinances made I known to them, which a man is to do, that he may live through them. 
\v 12 And also my sabbaths gave I unto them, to be as a sign between me and between them, that they might know that I am the Lord who sanctify them. 
\v 13 But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness; in my statutes they walked not, and my ordinances they despised, which a man is to do, that he may live through them; and my sabbaths they greatly profaned: and I then thought to pour out my fury over them in the wilderness, to make an end of them. 
\v 14 But I acted for the sake of my name, so as not to profane it before the eyes of the nations, before whose eyes I had brought them forth. 
\v 15 Yet did I also lift up my hand unto them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given [them], flowing with milk and honey, which is an ornament among all the countries. 
\v 16 Because my ordinances they had despised, and in my statutes they had not walked, and my sabbaths they had profaned; for after their idols did their heart go. 
\v 17 Nevertheless my eye looked pityingly on them, so as not to destroy them, and I did not make an end of them in the wilderness. 
\v 18 And I said unto their children in the wilderness, In the statutes of your fathers shall ye not walk, and their ordinances shall ye not keep, and on their idols shall ye not defile yourselves. 
\v 19 I am the Lord your God: in my statutes must ye walk, and my ordinances must ye keep, and do them; 
\v 20 And my sabbaths must ye sanctify; and they shall be as a sign between me and between you, that ye may know that I am the Lord your God. 
\v 21 Nevertheless the children rebelled against me; in my statutes did they not walk, and my ordinances they kept not to do them, which a man is to do, that he may live through them; my sabbaths they profaned: and I then thought to pour out my fury over them, to let out all my anger against them in the wilderness. 
\v 22 But I withdrew my hand, and acted for the sake of my name, so as not to profane it before the eyes of the nations, before whose eyes I had brought them forth. 
\v 23 I also lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the nations, and disperse them through the countries; 
\v 24 Because my ordinances they had not executed, and my statutes they had despised, and my sabbaths they had profaned, and after the idols of their fathers their eyes were directed. 
\v 25 And I also let them follow statutes that were not good, and ordinances whereby they could not live; 
\v 26 And I let them be defiled through their gifts, in that they caused to pass [through the fire] all that openeth the womb, in order that I might destroy them, to the end that they might know that I am the Lord. 
\v 27 Therefore, speak unto the house of Israel, O son of man, and say unto them, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Yet in this too did your fathers blaspheme me, by their committing a trespass against me: 
\v 28 When I had brought them into the land, for which I had lifted up my hand to give it to them, they saw every high hill, and all the thick-branched trees, and they offered there their sacrifices, and presented there their provoking offerings, and they brought there their sweet savor, and poured out there their drink-offerings. 
\v 29 Then said I unto them, What is this high-place whereunto ye go? And its name was called “The height” until this day. 
\v 30 Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Ha! do you pollute yourselves after the manner of your fathers; and after their abominations do ye go astray? 
\v 31 And when ye offer up your gifts, when ye make your sons pass through the fire, ye pollute yourselves with all your idols, even until this day: and I should allow myself to be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, saith the Lord Eternal, I will not let myself be inquired of by you. 
\v 32 And that which cometh up into your mind shall not at all come to pass, [namely,] that ye say, We will be like the nations, like the families of the [other] countries, to serve wood and stone. 
\v 33 As I live, saith the Lord Eternal, surely, with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with fury poured out, will I rule over you: 
\v 34 And I will bring you out from the people, and I will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with [my] fury poured out. 
\v 35 And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and I will hold judgment over you there, face to face. 
\v 36 As I held judgment over your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I hold judgment over you, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\v 37 And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant; 
\v 38 And I will separate from you those that have rebelled, and those that have transgressed against me: out of the country where they sojourn will I cause them to go forth, but into the land of Israel shall not one [of them] enter; and ye shall know that I am the Lord. 
\v 39 As for you, O house of Israel, thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Go ye, serve ye every one his idols, and hereafter [also], if ye will not hearken unto me; but my holy name do not profane any more with your gifts, and with your idols. 
\v 40 For on my holy mountain, on the mountain of the height of Israel, saith the Lord Eternal, there shall serve me all the house of Israel, altogether, in the land: there will I accept them in favor, and there will I require your heave-offerings, and the first-fruits of your oblations, with all your holy things. 
\v 41 With your sweet savor will I accept you in favor, when I bring you out from the people, and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered: and I will be sanctified through you before the eyes of the nations. 
\v 42 And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I bring you into the land of Israel, into the country for which I have lifted up my hand to give it to your fathers. 
\v 43 And ye shall remember there your ways, and all your doings, whereby ye have been defiled; and ye shall loathe yourselves, because of all your evil deeds that ye have committed. 
\v 44 And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I deal with you for the sake of my name, not in accordance with your wicked ways, and in accordance with your corrupt doings, O ye house of Israel, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\v 45 (21:1) And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
\v 46 (21:2) Son of man, set thy face in the direction toward the south, and preach toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the field in the south. 
\v 47 (21:3) And say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the Lord, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall devour in thee every green tree, and every dry tree: the glowing flame shall not be quenched, and there shall be burnt therein all faces from the south to the north. 
\v 48 (21:4) And all flesh shall see that I the Lord have kindled it: it shall not be quenched. 
\v 49 (21:5) Then said I, Ah Lord Eternal! they say of me, Behold, he speaketh but in parables! 
\c 21  
\p
\v 1 (21:6) And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
\v 2 (21:7) Son of man, direct thy face toward Jerusalem, and preach toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel, 
\v 3 (21:8) And say to the land of Israel, Thus hath said the Lord, Behold, I will be against thee, and will draw forth my sword out of its sheath; and I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked. 
\v 4 (21:9) But because I shall have cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked: therefore shall my sword go forth out of its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north; 
\v 5 (21:10) That all flesh may know that I the Lord have drawn forth my sword out of its sheath; it shall not return any more. 
\v 6 (21:11) But thou, son of man, do thou sigh: as though with broken loins, and with bitterness [of grief] shalt thou sigh before their eyes. 
\v 7 (21:12) And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou? that thou shalt say, For the report, because it cometh, when every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be made feeble, and every spirit shall become faint, and all knees shall be changed into water: behold, it cometh, and shall be brought to pass, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\v 8 (21:13) And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
\v 9 (21:14) Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus hath said the Lord, Say, The sword, the sword is sharpened, and also polished; 
\v 10 (21:15) In order to make a thorough slaughter is it sharpened; in order that it may glitter is it polished: how can we now rejoice, [when] the rod which reacheth my son excelleth in hardness every tree? 
\v 11 (21:16) And he hath given it to be polished, to make it fit to grasp it in the hand: it is the sword which is sharpened, and it is polished, to place it into the hand of the slayer. 
\v 12 (21:17) Cry aloud and wail, O son of man; for it cometh against my people, it cometh against all the princes of Israel; brought together for the sword are they with my people: therefore strike [thy hand] upon thy thigh. 
\v 13 (21:18) For a purification taketh place: and what if the irresistible rod will also come? [my son] would not be able to exist, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\v 14 (21:19) But thou, son of man, prophesy, and strike thy hands together, and let “The sword” be repeated the third time, the sword of the slain: it is the sword of the great that are slain, which lieth in wait for them everywhere. 
\v 15 (21:20) In order to make timid the heart, and to multiply the stumbling-blocks, do I bring the howling of the sword against all their gates: ah! it is made bright, it is made thin-edged for the slaughter. 
\v 16 (21:21) Gather up thy strength, go to the right hand, direct thyself, go to the left, whithersoever thy edge is turned. 
\v 17 (21:22) And I also,—I will strike my hands together, and I will cause my fury to be assuaged: I the Lord have spoken it. 
\v 18 (21:23) And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
\v 19 (21:24) But thou, O son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come; out of one land shall both of them come forth: and select a place; at the head of the way to a city do thou select it. 
\v 20 (21:25) A way shalt thou appoint, that the sword may come against Rabbah of the children of 'Ammon, and [the other] against Judah [dwelling] in Jerusalem the fortified. 
\v 21 (21:26) For the king of Babylon hath halted at the parting of the way, at the commencement of the two ways, to use divination: he shaketh the arrows, he consulteth with images, he looketh at the liver. 
\v 22 (21:27) At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to erect battering-rams, to open the mouth with the [cry for] murder, to lift up the voice with shouting, to place battering-rams against the gates, to cast up a mound, and to build works of attack. 
\v 23 (21:28) And it will appear unto them as a false divination in their eyes, to those that had sworn oaths; but he will bring to remembrance their iniquity, that they may be caught. 
\v 24 (21:29) Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Because ye have brought your iniquity to remembrance, as your transgressions are discovered, so that your sins do appear in all your doings: because ye are thus brought to remembrance, ye shall be caught by [his] hand. 
\v 25 (21:30) And thou, death-deserving wicked one, prince of Israel, whose day is come, at the time of the iniquity of the end,— 
\v 26 (21:31) Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Remove the mitre, and take off the crown: this shall not be always so; exalt him that is low, and make him low that is high. 
\v 27 (21:32) Overthrown, overthrown, overthrown will I render it: also this shall not belong [to any one], until he come whose right it is, and I will give it him. 
\v 28 (21:33) And thou, son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal concerning the children of 'Ammon, and concerning their reproach: even say thou, The sword, the sword is drawn; for the slaughter is it polished, to destroy, that it may continue to glitter; 
\v 29 (21:34) While they foresee unto thee falsehood, while they divine unto thee lies, to lay thee by the necks of the slain wicked, whose day is come, at the time of the iniquity of the end. 
\v 30 (21:35) Put back [the sword] into its sheath! in the place where thou wast created, in the land of thy origin, will I judge thee. 
\v 31 (21:36) And I will pour out over thee my indignation, with the fire of my wrath will I blow against thee, and I will give thee up into the hand of brutish men, skilful in destroying. 
\v 32 (21:37) To the fire shalt thou be given to be devoured; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land: thou shalt not be remembered [any more]; for I the Lord have spoken it.

\v 1 And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
\v 2 And thou, son of man, wilt thou take to task, wilt thou take to task the city of blood? and wilt thou make her know all her abominations? 
\v 3 Then say thou, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, O city that sheddeth blood in her midst, that her time [of sorrow] may come, and that hath made idols for herself to become unclean: 
\v 4 Through thy blood which thou hast shed, are thou become guilty; and through thy idols which thou hast made art thou become unclean; and thou hast caused thy days [of destruction] to draw near, and thou art come even unto thy years; therefore do I make thee a disgrace unto the nations, and a mocking to all the countries. 
\v 5 Those who are near, and those who are far from thee, shall mock thee, O thou unclean in name, and great in confusion! 
\v 6 Behold, the princes of Israel were each [ready] with his arm within thee, in order to shed blood. 
\v 7 Father and mother they esteemed lightly within thee, toward the stranger they acted with extortion in the midst of thee, the fatherless and the widow they oppressed within thee. 
\v 8 My holy things thou didst despise, and my sabbaths thou didst profane. 
\v 9 Tale-bearers [also] were within thee, in order to shed blood; and upon the mountains did they eat within thee; incest did they commit in the midst of thee. 
\v 10 Their father's nakedness they uncovered within thee; her that was unclean in her separation did they violate within thee. 
\v 11 And one with his neighbor's wife did commit abomination; and another did defile his daughter-in-law with incest; and another did violate his sister, the daughter of his father, within thee. 
\v 12 Bribes they took within thee, in order to shed blood; interest and increase didst thou take, and thou didst acquire gain off thy neighbors by extortion: and me thou didst forget, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\v 13 And behold, I have struck my hands together at thy wrongful gain which thou hast acquired, and at thy blood-guilt which hath been in the midst of thee. 
\v 14 Will thy courage endure, or will thy hands remain strong, on the days that I will deal with thee? I the Lord have spoken, and will do it. 
\v 15 And I will scatter thee among the nations, and disperse thee in the countries, and I will entirely remove thy uncleanness out of thee. 
\v 16 And thou shalt be degraded through thyself before the eyes of nations, and thou shalt know that I am the Lord. 
\v 17 And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
\v 18 Son of man, the house of Israel are become to me dross: they all are copper, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; the dross of silver are they become. 
\v 19 Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Because ye are all become dross, therefore, behold, I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem. 
\v 20 As silver, and copper, and iron, and lead, and tin are gathered into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt it: so will I gather you in my anger and in my fury and I will lay you down there, and melt you. 
\v 21 Yea, I will assemble you in a heap, and blow upon you with the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst of it. 
\v 22 As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst of it: and ye shall know that I am the Lord who have poured out my fury over you. 
\v 23 And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
\v 24 Son of man, say unto her, Thou art a land that is not cleansed; [and] which is not rained upon on the day of indignation. 
\v 25 The banded troop of her prophets in the midst of her is like a roaring lion that teareth in pieces the prey: souls do they devour; wealth and precious things do they take away; the number of her widows do they increase in the midst of her. 
\v 26 Her priests violate my law, and profane my holy things: between the holy and profane do they make no distinction, and the difference between the unclean and the clean do they not make known, and from [the violation of] my sabbaths do they turn away their eyes, so that I am profaned among them. 
\v 27 Her princes in her midst are like wolves that tear in pieces the prey, to shed blood, to destroy souls, in order to obtain selfish gain. 
\v 28 And her prophets plastered for them with unadhesive mortar, foreseeing falsehood, and divining unto them lies, saying, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal; when the Lord had not spoken. 
\v 29 The people of the land are guilty of extortion, and practise robbery, and the poor and the needy they defraud: and they extort from the stranger with injustice. 
\v 30 And I seek now among them for a man, that could erect a fence, and stand in the breach before me in behalf of the land, so that I should not destroy it; but I find none. 
\v 31 And I therefore pour out over them my indignation; with the fire of my wrath do I make an end of them: their own way do I bring upon their head, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\c 23  
\p
\v 1 And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
\v 2 Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother; 
\v 3 And they played the harlot in Egypt; in their youth they played the harlot: there were their breasts pressed, and there they suffered their virgin bosoms to be touched. 
\v 4 And their names were Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister; but they became mine, and they bore sons and daughters: and their names are, Samaria is Aholah, and Jerusalem, Aholibah. 
\v 5 And Aholah played the harlot while she was mine; and she longed for her lovers, for the Assyrians that were near [her], 
\v 6 Clothed [as they were] in blue, governors, and rulers, attractive youths all of them, horsemen riding upon horses. 
\v 7 Thus she played the harlot with them, all of them the chosen ones of the sons of Asshur: and with all for whom she longed,—with all their idols did she defile herself. 
\v 8 But also her lewdness from Egypt forsook she not; for they had lain with her in her youth, and they had touched her virgin bosom, and had lavished their lewd caresses on her. 
\v 9 Therefore did I give her up into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the sons of Asshur, after whom she longed. 
\v 10 These were they that laid open her nakedness; her sons and her daughters did they take away, and her they slew with the sword: and she became infamous among women, when they inflicted the decreed punishments on her. 
\v 11 And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she became more corrupt in her longing than she, and in her lewd acts more than her sister's lewdness. 
\v 12 For the sons of Asshur did she long, the governors and rulers that were near, clothed as they were most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, attractive youths all of them. 
\v 13 Then saw I that she was defiled, that they followed both one way. 
\v 14 But she added still more to her acts of lewdness; for when she saw men engraved upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with color, 
\v 15 Bound with girdles on their loins, with hanging down colored turbans on their heads, in appearance like commanders, all of them, in the likeness of the sons of Babylon of the Chaldeans, the land of their birth: 
\v 16 Then did she long for them as soon as she saw them with her eyes, and she sent messengers unto them to Chaldea. 
\v 17 And the sons of Babylon came to her unto the couch of love, and they defiled her with their lewd caresses; and [yet] when she had been defiled with them, she tore her soul away from them. 
\v 18 And when she had laid open her lewdness, and had uncovered her nakedness: then my soul tore itself away from her, as my soul had torn itself away from her sister. 
\v 19 Yet she multiplied her deeds of lewdness, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, when she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt. 
\v 20 And she longed for her paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose lustfulness is like the lustfulness of horses. 
\v 21 And thou calledst to mind the incest of thy youth, when thy bosom was touched by the Egyptians for the sake of thy youthful breasts. 
\v 22 Therefore, O Aholibah, thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I will wake up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy soul hath torn itself away, and I will bring them against thee from every side; 
\v 23 The sons of Babylon, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa and Koa, and all the sons of Asshur with them, attractive youths, governors and rulers all of them, commanders and chiefs, riding upon horses all of them. 
\v 24 And they shall come over thee with weapons, chariots, and wheels, and with an assembly of people, buckler and shield and helmet shall they set up against thee round about: and I will give up before them the right to judge, and they shall judge thee according to their ordinances. 
\v 25 And I will set my zealousness against thee, and they shall deal with thee in fury; thy nose and thy ears shall they cut off; and what is left of thee shall fall by the sword: thy sons and thy daughters shall they take away; and what is left of thee shall be devoured by the fire. 
\v 26 And they shall strip thee of thy clothes, and take away thy ornamental attire. 
\v 27 Thus will I make thy incest to cease from thee, and thy lewdness brought from the land of Egypt: and thou shalt not lift up thy eyes unto them, and Egypt shalt thou not remember any more. 
\v 28 For thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I will give thee up into the hand of those whom thou hatest, into the hand of those from whom thy soul hath torn itself away; 
\v 29 And they shall deal with thee in hate, and shall take away all [things acquired by] thy labor, and they shall leave thee naked and bare: and thus shall be uncovered the nakedness of thy lewdness, and thy incest and thy lewd deeds. 
\v 30 I will do these things unto thee, because thou hast gone with vile lust after the nations, because thou hast defiled thyself with their idols. 
\v 31 On the way of thy sister hast thou walked; therefore will I place her cup into thy hand. 
\v 32 Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, The cup of thy sister shalt thou drink, the deep and wide one: thou shalt become to be laughed to scorn and to be held in derision, more than thou canst bear. 
\v 33 With drunkenness and sorrow shalt thou be filled, [out of] the cup of astonishment and confusion, the cup of thy sister Samaria. 
\v 34 Thou shalt even drink it and drain it out, and thou shalt break in pieces its fragments, and tear thy own breasts; for I have spoken it, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\v 35 Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back: therefore bear thou also thy incest and thy acts of lewdness. 
\v 36 The Lord said moreover unto me, Son of man, wilt thou call Aholah and Aholibah to account? then tell them of their abominations; 
\v 37 That they have committed adultery, and there is blood on their hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery, and also their sons whom they had born unto me have they caused to pass for them through [the fire], to devour them. 
\v 38 Moreover this have they done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary on the same day, and my sabbaths have they profaned. 
\v 39 And when they had slain their children to their idols, then came they into my sanctuary on the same day to profane it: and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of my house. 
\v 40 And farthermore yet, because they sent for men who were to come from afar, unto whom messengers were sent; and, lo, they came, for whom thou didst bathe thyself, paint thy eyes, and deck thyself with ornaments; 
\v 41 And thou didst sit upon a stately bed, with a table spread before it, and my incense and my oil didst thou set upon it. 
\v 42 And the shout of a peaceful joyous multitude was [heard] within her; and with the men of the masses of the common people were brought Sabeans from the wilderness; and these women placed bracelets on their hands, and crowns of glory upon their heads. 
\v 43 Then thought I of her that was worn out in adulteries, Will they now [still] commit lewdness with her, when she [is thus]? 
\v 44 But men went in unto her, as they go in unto a faithless wife: thus went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah, the incestuous women. 
\v 45 Righteous men, however—these shall judge them as adulteresses are judged, and as women that shed blood are judged; because adulteresses are they, and blood is on their hands. 
\v 46 For thus hath said the Lord Eternal, I will bring up against them an assemblage of men, and I will give them up to ill-usage and plunder. 
\v 47 And the assemblage shall stone them with stones, and cut them down with their swords: their sons and their daughters shall they slay, and their houses shall they burn with fire. 
\v 48 Thus will I cause incest to cease out of the land, that all women may be warned by example, and not do after your incestuous course. 
\v 49 And they shall lay your incest upon you, and the sins of your idols shall ye bear: and ye shall know that I am the Lord Eternal. 
\c 24  
\p
\v 1 And the word of the Lord came unto me in the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, saying, 
\v 2 Son of man, write thee down the name of this day, of this same day: the king of Babylon hath advanced against Jerusalem on this same day. 
\v 3 And speak concerning the rebellious family a parable, and say unto them, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Set on the pot, set it on, and also pour water into it; 
\v 4 Gather the proper pieces into it, every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill it up with the choice bones. 
\v 5 Take the choice of the flock, and make also a fire for the bones under it: cause it to seethe well, that even the bones therein may be fully boiled through. 
\v 6 Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Woe to the city of blood-guiltiness, to the pot the scum of which is yet in it, and the scum of which is not gone out of it! one of its pieces after the other take out from it: no lot is cast for it. 
\v 7 For her blood was in the midst of her; on the naked rock did she place it: she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it over with dust. 
\v 8 To cause my fury to arise to take vengeance, do I place her blood upon the naked rock, so that it shall not be covered up. 
\v 9 Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Woe to the city of blood-guiltiness! I also will myself build up a large burning pile, 
\v 10 Heaping on the wood, kindling the fire, thoroughly boiling the flesh, and stirring the mixture, that the bones may be scorched. 
\v 11 Then will I set it empty upon its coals, in order that it may become hot, and its copper be made to glow, and its uncleanness may be molten in it, that its scum may be consumed. 
\v 12 With fraud hath she wearied [the poor]; therefore shall not go forth from her the greatness of her scum: through fire shall her scum [be removed]. 
\v 13 In thy uncleanness is [thy] incest; because I endeavored to cleanse thee, and thou wouldst not be clean, thou shalt not be cleansed from thy uncleanness any more, until I have assuaged my fury on thee. 
\v 14 I the Lord have spoken it; it cometh to pass, and I will do it; I will not recall my decree, and I will not have pity, nor will I repent: according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall men judge thee, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\v 15 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, 
\v 16 Son of man, behold, I will take away from thee the desire of thy eyes by a sudden death; but thou shalt neither mourn nor weep, nor shalt thou shed a tear. 
\v 17 Sigh in silence, make no mourning for the deceased, thy bonnet bind around thy head, and thy shoes put on thy feet, and cover not thyself to thy upper lip, and eat not the bread of [other] men. 
\v 18 And when I had spoken unto the people in the morning, my wife died at evening: and I did in the morning as I had been commanded. 
\v 19 And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these things mean for us, that thou doest so? 
\v 20 And I said unto them, The word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
\v 21 Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and the darling of your soul: and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left behind shall fall by the sword. 
\v 22 And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover yourselves to your upper lip, and the bread of other men shall ye not eat. 
\v 23 And your bonnets shall be around your heads, and your shoes shall be on your feet: ye shall not mourn nor shall ye weep; but ye shall pine away in your iniquities, and groan, looking one at the other. 
\v 24 Thus shall Ezekiel be unto you for a token; in accordance with all that he hath done shall ye do: when this cometh, then shall ye know that I am the Lord Eternal. 
\v 25 Also, thou son of man, behold, on the day when I take from them their stronghold, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and the coveted object of their soul, their sons and their daughters,— 
\v 26 On that day there shall come one that hath escaped unto thee, and announce it to thy ears. 
\v 27 On that day shall thy mouth be opened through him that hath escaped, and thou shalt speak, and thou shalt not be silenced any more: and thou shalt be a token unto them, and they shall know that I am the Lord. 
\c 25  
\p
\v 1 And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
\v 2 Son of man, set thy face against the sons of 'Ammon, and prophesy against them; 
\v 3 And say unto the sons of 'Ammon, Hear ye the word of the Lord Eternal, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Because thou hast said, Aha, concerning my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and concerning the land of Israel, when it was made desolate; and concerning the house of Judah, when they went into exile: 
\v 4 Therefore, behold, I will give thee up to the children of the east for a possession, and they shall set up their towers in thee, and place in thee their dwellings; they shall indeed eat thy fruit, and they shall surely drink thy milk. 
\v 5 And I will change Rabbah into a pasture for camels, and [the land of] the sons of 'Ammon into a resting-place for flocks: and ye shall know that I am the Lord. 
\v 6 For thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Whereas thou didst clap thy hands, and stamp with thy feet, and rejoice with all thy derision in the soul over the land of Israel: 
\v 7 Therefore, behold, will I stretch out my hand over thee, and will give thee up for a spoil to the nations; and I will cut thee off from the people, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries; I will destroy thee, and thou shalt know that I am the Lord. 
\v 8 Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Because Moab and Se'ir do say, Behold, the house of Judah is like all the nations: 
\v 9 Therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Beth-ha-yeshimoth, Ba'al-me'on, and Kiryathayim, 
\v 10 Unto the children of the east [coming] against the sons of 'Ammon, and I will give them in possession; in order that the sons of 'Ammon may not be remembered among the nations. 
\v 11 And on Moab will I execute judgments: and they shall know that I am the Lord. 
\v 12 Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Because the Edomites have acted revengefully against the house of Judah, and have greatly offended, and have taken vengeance on them: 
\v 13 Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, I will also stretch out my hand against Edom, and cut off from it man and beast; and I will make it a ruined land from Theman; and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword. 
\v 14 And I will display my vengeance on Edom by the hand of my people Israel; and they shall do in Edom according to my anger and according to my fury: and they shall feel my vengeance, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\v 15 Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Because the Philistines have acted in revenge, and have taken vengeance with derision in their soul, to destroy out of ancient enmity: 
\v 16 Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I will stretch out my hand against the Philistines, and I will cut off the Kerethim, and destroy the remnant of the [dwellers] of the sea-coast. 
\v 17 And I will execute on them great vengeances with furious chastisements: and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I display my vengeance on them. 
\c 26  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass in the eleventh year, on the first day of the month, that the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
\v 2 Son of man, because Tyre hath said concerning Jerusalem, Aha, she is broken that was the gates of the people; she is turned unto me; I shall be made full, now she is laid in ruins: 
\v 3 Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I am against thee, O Tyre, and will bring up against thee many nations, as the sea causeth its waves to come up. 
\v 4 And they shall destroy the walls of Tyre, and pull down her towers: I will also flood away her earth from her, and I will change her into a naked rock. 
\v 5 A place for the spreading out of nets shall she be in the midst of the sea; for I have spoken it, saith the Lord Eternal: and she shall become a spoil to the nations. 
\v 6 And her daughters that are in the field shall be slain with the sword: and they shall know that I am the Lord. 
\v 7 For thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I will bring against Tyre Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, from the north, the king of kings, with horses, and with chariot's, and with horsemen, and an assemblage, and a numerous people. 
\v 8 Thy daughters in the field will he slay with the sword: and he shall place around thee works of attack, and cast up against thee a mound, and erect against thee a target-fence. 
\v 9 And his catapults shall he set against thy walls, and thy towers shall he break down with his axes. 
\v 10 By reason of the abundance of his horses shall the dust they raise cover thee: by reason of the noise of horsemen, and wheels, and chariots, shall thy walls quake, when he entereth into thy gates, as men enter into a city that is broken in. 
\v 11 With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets: thy people will he slay with the sword, and the statues of thy strength shall come down to the ground. 
\v 12 And they shall plunder thy riches, and make a spoil of thy merchandise; and they shall break down thy walls, and thy pleasure-houses shall they pull down: and thy stones and thy timber and thy earth shall they throw into the midst of the water. 
\v 13 And I will cause the sound of thy songs to cease: and the tones of thy harps shall not be heard any more. 
\v 14 And I will change thee into a naked rock; a place to spread out nets upon shalt thou be; thou shalt not be rebuilt any more; for I the Lord have spoken it, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\v 15 Thus hath said the Lord Eternal to Tyre, Truly at the noise of thy fall, when the deadly wounded whine, when the slaughter taketh place in the midst of thee, shall the islands quake. 
\v 16 Then shall all the princes of the sea come down from their thrones, and lay aside their robes, and their broidered garments shall they put off: with trembling shall they clothe themselves; upon the ground shall they sit, and shall tremble at every moment, and be astonished concerning thee. 
\v 17 And they shall lift up over thee a lamentation, and say to thee, How art thou lost, that wast inhabited [safely] by reason of the seas: O renowned city, which was strong on the sea, she and her inhabitants, who caused their terror to be on all that dwelt around her! 
\v 18 Now shall the isles tremble on the day of thy fall; yea, the isles that are in the sea shall be troubled at thy end. 
\v 19 For thus hath said the Lord Eternal, When I render thee a ruined city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I bring up over thee the deep, and when the great waters cover thee: 
\v 20 Then will I bring thee down with those that descend into the pit, unto the people of olden time, and I will cause thee to dwell in the land of the nether world, among ruins of ancient days, with those that go down to the pit, in order that thou mayest not be inhabited; but I will bestow glory in the land of life. 
\v 21 As though thou hadst not been will I render thee, and thou shalt be no more: and thou shalt be sought for, but thou shalt never be found any more to eternity, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\c 27  
\p
\v 1 And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
\v 2 But thou, O son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyre; 
\v 3 And say unto Tyre, O thou that art situated at the entrances of the sea, the merchant of the people unto many isles, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, O Tyre, thou hast indeed said, I am perfect in beauty. 
\v 4 In the heart of the seas were thy boundaries, thy builders had perfected thy beauty. 
\v 5 Of the fir-trees from Senir had they built thee all thy woodwork: cedars from Lebanon had they taken to make masts for thee. 
\v 6 Of the oaks of Bashan had they made thy oars; thy rudder had they made inlaid with ivory of boxwood, brought out of the isles of the Kittim. 
\v 7 Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was thy flag to be unto thee a sign: of blue and purple from the isles of Ellishah was thy cover. 
\v 8 The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy oarsmen: thy wise men, O Tyre, that were in thee, these were thy pilots. 
\v 9 The elders of Gebal and her wise men were in thee thy caulkers: all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee to carry on thy commerce. 
\v 10 They of Persia and of Lud and of Put were in thy army, thy men of war: the shield and the helmet did they hang up in thee; these gave thee thy elegance. 
\v 11 The men of Arvad with thy army were upon thy walls round about, and the Gammadim were in thy towers: their quivers they hung upon thy walls round about; these made perfect thy beauty. 
\v 12 Tharshish was thy merchant through the abundance of all kind of wealth: with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they supplied thy markets. 
\v 13 Javan, Thubal, and Meshech; these were thy merchants: with the persons of men and vessels of copper they carried on thy commerce. 
\v 14 They of the family of Thogarmah furnished thy supplies in horses and horsemen and mules. 
\v 15 The men of Dedan were thy merchants; many isles fetched the merchandise from thy place: chamois horns, ivory, and ebony did they bring as presents for thee. 
\v 16 Syria was thy trader by reason of the multitude of thy productions: with emeralds, purple, and broidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and rubies they made deposits in thy treasuries. 
\v 17 Judah, and the land of Israel, these were thy merchants: in wheat of Minnith, and balsam, and honey, and oil, and balm they carried on thy commerce. 
\v 18 Damascus was thy trader in the multitude of thy productions, for the multitude of all wealth, with the wine of Chelbon, and white wool. 
\v 19 Dan also and Javan brought silken goods into thy warehouses: hardened iron, cassia, and calamus came among thy commerce. 
\v 20 Dedan was thy merchant in precious clothes for riding on. 
\v 21 Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, these were the traders of thy place in lambs, and wethers, and he-goats: in these were they thy traders. 
\v 22 The merchants of Sheba and Ra'mah,—these were thy merchants: in the best of all spices, and with all precious stones, and gold, they furnished thy supplies. 
\v 23 Charan, and Canneh, and 'Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, [and] Kilmad, were thy merchants. 
\v 24 These were thy merchants in ornamental wares, in cloaks of blue, and broidered work, and in chests of damask cloth, bound with cords, and packed in cedar, in thy market-place. 
\v 25 The ships of Tharshish were thy caravans in thy commerce: and thou wast made full, and becamest very rich in the heart of the seas. 
\v 26 Into great waters brought thee those that were thy rowers: the east wind hath broken thee in the heart of the seas. 
\v 27 Thy wealth, and thy warehouses, thy commerce, thy mariners, and thy pilots, thy caulkers, and the conductors of thy commerce, and all thy men of war that were in thee, and in all thy assemblage which was in the midst of thee, fell into the heart of the seas on the day of thy downfall. 
\v 28 At the sound of the painful cry of thy pilots quake [thy] rural districts. 
\v 29 And all that handle the oar, the mariners, and all the pilots of the sea, come down from their ships, they stand upon the land; 
\v 30 And cause their voice to be heard concerning thee, and cry bitterly, and cast up dust upon their heads, they wallow in the ashes; 
\v 31 And they make themselves utterly bald for thee, and gird themselves with sackcloth, and they weep for thee with bitterness of heart in a bitter complaint. 
\v 32 And they take in their wailing a lamentation for thee, and lament over thee, saying, Who is like Tyre, who is so utterly destroyed in the midst of the sea? 
\v 33 When thy supplies went forth out of the seas, thou didst satisfy many people: with the multitude of thy wealth and of thy commerce thou didst enrich the kings of the earth. 
\v 34 [Now] at the time thou art broken by the seas in the depths of the waters, thy commerce and all thy assemblage fell in the midst of thee. 
\v 35 All the inhabitants of the isles are astonished at thee, and the hair of their kings stand at an end, grieved are their countenances. 
\v 36 The traders among the people shall hiss concerning thee: thou wast rendered as though thou hadst not been, and thou shalt not be any more for ever. 
\c 28  
\p
\v 1 And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
\v 2 Son of man, say unto the prince of Tyre, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Whereas thy heart was lifted up, and thou saidst, A god am I, on the seat of the gods do I dwell, in the heart of the seas; yet thou art but a man, and not God, while thou esteemest thy mind equal to the mind of God; 
\v 3 Behold, thou wast wiser than Daniel; no secret was obscure to thee; 
\v 4 With thy wisdom and with thy understanding hadst thou gotten thee riches, and hadst gotten gold and silver into thy treasuries; 
\v 5 By the abundance of thy wisdom in thy traffic hadst thou increased thy riches; and thy heart was lifted up because of thy riches: 
\v 6 Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Because thou hast esteemed thy mind equal to the mind of God, 
\v 7 Therefore, behold, will I bring over thee strangers, the fiercest • of nations; and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom, and they shall profane thy elegance. 
\v 8 Down to the grave will they cast thee, and thou shalt die the deaths of the slain in the heart of the seas. 
\v 9 Wilt thou then say, I am God, before him that slayeth thee? when thou art but a man, and no God, in the hand of him that fatally wounded thee. 
\v 10 The deaths of the uncircumcised shalt thou die by the hand of strangers; for I have spoken it, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\v 11 And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
\v 12 Son of man, take up a lamentation concerning the king of Tyre, and say unto him, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Thou wast complete in outline, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty. 
\v 13 In 'Eden the garden of God didst thou abide; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, the topaz, and the diamond, the chrysolite, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold; thy tabrets and thy flutes of artificial workmanship were prepared in thee on the day thou wast created. 
\v 14 Thou wast a cherub with outspread covering [wings]; and I had set thee upon the holy mountain of God [as] thou wast; in the midst of the stones of fire didst thou wander. 
\v 15 Perfect wast thou in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till wickedness was found in thee. 
\v 16 By the abundance of thy commerce thou wast filled to thy centre with violence, and thou didst sin: therefore I degraded thee out of the mountain of God; and I destroyed thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire. 
\v 17 Thy heart was lifted up through thy beauty, thou didst corrupt thy wisdom by reason of thy elegance: [therefore] I cast thee down to the ground, before kings did I set thee that they might gaze on thee. 
\v 18 Through the abundance of thy iniquities, through the wickedness of thy commerce didst thou profane thy sanctuaries: therefore brought I forth fire from the midst of thee, this devoured thee, and I changed thee to ashes upon the earth before the eyes of all those that saw thee. 
\v 19 All that know thee among the people are astonished concerning thee: thou art as though thou hadst not been, and thou shalt not be any more for ever. 
\v 20 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, 
\v 21 Son of man, set thy face against Zidon, and prophesy against it, 
\v 22 And thou shalt say, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I am against thee, O Zidon, and I will be honored in the midst of thee: and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I execute judgments on her, and will be sanctified on her. 
\v 23 And I will send out against her pestilence, and blood-[shedding] into her streets; and the deadly wounded shall be felled in the midst of her by the sword [that is] against her from every side: and they shall know that I am the Lord. 
\v 24 And there shall be no more unto the house of Israel a pricking brier, nor painful thorn from all that are round about them, that despoil them: and they shall know that I am the Lord Eternal. 
\v 25 Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, When I gather the house of Israel from the people among whom they are scattered, and shall be sanctified on them before the eyes of the nations: then shall they dwell in their land that I have given to my servant Jacob. 
\v 26 And they shall dwell thereupon in safety, and they shall build houses, and plant vineyards; yea, they shall dwell in safety; when I execute judgments on all those that despoiled them from round about them: and they shall know that I am the Lord their God. 
\c 29  
\p
\v 1 In the tenth year, in the tenth month, on the twelfth day of the month, came the word of the Lord unto me, saying, 
\v 2 Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt. 
\v 3 Speak and say, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I will be against thee, O Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great crocodile that lieth in the midst of his streams, who hath said, Mine is my stream, and I have made it for myself. 
\v 4 But I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will fasten the fish of thy streams on thy scales; and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy streams, with all the fish of thy streams which shall stick fast on thy scales. 
\v 5 And I will cast thee out into the wilderness, thee with all the fish of thy streams; upon the open field shalt thou fall; thou shalt not be brought in, nor gathered up: to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the heaven have I given thee for food. 
\v 6 And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the Lord; because they have been a reed-staff to the house of Israel. 
\v 7 When they took hold of thee with the hand, thou wast cracked, and didst rend for them all the shoulder: and when they leaned upon thee, thou wast broken, and madest all their loins to be at a stand. 
\v 8 Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I will bring a sword upon thee, and I will cut off out of thee man and beast. 
\v 9 And the land of Egypt shall be changed into a waste and ruin, and they shall know that I am the Lord; because he hath said, The stream is mine, and I have made it. 
\v 10 Therefore, behold, I will be against thee, and against thy streams, and I will render the land of Egypt a mass of ruins, a waste, and a wilderness, from Migdol to Seveneh even up to the border of Ethiopia. 
\v 11 There shall not pass through it the foot of man, and the foot of beast shall not pass through it, and it shall not be inhabited forty years. 
\v 12 And I will render the land of Egypt a desolate land in the midst of desolated countries, and her cities among the cities that are ruined shall be desolate forty years: and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries. 
\v 13 For thus hath said the Lord Eternal, [only] at the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the people whither they shall have been scattered; 
\v 14 And I will bring back the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros, into the land of their own origin: and they shall be there an unimportant kingdom. 
\v 15 Among the kingdoms it shall be the lowest; neither shall it raise itself any more above the nations: and I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations. 
\v 16 And it shall be no more unto the house of Israel for a dependence, bringing [their] iniquity to remembrance, when they turned after them: and they shall know that I am the Lord Eternal. 
\v 17 And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first month, on the first of the month, that the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
\v 18 Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hath caused his army to perform a great service against Tyre; every head hath been made bald, and every shoulder hath been rubbed sore: yet no reward hath come to him or to his army from Tyre, for the service that he hath performed against it. 
\v 19 Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I will give unto Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon the land of Egypt; and he shall carry away its multitude, and take its spoil, and plunder its prey: and this shall be the reward for his army. 
\v 20 As his recompense for that which he hath served against it, have I given him the land of Egypt, for that which they had done against me, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\v 21 On that day will I cause to grow a horn for the house of Israel, and unto thee will I open the mouth in the midst of them: and they shall know that I am the Lord. 
\c 30  
\p
\v 1 And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
\v 2 Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Wail ye, Woe unto the day! 
\v 3 For nigh is the day, yea nigh is the day of the Lord; a cloudy day; the time of the nations' [misfortune] shall it be. 
\v 4 And the sword shall come into Egypt, and there shall be trembling in Ethiopia, when the slain fall in Egypt, and when they take away its multitude, and its foundations shall be broken down. 
\v 5 Ethiopia, and Put, and Lud, and all the confederates, and Cub, and all the men of the leagued land, shall fall with them by the sword. 
\v 6 Thus hath said the Lord, Yea, there shall fall those that uphold Egypt; and there shall come down the pride of her strength: from Migdol to Seveneh shall they fall in her by the sword, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\v 7 And they shall be made desolate in the midst of the desolate countries, and its cities shall be counted in the midst of the cities that have been laid in ruins. 
\v 8 And they shall know that I am the Lord, when I set fire to Egypt, and when all her helpers shall be broken. 
\v 9 On that day shall messengers go forth from my presence in ships to terrify the secure Ethiopians, and there shall be trembling among them, as on the day of Egypt; for, lo, it cometh. 
\v 10 Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, I will also cause the multitude of Egypt to cease through the hand of Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon. 
\v 11 He and his people with him, the fiercest of nations, shall be brought to destroy the land; and they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and they shall fill the land with the slain. 
\v 12 And I will render the streams dry, and sell the land into the hand of evil men; and I will make the land desolate, and all that filleth it, by the hand of strangers: I the Lord have spoken it. 
\v 13 Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, I will also destroy the idols, and I will cause false gods to cease out of Noph; and a prince out of the land of Egypt shall there not be any more: and I will lay fear on the land of Egypt. 
\v 14 And I will make Pathros desolate, and set fire to Zo'an; and I will execute judgments in No. 
\v 15 And I will pour my fury over Sin, the stronghold of Egypt; and I will cut off the multitude of No. 
\v 16 And I will set fire to Egypt: Sin shall have great pain, and No shall be broken in, and [over] Noph shall the besiegers [prevail] by broad day. 
\v 17 The young men of Aven and of Pi-besseth shall fall by the sword; and they themselves shall go into captivity. 
\v 18 And at Thechaphneches the day shall be darkened, when I break there the yoke-bars of Egypt, and the pride of her strength ceaseth therein: as for her, a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity. 
\v 19 Thus will I execute judgments on Egypt: and they shall know that I am the Lord. 
\v 20 And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month, on the seventh day of the month, that the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
\v 21 Son of man, the arm of Pharaoh the king of Egypt have I broken; and lo, it shall not be bound up to apply remedies, to put on a bandage to bind it up, to make it strong that it may grasp the sword. 
\v 22 Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I will be against Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and will break his arms, both the strong, and that which was already broken; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand. 
\v 23 And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and I will disperse them through the countries. 
\v 24 And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and will put my sword in his hand; but I will break the arms of Pharaoh, and he shall groan, with the groanings of a deadly wounded man before him. 
\v 25 Yea I will make strong the arms of the king of Babylon, but the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down: and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I place my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, that he may stretch it out over the land of Egypt. 
\v 26 And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them among the countries: and they shall know that I am the Lord. 
\c 31  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, on the first day of the month, that the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
\v 2 Son of man, say unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and to his multitude, Unto whom art thou like in thy arrogance? 
\v 3 Behold, Asshur was a cedar in Lebanon beautiful in its boughs, and a shadowing thicket, and high in stature; and among the thick-boughed trees was its highest branch. 
\v 4 The waters made it great, the deep made it high, with its rivers it was flowing round the place where it was planted, and its ditches it sent forth unto all the trees of the field. 
\v 5 Therefore became its stature higher than all the trees of the field, and its boughs were multiplied, and its branches became long because of the multitude of waters, when it stretched itself forth. 
\v 6 In its boughs made all the fowls of heaven their nest, and under its branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young, and under its shade dwelt all great nations. 
\v 7 And it was beautiful in its greatness, in the length of its light branches; for its root was by many waters. 
\v 8 The cedars could not obscure it in the garden of God; the firs were not like its boughs, and the chestnut-trees were not like its branches: not any tree in the garden of God was like unto it in its beauty. 
\v 9 Beautiful had I made it by the multitude of its light branches: so that all the trees of 'Eden that were in the garden of God, envied it. 
\v 10 Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Because thou wast so high in stature, and it had placed its highest branch between the thick-boughed trees, and its heart was lifted up through its height: 
\v 11 Therefore do I give it up into the hand of the mighty one of the nations; he shall surely deal with it at his pleasure; for its wickedness do I drive it out. 
\v 12 And strangers, the fiercest of nations, cut it down, and cast it to the ground: on the mountains and in all the valleys fall its light branches, and its boughs are [lying] broken in all the ravines of the land; and all the people of the earth are gone away from its shade, and have cast it to the ground. 
\v 13 Upon its fallen fragments dwell all the fowls of the heaven, and on its branches are all the beasts of the field: 
\v 14 In order that none of all the trees by the waters shall exalt themselves for their height, nor place their highest branch among the thick-boughed trees, and that all those that are nourished by water shall not place themselves erect, because of their height; for they are all given up unto death, to the land of the nether world, in the midst of the children of men, with those that go down to the pit. 
\v 15 Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, On the day when it went down to the grave I caused a mourning; I covered the deep for its sake, and I restrained its rivers, and the great waters were withheld; and I caused Lebanon to be clothed in black attire for its sake, and all the trees of the field were famished because of it. 
\v 16 Through the noise of its downfall I caused nations to quake, when I cast it down into the tomb with the [others] that descend into the pit: and in the land of the nether world comforted themselves all the trees of 'Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that were nourished by water. 
\v 17 They also went down with it into the tomb unto those that were slain with the sword, and its helpers that had dwelt under its shade in the midst of the nations. 
\v 18 To whom art thou then like in glory and in greatness among the trees of 'Eden? And thou too shalt be brought down with the trees of 'Eden unto the land of the nether world: in the midst of the uncircumcised shalt thou lie with those slain by the sword; yes, he, Pharaoh, and all his multitude, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\c 32  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, on the first day of the month, that the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
\v 2 Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and say unto him, Thou didst deem thyself like a young lion among the nations: while thou art as a crocodile in the seas; and thou issuedst forth with thy rivers, and madest turbid the waters with thy feet, and didst stir up their rivers. 
\v 3 Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, I will therefore spread out my net over thee through the assemblage of many people, and they shall draw thee up in my net. 
\v 4 Then will I cast thee upon the land, upon the open field will I hurl thee, and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to dwell upon thee, and I will satisfy off thee the beasts of all the earth. 
\v 5 And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys with thy carcass. 
\v 6 I will also saturate the land wherein thou swimmest with thy blood, even to the mountains; and the ravines shall be full of thee. 
\v 7 And I will cover up the heavens, when thou art quenched, and make their stars obscure: the sun will I cover up with a cloud, and the moon shall not let shine her light. 
\v 8 All the light-dispensing lights of the heavens—these will I make obscure because of thee, and I will lay darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\v 9 And I will aggrieve the heart of many people, when I bring those who are broken off from thee among the nations, into countries which thou hast not known. 
\v 10 Yea, I will make many people amazed at thee, and on their kings the hair shall stand on end because of thee, when I brandish my sword before their faces: and they shall tremble at every moment, every man for his own life, on the day of thy downfall. 
\v 11 For thus hath said the Lord Eternal, The sword of the king of Babylon shall come over thee. 
\v 12 By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall, the fiercest of nations are all of them: and they shall destroy the pride of Egypt, and all her multitude shall be annihilated. 
\v 13 And I will cause to vanish all her beasts from beside the great waters; and the foot of man shall not make them turbid any more, nor shall the hoofs of beasts make them turbid. 
\v 14 Then will I make clear their waters, and cause their rivers to flow like oil, saith the Lord Eternal; 
\v 15 When I render the land of Egypt desolate and wasted, the country bereft of what now filleth it, when I smite all those that dwell therein: and they shall know that I am the Lord. 
\v 16 This is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament for her; the daughters of the nations shall lament for her: for Egypt, and for all her multitude, shall they lament with it, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\v 17 And it came to pass in the twelfth year, on the fifteenth day of the month, that the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
\v 18 Son of man, moan for the multitude of Egypt, and say that it shall go down, yea, she, and the daughters of powerful nations, unto the land of the nether world, with those that go down to the pit. 
\v 19 Whom dost thou surpass in loveliness? go down [then], and be thou laid with the [other] uncircumcised. 
\v 20 In the midst of those that are slain by the sword shall they fall: to the sword is she given up; drag her away and all her multitudes. 
\v 21 Then will speak of him the strongest among the mighty out of the midst of the nether world with those that once helped him, They are gone down, there lie the uncircumcised,—slain by the sword. 
\v 22 There is Asshur and all his assemblage; round about him are his graves; all of them the slain that are fallen by the sword; 
\v 23 Whose graves are placed in the lowest depth of the pit, and his assemblage is round about his grave; all of them are slain, fallen by the sword, who once spread terror in the land of the living. 
\v 24 There is 'Elam and all her multitude round about her grave, all of them the slain, that are fallen by the sword, who are gone down uncircumcised into the land of the nether world, who once spread their terror in the land of the living; and they have borne their confusion with those that go down to the pit. 
\v 25 In the midst of the slain have they set a couch for her with all her multitude; all round about are her graves; all of them are uncircumcised, slain by the sword; because their terror was once spread in the land of the living; and they have borne their confusion with those that go down to the pit: in the midst of the slain was she placed. 
\v 26 There is Meshech, Thubal, and all her multitude; all round about her are her graves: all of them are the uncircumcised, slain by the sword; because they once spread their terror in the land of the living. 
\v 27 And those who are fallen of the uncircumcised shall not lie with the mighty, who are gone down to the nether world with their weapons of war, while men laid their swords under their heads, and the [instruments of] their iniquities were upon their bones; for the terror of the mighty was in the land of the living. 
\v 28 But thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and shalt lie with those that are slain by the sword. 
\v 29 There are Edom, her kings, and all her princes, who are laid despite their prowess by those that are slain by the sword: they shall lie with the uncircumcised, and with those that go down to the pit. 
\v 30 There are the chieftains of the north, all of them, and all the Zidonians, who are gone down with the slain: despite the terror they excited through their prowess are they made ashamed; and they lie uncircumcised with those that are slain by the sword, and bear their confusion with those that go down to the pit. 
\v 31 These shall Pharaoh see, and he shall be comforted over all his multitude: slain by the sword are Pharaoh and all his army, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\v 32 For I spread my terror in the land of the living; and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with those that are slain by the sword,—yea, Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\c 33  
\p
\v 1 And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
\v 2 Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, If there be a land over which I bring the sword, and the people of the land take a man from among themselves, and appoint him unto themselves for a watchman; 
\v 3 And if he see the sword coming over the land, and blow the cornet, and warn the people; 
\v 4 And whosoever heareth the sound of the cornet, and taketh no warning; and the sword cometh, and taketh him away: his blood shall be upon his own head. 
\v 5 The sound of the cornet hath he heard, and he hath taken no warning; his blood shall be upon him. But had he taken warning he would have delivered his soul. 
\v 6 But if the watchman see the sword coming, and blow not the cornet, so that the people be not warned, and the sword cometh, and taketh away from among them some person: this one is taken away for his iniquity; but his blood will I require from the watchman's hand. 
\v 7 But as for thee, O son of man, I have appointed thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: so that when thou hearest a word from my mouth, thou shalt warn them from me. 
\v 8 When I say unto the wicked, O wicked one, thou shalt surely die; and thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way: that wicked one shall die for his iniquity; but his blood will I require from thy hand. 
\v 9 Nevertheless, if thou hast indeed warned the wicked of his way to turn away from it, and he do not turn from his way: he shall certainly die for his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul. 
\v 10 But thou, O son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, Thus do ye speak, saying, Truly our transgressions and our sins are upon us, and through them do we pine away: how then shall we live? 
\v 11 Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord Eternal, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but in the return of the wicked from his way that he may live: return ye, return ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel? 
\v 12 But thou, son of man, say unto the children of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him on the day of his transgression; and as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not stumble through it on the day that he returneth from his wickedness; nor shall the righteous be able to live through the other on the day that he sinneth. 
\v 13 When I say of the righteous, that he shall surely live, and he trusteth to his own righteousness, and committeth what is wrong: all his righteous deeds shall not be remembered, and for his wrong that he hath committed,—through this shall he die. 
\v 14 Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and he turneth from his sin, and executeth justice and righteousness; 
\v 15 If the wicked restore the pledge, make restitution for what he hath robbed, walk in the statutes of life, so as not to do any wrong: he shall surely live, he shall not die. 
\v 16 All his sins that he hath committed shall not be remembered unto him: justice and righteousness hath he executed, he shall surely live. 
\v 17 Yet say the children of thy people, The way of the Lord is not equitable: while, as to them, their way is not equitable. 
\v 18 When the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and doth what is wrong, he shall even die therefore. 
\v 19 And when the wicked returneth from his wickedness, and executeth justice and righteousness, he shall surely live therefore. 
\v 20 Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equitable. Every one after his own ways will I judge you, O house of Israel. 
\v 21 And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the tenth month, on the fifth day of the month after our exile, that there came unto me one that had escaped out of Jerusalem, saying, The city hath been smitten. 
\v 22 Now the inspiration of the Lord was come upon me in the evening, before the coming of the one who had escaped; and he had opened my mouth, before he was come to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened and I was not kept dumb any more. 
\v 23 And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
\v 24 Son of man, they that dwell in these ruins in the land of Israel say as followeth, But one man was Abraham, and he obtained the land as an inheritance; and as we are many, the land must [surely] be given to us for an inheritance. 
\v 25 Therefore say unto them, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, By the blood do ye eat, and your eyes do you lift up toward your idols, and blood do ye shed: and ye expect to possess the land? 
\v 26 Ye depend upon your sword, ye commit abomination, and ye defile every one his neighbor's wife: and ye expect to possess the land? 
\v 27 Thus shalt thou say unto them, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, As I live, surely those that are in the ruined places shall fall by the sword, and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts that they may devour him, and those that are in the strongholds and in the caves shall die through the pestilence. 
\v 28 And I will render the land desolate and wasted, and the pride of her strength shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, with none to pass through them. 
\v 29 And they shall experience that I am the Lord, when I render the land desolate and wasted, because of all their abominations which they have committed. 
\v 30 And thou, son of man, [there are] the children of thy people, who are talking about thee by the walls and in the entrances of the houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Do come, and hear what the word is which cometh forth from the Lord. 
\v 31 And then they come unto thee as the people come, and they sit before thee [as] my people, and they hear thy words, but do not execute them; for as merry songs they carry them in their mouth, while their heart goeth after their unlawful gains. 
\v 32 And, lo, thou art unto them as a merry song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well: and [thus] they hear thy words, but execute them not. 
\v 33 But when it cometh to pass, [lo, it will come,] then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them. 
\c 34  
\p
\v 1 And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
\v 2 Son of man, prophesy concerning the shepherds of Israel; prophesy, and say unto them, unto the shepherds, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Woe to the shepherds of Israel who do feed themselves! should not the shepherds feed the flocks? 
\v 3 The fat ye eat, and with the wool ye clothe yourselves, those that are well fed ye slaughter; but the flock ye feed not. 
\v 4 The diseased have ye not strengthened, and the sick have ye not healed, and that which had a limb broken have ye not bound up, and the strayed have ye not brought back again, and what was lost have ye not sought for; but with force have ye ruled them and with rigor. 
\v 5 And they were scattered for want of a shepherd; and they became food unto all the beasts of the field, and they were scattered. 
\v 6 My sheep have to wander about on all the mountains, and upon every high hill: yea, over all the face of the land are my flock scattered, and there is none that inquireth and none that seeketh [after them]. 
\v 7 Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the Lord, 
\v 8 As I live, saith the Lord Eternal, surely because my flock became a prey, and my flock became food unto every beast of the field, because there was no shepherd, and my shepherds did not inquire for my flock, but the shepherds fed themselves, and my flock they fed not: 
\v 9 Therefore, O ye shepherds, hear the word of the Lord, 
\v 10 Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I will be against the shepherds, and I will require my flock from their hand, and I will stop them from feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more: and I will deliver my flock out of their mouth, that they may not serve them for food. 
\v 11 For thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I am here, and I will both inquire for my flocks, and search for them. 
\v 12 As a shepherd searcheth for his flock on the day that he is among his flocks that are scattered: so will I search for my flocks; and I will deliver them out of all places whither they have been scattered on the day of clouds and [tempestuous] darkness. 
\v 13 And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from the countries, and I will bring them to their own land; and I will feed them upon the mountains of Israel, in the ravines, and in all the inhabited places of the country. 
\v 14 On a good pasture will I feed them, and upon the high mountains of Israel shall be their fold: there shall they lie in a good fold, and in a fat pasture shall they feed on the mountains of Israel. 
\v 15 I myself will feed my flock, and I myself will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\v 16 That which was lost will I seek for, and that which was gone astray will I bring back again, and that which had a limb broken will I bind up, and the sick will I strengthen: but the fat and the strong will I destroy; I will feed them in justice. 
\v 17 And as for you, O my flock, thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I will judge between lamb and lamb, between the wethers and the he-goats. 
\v 18 Is it too little for you that ye can feed on the good pasture, that ye must tread down the residue of your pastures with your feet? and that ye can drink clear waters, that ye must render muddy with your feet what is left? 
\v 19 And as for my flock, what ye have trodden with your feet must they eat; and what ye have made muddy with your feet must they drink. 
\v 20 Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal unto them, Behold, I am here, and I will judge between the fat lamb and the lean lamb. 
\v 21 Because ye thrust with side and with shoulder, and push with your horns all the diseased, till ye have scattered them abroad: 
\v 22 Therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey; and I will judge between lamb and lamb. 
\v 23 And I will appoint over them one shepherd, and he shall feed them, namely, my servant David: he it is that shall feed them, and he it is that shall be unto them for a shepherd. 
\v 24 And I the Lord—I will be unto them for a God, and my servant David shall be a prince in their midst: I the Lord have spoken it. 
\v 25 And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and I will cause the wild beasts to cease out of the land: and they shall dwell in the wilderness in safety, and sleep in the forests. 
\v 26 And I will make them and the environs of my hill a blessing; and I will cause the rain to come down in its season; rains of blessing shall they be. 
\v 27 And the tree of the field shall yield its fruit, and the earth shall yield her products, and they shall be on their land in safety: and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I break the bands of their yoke, and deliver them out of the hand of those that had made them labor for them. 
\v 28 And they shall be no more a prey to the nations, and the beasts of the land shall not devour them; but they shall dwell in safety, with none to make them afraid. 
\v 29 And I will raise up for them a plantation for a [perpetual] renown, and they shall be no more taken away by hunger in the land, neither bear the shameful reproach of the nations any more. 
\v 30 Thus shall they experience that I the Lord their God am with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are my people, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\v 31 And ye my flock, the flock of my pasture, are men, [and] I am your God, saith the Lord Eternal.

\p
\v 1 And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
\v 2 Son of man, set thy face against the mountain of Se'ir, and prophecy against it, 
\v 3 And say unto it, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I will be against thee, O mountain of Se'ir, and I will stretch out my hand over thee, and I will render thee desolate and wasted. 
\v 4 Thy cities will I lay in ruins, and thou thyself shalt be desolate, and thou shalt know that I am the Lord. 
\v 5 Because thou hast had an undying hatred, and didst surrender the children of Israel to the power of the sword, at the time of their calamity, at the time of the iniquity of the end: 
\v 6 Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord Eternal, I will surely let thy blood flow, and blood shall pursue thee; since thou didst not hate blood-shedding, so shall blood pursue thee. 
\v 7 Thus will I change the mountain of Se'ir into a desolate land and a waste, and I will cut off from it him that travelleth forward and backward. 
\v 8 And I will fill his mountains with his slain: as regardeth thy hills, and thy valleys, and all thy ravines, in them shall fall those that are slain by the sword. 
\v 9 Into perpetual desolations will I change thee, and thy cities shall not be restored: and ye shall know that I am the Lord. 
\v 10 Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two countries shall indeed be mine, and we will take possession thereof; whereas the Lord was there: 
\v 11 Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord God, I will even do according to thy anger, and according to thy envy which thou didst use out of thy hatred against them; and I will make myself known among them, when I judge thee. 
\v 12 And thou shalt know that I am the Lord: I have heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid desolate, they are given unto us to consume them. 
\v 13 And ye boasted greatly against me with your mouth, and have multiplied against me your words: I have indeed heard them. 
\v 14 Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will make thee desolate. 
\v 15 As thou didst rejoice over the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was made desolate: so will I do unto thee; desolate shalt thou be, O mountain of Se'ir, and all Idumea—altogether; and they shall know that I am the Lord. 
\c 36  
\p
\v 1 But thou, son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of Israel, and say, O mountains of Israel, hear ye the word of the Lord. 
\v 2 Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Because the enemy hath said regarding you, Aha, even the ancient high-places are become ours as a possession: 
\v 3 Therefore prophesy and say, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Because, even because men have made you desolate, and sought to swallow you up on every side, that ye might become a possession unto the residue of the nations, and ye are taken up as a talk for tongues, and an evil report of the people: 
\v 4 Therefore, O mountains of Israel, hear ye the word of the Lord Eternal, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal to the mountains, and to the hills, to the ravines, and to the valleys, to the desolate ruins, and to the cities that are forsaken, which are become a prey and derision to the residue of the nations that are round about: 
\v 5 Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Surely in the fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the nations, and against all Idumea, that have appropriated my land unto themselves as a possession with the joy of all their heart, with derision in their soul, in order to drive it out that it may be for a prey. 
\v 6 Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say unto the mountains, and to the hills, to the ravines, and to the valleys, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, In my zealousness and in my fury have I spoken, because ye have borne the reproach of the nations: 
\v 7 Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, I have indeed lifted up my hand, that the nations who are round about you— these shall bear their shame. 
\v 8 But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall send forth your boughs, and your fruit shall ye bear for my people Israel, for they are near at hand to come. 
\v 9 For, behold, I will be for you, and I will turn unto you, and ye shall be tilled and ye shall be sown; 
\v 10 And I will multiply upon you men, all the house of Israel— altogether; and the cities shall be inhabited again, and the ruins shall be rebuilt; 
\v 11 And I will multiply upon you men and beast, and they shall increase and be fruitful; and I will cause you to be inhabited after your old estates, and will do more good unto you than at your beginnings: and ye shall know that I am the Lord. 
\v 12 Yea, I will cause to walk upon you men, even my people Israel, and they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be unto them as an inheritance, and thou shalt not any more henceforth cast them out. 
\v 13 Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Because they say unto you, Thou land devourest up men, and hast been one that hath ever cast out thy nations: 
\v 14 Therefore shalt thou not devour up men any more, and thy nations shalt thou not cast out any more, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\v 15 And I will not let be heard against thee any more the reproach of the nations, and the disgrace of the people shalt thou not bear any more, and thy nations shalt thou not cast out any more, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\v 16 And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
\v 17 Son of man, the house of Israel, when they dwelt in their own land, defiled it through their way and through their doings: like the uncleanness of a woman in her separation was their way before me. 
\v 18 And I poured out my fury over them because of the blood that they had shed in the land, and because through their idols they had polluted it; 
\v 19 And I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries: according to their way and according to their doings did I judge them. 
\v 20 And when they were come unto the nations, whither they were gone, they profaned my holy name; because they said of them, These are the people of the Lord, and out of his land are they gone forth. 
\v 21 But I had pity for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations, whither they were gone. 
\v 22 Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Not for your sake do I this, O house of Israel, but for the sake of my holy name, which ye have profaned among the nations, whither ye are gone. 
\v 23 And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the nations, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the nations shall know that I am the Lord, saith the Lord Eternal, when I will be sanctified through you before your eyes. 
\v 24 And I will take you from among the nations, and I will gather you out of all the countries, and I will bring you unto your own land. 
\v 25 And I will sprinkle upon you clean water, and ye shall be clean: from all your impurities, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you. 
\v 26 And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit will I put within you; and I will remove the heart of stone out of your body, and I will give you a heart of flesh. 
\v 27 And my spirit I will put within you, and I will cause that you shall walk in my statutes, and that my ordinances ye shall keep, and do them. 
\v 28 And ye shall dwell in the land which I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be unto me for a people, and I truly will be unto you as a God. 
\v 29 And I will save you from all kinds of your impurities; and I will call unto the corn, and increase it, and I will not lay famine upon you. 
\v 30 And I will multiply the fruit of the trees, and the products of the field: in order that ye may receive no more reproach on account of famine among the nations. 
\v 31 Then shall ye remember your ways that they were evil, and your doings that were not good; and ye shall loathe yourselves on account of your iniquities and on account of your abominations. 
\v 32 Not for your sake do I this, saith the Lord Eternal, be it known unto you: be ashamed and confounded because of your ways, O house of Israel. 
\v 33 Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, On the day of my cleansing you from all your iniquities, when I cause the cities to be inhabited, and when the ruins are built up, 
\v 34 And when the desolate land is tilled, instead that it was a waste before the eyes of every passer by: 
\v 35 Then shall they say, This land, that was desolate, is become like the garden of 'Eden; and the cities that were ruined, and desolate, and broken down, are become fortified, and inhabited. 
\v 36 And the nations that are left round about you shall know that I the Lord have built up the broken-down [places], have planted the desolate [land]: I the Lord have spoken this, and have done it. 
\v 37 Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Also in this will I yet suffer myself to be entreated of by the house of Israel, to do it for them, I will increase them with men like flocks [in multitude]. 
\v 38 As the flocks of the holy things, as the flocks of Jerusalem on her appointed feasts, so shall the ruined cities be full of flocks of men: and they shall know that I am the Lord. 
\c 37  
\p
\v 1 There came over me the inspiration of the Lord, and he carried me out in the spirit of the Lord, and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones; 
\v 2 And he caused me to pass by them all round about; and, behold, there were very many of them on the surface of the valley; and, lo, they were very dry. 
\v 3 And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live! And I said, O Lord Eternal, thou alone knowest this. 
\v 4 And he said unto me, Prophesy over these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear ye the word of the Lord. 
\v 5 Thus hath said the Lord Eternal unto these bones, Behold, I will bring a spirit into you, and ye shall live; 
\v 6 And I will lay sinews upon you, and bring up flesh upon you, and draw over you a skin, and put a spirit in you, and ye shall live: and ye shall experience that I am the Lord. 
\v 7 And so I prophesied as I had been commanded: and there was a sound, as I prophesied, and behold there was a rustling noise, and the bones came together, bone to its bone. 
\v 8 And I looked, and behold, there were sinews upon them, and the flesh came up, and the skin was drawn over them above; but no spirit was in them. 
\v 9 Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the spirit; prophesy, son of man, and say to the spirit, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, From the four winds come, O spirit, and breathe into these slain ones, that they may live. 
\v 10 And I prophesied as he had commanded me, and there came into them the spirit, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceedingly great army. 
\v 11 Then said he unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Dried are our bones, and lost is our hope; we are quite cut off. 
\v 12 Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I will open your graves, and I will cause you to come up out of your graves, O my people, and I will bring you into the land of Israel. 
\v 13 And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I open your graves, and when I cause you to come up out of your graves, O my people. 
\v 14 And I will put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I will place you in your own land: and ye shall acknowledge that I the Lord have spoken it, and done it, saith the Lord. 
\v 15 And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
\v 16 But thou, son of man, take unto thyself one stick of wood, and write upon it, “For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions;” then take another stick, and write upon it, “For Joseph,—the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel his companions:” 
\v 17 And join them one to the other unto thee as one stick; and they shall become one in thy hand. 
\v 18 And if the children of thy people should say unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not tell us what thou meanest by these? 
\v 19 [Then] speak unto them, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph,—which is in the hand of Ephraim,—and the tribes of Israel his companions, and will lay them upon him, even the stick of Judah, and make them into one stick, and they shall be one in my hand. 
\v 20 And the sticks whereon thou shalt have written shall be in thy hand before their eyes. 
\v 21 And speak unto them, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the nations, whither they are gone, and I will gather them from every side, and bring them unto their own land; 
\v 22 And I will make them into one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be to them all for king; and they shall not be any more two nations, nor shall they at any time be divided into two kingdoms any more: 
\v 23 Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, and with their detestable things, and with all their transgressions; but I will save them out of all their dwelling-places, wherein they have sinned, and I will cleanse them, and they shall be unto me for a people, and I will be to them for a God. 
\v 24 And my servant David shall be king over them; and one shepherd shall be for them all: and in my ordinances shall they walk, and my statutes shall they observe, and do them. 
\v 25 And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto my servant, unto Jacob, wherein your fathers have dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, they, and their children, and their children's children for ever: and David my servant shall be prince unto them for ever. 
\v 26 And I will make with them a covenant of peace, an everlasting covenant shall it be with them: and I will multiply them, and I will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore. 
\v 27 My dwelling also shall be with them, and I will be unto them for a God; and they shall be unto me as a people. 
\v 28 And the nations shall know that I am the Lord who sanctify Israel, when my sanctuary will be in the midst of them for evermore. 
\c 38  
\p
\v 1 And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
\v 2 Son of man, direct thy face against Gog of the land of Magog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech and Thubal, and prophesy against him, 
\v 3 And say, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I will be against thee, O Gog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech and Thubal; 
\v 4 And I will derange thee, and put hooks into thy jaws, and I will bring thee forth, and all thy army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed in elegant attire, a great assemblage with bucklers and shields, all of them grasping swords. 
\v 5 Persia, Cush, and Put [shall be] with them; all of them with shield and helmet; 
\v 6 Gomer and all of its armies; the house of Thogarmah out of the farthest north, and all its armies; many people shall be with thee. 
\v 7 Be thou ready, and prepare thyself, thou, and all thy assemblages that are assembled about thee, and be thou a guard unto them. 
\v 8 After many days shalt thou be ordered forward; in the end of years shalt thou come into the land that is recovering from the sword, and is gathered together out of many people, against the mountains of Israel, which have been ruined for a very long time: [to a people] that are brought forth out of the nations, and that now dwell in safety, all of them. 
\v 9 Thou wilt ascend and come like a tempest, like a cloud to cover the earth wilt thou be, thou, and all thy armies, and the many people with thee. 
\v 10 Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, It will also come to pass, at the same time, that things will come into thy mind, and thou wilt entertain an evil device; 
\v 11 And thou wilt say, I will go up over the land of open towns; I will come against those that are careless, that dwell in safety, all of whom dwell without walls, and have neither bars nor gates, 
\v 12 To snatch up the spoil, and to take away the prey; to turn thy hand against the ruined places now inhabited, and against the people that are gathered out of the nations, that have gotten cattle and goods, that dwell in the highest part of the land. 
\v 13 Sheba, and Dedan, and the traders of Tharshish, with all her young lions, will say unto thee, Art thou come to plunder the spoil? hast thou gathered thy company to carry off the prey? to bear away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to plunder a great spoil? 
\v 14 Therefore, prophesy, son of man, and say unto Gog, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, on the day when my people of Israel dwelleth in safety, shalt thou know [my power]. 
\v 15 And thou wilt come from thy place out of the farthest ends of the north, thou, and many people with thee, all of them riding upon horses, a great assemblage, and a mighty army; 
\v 16 And thou wilt come up against my people of Israel, like a cloud to cover the land; in the latter days will this be, and I will bring thee over my land, in order that the nations may know me, when I am sanctified on thee, before their eyes, O Gog. 
\v 17 Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Art thou [not] he of whom I have spoken in ancient days through means of my servants the prophets of Israel, who prophesied in those days [many] years, that I would bring thee against them? 
\v 18 And it shall come to pass at the same time, on the day of Gog's coming over the land of Israel, saith the Lord Eternal, that my fury shall be kindled in my nose. 
\v 19 And in my zealousness, in the fire of my wrath, have I spoken, Surely on that day there shall be a great earthquake in the country of Israel; 
\v 20 And there shall quake at my presence the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the field, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and all the men that are upon the face of the earth, and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the cliffs shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground. 
\v 21 And I will call against him throughout all my mountains for the sword, saith the Lord Eternal: every man's sword shall be against his brother. 
\v 22 And I will hold judgment over him with pestilence and with blood [-shedding]; and an overflowing rain, and great hailstones, fire, and sulfur will I let rain over him and his armies, and over the many people that are with him. 
\v 23 Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself, and make myself known before the eyes of many nations: and they shall know that I am the Lord. 
\c 39  
\p
\v 1 But thou, O son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I will be against thee O Gog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech and Thubal; 
\v 2 And I will derange thee, and lead thee astray, and will cause thee to come up from the farthest ends of the north; and I will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel; 
\v 3 And I will strike thy bow out of thy left hand, and thy arrows will I cause to fall out of thy right hand. 
\v 4 Upon the mountains of Israel shalt thou fall, thou, and all thy armies, and the people that are with thee: unto the ravenous birds, to every thing that hath wings, and to the beasts of the field, do I give thee for food. 
\v 5 Upon the open field shalt thou fall; for I have spoken it, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\v 6 And I will send a fire against Magog, and against those that dwell in the isles in safety: and they shall know that I am the Lord. 
\v 7 And my holy name will I make known in the midst of my people Israel; and I will not permit my holy name to be profaned any more: and the nations shall know that I am the Lord, Holy in Israel. 
\v 8 Behold, it cometh, and it taketh place, saith the Lord Eternal; this is the day whereof I have spoken. 
\v 9 And the inhabitants of the cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall burn and make fire for heating of the weapons, and shields and bucklers, of bows and of arrows, and of hand-staves, and of spears; and they shall feed with them the fire for seven years; 
\v 10 And they shall take no wood out of the field, nor cut down any out of the forests; for with weapons shall they feed the fire: and they shall spoil those that spoiled them, and plunder those that plundered them, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\v 11 And it shall come to pass on that day, that I will give unto Gog a place there for a grave in Israel, the valley where people pass over to the east of the sea; and it shall stop the passengers [from passing]: and they shall bury there Gog and all his multitude, and they shall call it The valley of the multitude of Gog. 
\v 12 And the house of Israel shall be burying them, in order to cleanse the land, during seven months. 
\v 13 Yea, all the people of the land shall bury them; and it shall be to them as a renown on the day that I glorify myself, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\v 14 And men constantly devoted to this shall they set apart to pass through the land, to bury with those that pass through those that remain upon the face of the earth, to cleanse it; at the end of seven months shall they make a search. 
\v 15 And those that thus travel will pass through the land; and when any one seeth a human bone, then will he set up a sign by it, till the buriers have buried it in the valley of the multitude of Gog. 
\v 16 And also the name of the city shall be Hamonah. Thus shall they cleanse the land. 
\v 17 And thou, O son of man, thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Say unto the birds, to every thing that hath wings, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves from every side to my sacrifice that I do slaughter for you, as a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh, and drink blood. 
\v 18 The flesh of the mighty shall ye eat, and the blood of the princes of the earth shall ye drink,—wethers, lambs, and he-goats, bullocks, fatlings of Bashan are they all of them. 
\v 19 And ye shall eat fat till ye be sated, and ye shall drink blood till ye be drunken, from my sacrifice which I have slaughtered for you. 
\v 20 And ye shall be sated at my table on horses and chariot-teams, on mighty men, and on all men of war, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\v 21 And I will display my glory among the nations: and all the nations shall see my punishment that I execute, and my hand that I lay on them. 
\v 22 And the house of Israel shall acknowledge that I am the Lord their God from that day and forward. 
\v 23 And the nations shall know that for their iniquity did the house of Israel go into exile; because they had trespassed against me, and I had hidden my face from them; and I gave them up therefore into the hand of their oppressors, and they all fell by the sword. 
\v 24 According to their uncleanness, and according to their transgressions did I deal with them, and hid my face from them. 
\v 25 Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Now will I bring back again the captivity of Jacob, and I will have mercy upon the whole house of Israel, and will be zealous for my holy name; 
\v 26 And they shall feel their disgrace, and all their trespass whereby they had trespassed against me, when they dwelt in their land in safety, with none to make them afraid: 
\v 27 When I bring them back again from the people, and gather them out of the land of their enemies, and sanctify myself on them before the eyes of the many nations. 
\v 28 And they shall know that I am the Lord their God; because I had exiled them among the nations, but gather them now unto their own land, and leave none of them any more there. 
\v 29 And I will not hide my face any more from them; for I will have poured out my spirit over the house of Israel, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\c 40  
\p
\v 1 In the five and twentieth year of our exile, in the beginning of the year, on the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city had been smitten, on the selfsame day came the inspiration of the Lord upon me, and brought me thither. 
\v 2 In the visions of God brought he me unto the land of Israel, and set me down upon a very high mount, on which there was built something like a city on the south. 
\v 3 And when he had brought me thither, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of copper, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring-rod: and he was standing in the gate. 
\v 4 And the man spoke unto me, Son of man, behold with thy eyes, and hear with thy ears, and direct thy heart unto all that I am about to show thee; for in order to show it unto thee art thou brought hither: tell all that thou seest to the house of Israel. 
\v 5 And behold there was a wall on the outside of the house all round about, and in the man's hand was a measuring-rod of six cubits long by the cubit which was a hand's breadth longer than usual; and he measured the breadth of the building, one rod, and the height, one rod. 
\v 6 Then came he unto the gate which looked in the direction toward the east, and went up its steps, and measured the threshold of the gate, one rod in breadth, and the other threshold one rod in breadth. 
\v 7 And every cell was one rod long, and one rod broad; and between the cells were five cubits: and the threshold of the gate near by the porch of the gate within was one rod. 
\v 8 He measured also the porch of the gate within, one rod. 
\v 9 Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits, and its door-posts, two cubits: and the porch of the gate was inward. 
\v 10 And the cells of the gate in the eastern direction were three on this side, and three on that side, one measure was for all the three; and there was one measure for the door-posts on this side and on that side. 
\v 11 And he measured the breadth of the entrance of the gate, ten cubits, [and] the length of the gate, thirteen cubits. 
\v 12 And there was a space before the cells of one cubit on this side, and one cubit space was there on that side: and every cell was of six cubits on this side, and of six cubits on that side. 
\v 13 And he measured the gate from the roof of [one] cell to the roof of [another], in breadth five and twenty cubits, one door being against [the other] door. 
\v 14 And he made door-posts of sixty cubits, and around the door-posts the court and the gate all round about. 
\v 15 And the height of the gate of the entrance as also the height of the porch of the inner gate was fifty cubits. 
\v 16 And there were narrow windows in the cells, and by their door-posts within the gate all round about, and likewise in the porches: and windows were all round about inward; and on each door post were palm-shaped [capitals]. 
\v 17 Then brought he me into the outward court, and, lo, there were chambers, and a pavement made for the court all round about: thirty chambers were upon the pavement. 
\v 18 And the pavement by the side of the gates was all along the whole length of the gates: this was the lower pavement. 
\v 19 Then measured he the breadth from the front of the lower gate unto the front of the inner court, without, one hundred cubits, eastward and northward. 
\v 20 And the gate of the outer court that looked in a northern direction, he measured after its length, and its breadth. 
\v 21 And its cells were three on this side and three on that side; and its door-posts and its porches were after the measure of the first gate: fifty cubits was its length, and its breadth five and twenty cubits. 
\v 22 And its windows, and its porches, and their palm-shaped capitals, were after the measure of the gate that looked in an eastern direction: and by seven steps did they go up unto it, and to its porches which were before them. 
\v 23 And the gates of the inner court were opposite the gates on the north, and on the east: and he measured from gate to gate one hundred cubits. 
\v 24 After that he led me forth to the south side, and behold there was a gate on the south side: and he measured its door-posts and its porches after these measures. 
\v 25 And there were windows in it and in its porches all round about, like the other windows: it was fifty cubits in length, and in breadth five and twenty cubits. 
\v 26 And by seven steps was the ascent to it, and to its porches which were before them; and it had palm-shaped capitals, one on this side, and another on that side, upon its door-posts. 
\v 27 And there was a gate in the inner court on the south side: and he measured from gate to gate on the south side one hundred cubits. 
\v 28 And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate; and he measured the south gate after these measures; 
\v 29 And its cells, and its door-posts, and its porches were after these measures; and there were windows in it and in its porches all round about: it was fifty cubits in length, and in breadth five and twenty cubits. 
\v 30 And arched passages were all round about, five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad. 
\v 31 And its porches were toward the outer court; and palm-shaped capitals were upon its door-posts: and its ascent was by eight steps. 
\v 32 And he brought me into the inner court on the east side; and he measured the gate after these measures; 
\v 33 And its cells and its door-posts, and its porches, were according to these measures; and there were windows in it and in its porches all round about: its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth five and twenty cubits. 
\v 34 And its porches were toward the outward court; and palm-shaped capitals were upon its door-posts, on this side, and on that side: and by eight steps was the ascent to it. 
\v 35 And he brought me to the north gate, and he measured it after these measures; 
\v 36 Its cells, its door-posts, and its porches; and the windows in it were all round about: its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth five and twenty cubits. 
\v 37 And its door-posts were toward the outer court; and palm-shaped capitals were upon its door-posts, on this side, and on that side: and by eight steps was the ascent to it. 
\v 38 And there was a chamber with its door by the door-posts of the gates, where they washed off the burnt-offerings. 
\v 39 And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slaughter thereon the burnt-offerings and the sin-offerings and the trespass-offerings. 
\v 40 And at the side without [the porch], as one went up to the entrance of the north gate, were two tables; and on the other side of the porch of the gate were two tables; 
\v 41 Four tables being on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate, eight tables, whereupon they slaughtered [the sacrifices]. 
\v 42 And there were four tables of hewn stone for the burnt-offerings, of a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high: whereupon they laid the instruments wherewith they slaughtered the burnt-offerings and the sacrifices. 
\v 43 And hooks, a hand long, were fastened within all round about: and on the tables was placed the flesh of the offerings. 
\v 44 And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their front was toward the south side: one was at the side of the east gate having the front toward the north side. 
\v 45 And he spoke unto me, This chamber, the front of which is toward the south, is for the priests who have the charge of the house. 
\v 46 And the chamber, the front of which is toward the north, is for the priests who have the charge of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok, who come near, from among the sons of Levi, to the Lord to minister unto him. 
\v 47 So he measured the court, in length one hundred cubits, and in breadth one hundred cubits, foursquare: and the altar [stood] before the house. 
\v 48 And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each door-post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side. 
\v 49 The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits, together with the steps whereby they went up to it: and there were pillars by the door-posts, one on this side, and another on that side. 
\c 41  
\p
\v 1 And he brought me to the temple: and he measured the door-posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, [as also] the breadth of the tabernacle. 
\v 2 And the breadth of the door was ten cubits; and the sides of the door were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured its length, forty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits. 
\v 3 Then went he inward, and measured the posts of the door, two cubits; and the door was six cubits high; and the breadth of the door, was seven cubits. 
\v 4 And he measured its length, twenty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, fronting on the temple: and he said unto me, This is the most holy place. 
\v 5 After this he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of every side-chamber was four cubits, all round about the house on every side. 
\v 6 And the side-chambers were one over another, three and thirty times; and they entered into the wall which was on the house for the side-chambers all round about, that they might be fastened on, but they were not fastened on the wall of the house. 
\v 7 And as one wound upward it became continually wider for the side-chambers; for the row of chambers about the house went more and more upward round about the house; therefore was the breadth of the house greater upward: and so they ascended from the lowest chambers to the highest through the middle ones. 
\v 8 And I saw the height of the house all round about: the foundations of the side-chambers were a full rod of six cubits under ground. 
\v 9 The thickness of the wall, which was for the side-chambers without, was five cubits, as also the space which was left open by the row of the side-chambers that were on the house. 
\v 10 And between the chambers there was a width of twenty cubits round about the house on every side. 
\v 11 And the doors of the side-chambers were on the open space, one door was in a northern direction, and another door on the south; and the breadth of the place that was left open was five cubits all round about. 
\v 12 Now the building that was before the main wing on the west side was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and its length, ninety cubits. 
\v 13 So he measured the house, in length one hundred cubits; and the main wing, and the building, with its walls, in length one hundred cubits; 
\v 14 Also the breadth in the front of the house, and of the main wing on the east, was one hundred cubits. 
\v 15 And he measured the length of the building on the front side of the main wing which was behind it, and its corner-pillars on the one side and on the other side, one hundred cubits; and this included the inner temple, and the porches of the court; 
\v 16 The thresholds, and the narrow windows, and the corner-pillars were round about on their three sides: opposite the threshold there was a wainscoting of wood all round about, and so from the ground up to the windows; and the windows were covered. 
\v 17 On the part above the door, and as far as the inner house, and the outer [house], was [a wainscoting], and on all the wall round about within and without, by [the same] measure; 
\v 18 And it was ornamented with cherubim and palm-trees, a palm-tree being between two cherubim; and every cherub had two faces; 
\v 19 So that a human face was toward the palm-tree on the one side, and a young lion's face toward the palm-tree on the other side: it was so made on all the house round about. 
\v 20 From the ground to the part above the door were the cherubim and the palm-trees made, and so on the wall of the temple. 
\v 21 The temple had four-cornered door-posts, and the front of the holy of holies had the [same] appearance as the appearance [of the other]. 
\v 22 The altar was of wood, three cubits high, and its length was two cubits; and its corners, and its top-piece, and its walls, were of wood: and he spoke unto me, This is the table that is before the Lord. 
\v 23 And the temple and the holy of holies had two doors. 
\v 24 And the doors had two leaves [apiece], two turning leaves, two [leaves] for the one door, and two leaves for the other. 
\v 25 And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubim and palm-trees, as they were made upon the walls; and [a covering of] thick wooden planks was upon the front of the porch without. 
\v 26 And there were narrow windows and palm-trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch, and on the side-chambers of the house, and the [covering of] thick planks. 
\c 42  
\p
\v 1 And he led me forth into the outer court, on the way to the north side; and he brought me into the [row of] chambers that was opposite the main wing, and which was opposite the building toward the north; 
\v 2 On the front side the length [of which] was a hundred cubits, [up to] the north door, while the breadth was fifty cubits. 
\v 3 Opposite the twenty cubits which were for the inner court, and opposite the pavement which was for the outer court, was corner-pillar before corner-pillar in the three stories. 
\v 4 And before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits in breadth toward the inner house, a way of one cubit [in width]; and their doors were toward the north. 
\v 5 Now the upper chambers were shorter [for the corner-pillar took away part of the space from them] than the lowest and than the middle chambers of the building. 
\v 6 For they were in three stories, but had not pillars like the pillars of the courts: therefore was something taken off the lowest and the middle ones [as one ascended] from the ground. 
\v 7 And the wall that was without alongside the chambers, toward the outer court in front of the chambers, was in its length fifty cubits. 
\v 8 For the length of the chambers that were in the outer court was fifty cubits; and lo, [the whole space] in front of the temple was one hundred cubits. 
\v 9 And beneath these chambers was the entrance from the east side, as one goeth into them from the outer court. 
\v 10 On the breadth of the wall of the court in an eastern direction before the main wing, and before the building, were chambers. 
\v 11 And the way before them was of like appearance as that for the chambers which were on the north side, of the same length and the same breadth; and all their means of egress, and their arrangement, and their doors were of the like manner. 
\v 12 And so also were the doors of the chambers that were on the south side, a door being on the head of the way, of the way directly before the wall on the east side, as one entereth into them. 
\v 13 And he said unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers which are in front of the main wing,—these are the holy chambers, where the priests that approach unto the Lord shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, namely, the meat-offering, and the sin-offering, and the trespass-offering; for the place is holy. 
\v 14 When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the sanctuary into the outer court; but there shall they lay down their garments wherein they may have ministered; for they are holy: and they shall put on other garments, and shall then approach to [the court] which is for the people. 
\v 15 Now when he had finished the measurings of the inner house, he led me forth by the way of the gate which looked in an eastern direction, and measured it all round about. 
\v 16 He measured the east side with the measuring-rod, five hundred rods, with the measuring-rod round about. 
\v 17 He measured the north aide, five hundred rods, with the measuring-rod round about. 
\v 18 The south side he measured, five hundred rods, with the measuring-rod. 
\v 19 He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred rods with the measuring-rod. 
\v 20 On the four sides did he measure it by the wall that was all round about, five hundred rods in length, and in breadth five hundred, to make a separation between the holy place and the profane. 
\c 43  
\p
\v 1 Then did he lead me to the gate, even the gate that was turned in an eastern direction. 
\v 2 And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east; and his voice was like a noise of many waters; and the earth gave light from his glory. 
\v 3 And it was like the appearance of the vision which I had seen, yea, like the vision that I had seen when I came to destroy the city; and the visions were like the vision that I had seen by the river Kebar: and I fell upon my face. 
\v 4 And the glory of the Lord came into the house by the way of the gate which was turned in an eastern direction. 
\v 5 Then did the Spirit take me up, and bring me into the inner court: and, behold, the glory of the Lord filled the house. 
\v 6 And I heard him speaking unto me out of the house; and a man was standing alongside of me. 
\v 7 And he said unto me, Son of man, [this] is the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel forever: and the house of Israel shall not defile any more my holy name, neither they, nor their kings, by their lewdness, nor by the carcasses of their kings on their high-places. 
\v 8 Inasmuch as they placed their threshold by my threshold, and their door-posts close by my door-posts, and the wall being only between me and them, and they defiled my holy name by their abominations which they committed; so that I made an end of them in my anger. 
\v 9 Now will they have to put away their lewdness, and the carcasses of their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever. 
\v 10 Thou, son of man, tell the house of Israel of the house, that they may be confounded because of their iniquities: and let them measure the outlines. 
\v 11 And if they be confounded because of all that they have done: then let them know the form of the house, and its arrangements, and its means of egress, and its entrances, and all its forms, and all its statutes, and all its forms, and all its laws, and write them down before their eyes; that they may observe the whole of its form, and all its statutes, and carry them out. 
\v 12 This is the law for the house, Upon the top of the mount shall its whole limit all round about be most holy: behold, this is the law for the house. 
\v 13 And these are the measures of the altar in cubits, The cubit is a cubit and a hand-breadth; and the bottom shall be a cubit high, and a cubit broad, and its border on its edge round about shall be a span: and this shall be the outside of the altar. 
\v 14 And from the bottom upon the ground up to the lower projection shall be two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser projection up to the greater projection shall be four cubits, and the breadth one cubit. 
\v 15 And the upper portion of the altar shall be four cubits; and from the upper surface of the altar and upward shall be the four horns. 
\v 16 And the upper surface of the altar shall be twelve cubits long, by twelve broad, square on its four sides. 
\v 17 And the projection shall be fourteen cubits in length, by fourteen in breadth on its four sides; and the border round about it shall be half a cubit; and its bottom shall be a cubit round about; and its steps shall look toward the east. 
\v 18 And he said unto me, Son of man, thus hath said the Lord Eternal, These are the statutes of the altar on the day when it shall be finished, to offer thereon burnt-offerings, and to sprinkle thereon blood. 
\v 19 And thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that are of the seed of Zadok, who approach unto me, saith the Lord Eternal, to minister unto me, a young bullock for a sin-offering. 
\v 20 And thou shalt take of his blood, and put it on its four horns, and on the four corners of the projection, and upon the border round about; and thou shalt cleanse it and make an atonement for it. 
\v 21 And thou shalt take the bullock of the sin-offering, and some one shall burn him at an appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary. 
\v 22 And on the second day shalt thou offer a he-goat without blemish for a sin-offering: and they shall cleanse the altar, as they did cleanse it with the bullock. 
\v 23 When thou hast made an end of cleansing it, shalt thou offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish. 
\v 24 And thou shalt bring them near before the Lord, and the priests shall throw salt upon them, and they shall offer them up as a burnt-offering unto the Lord. 
\v 25 Seven days shalt thou prepare a goat for a sin-offering every day; and a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish shall they prepare. 
\v 26 Seven days shall they atone for the altar and purify it; and they shall consecrate the same. 
\v 27 And when these days are expired, it shall be, that on the eighth day, and thenceforward, the priests shall prepare upon the altar your burnt-offerings, and your peace-offerings: and I will accept you in favor, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\c 44  
\p
\v 1 And he brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary which looked toward the east: and it was locked. 
\v 2 Then said the Lord unto me, This gate shall remain locked, it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the Lord, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore shall it remain locked. 
\v 3 As for the prince, being the prince, he shall sit in it to eat bread before the Lord: by the way of the porch of that gate shall he enter, and by the way of the same shall he go out. 
\v 4 Then brought he me by the way of the north gate before the house; and I looked, and, behold, the glory of the Lord filled the house of the Lord: and I fell upon my face. 
\v 5 And the Lord said unto me, Son of man, direct thy mind, and see with thy eyes, and hear with thy ears all that I am speaking with thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of the Lord, and of all its laws; and direct thy mind to the entrance of the house, with every place of egress of the sanctuary. 
\v 6 And thou shalt say to the rebellious, to the house of Israel, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Ye have done enough with all your abominations, O house of Israel! 
\v 7 In your having brought the sons of the stranger, uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to pollute it, even my house, while you were offering my food, the fat and the blood: so that they broke my covenant because of all your abominations. 
\v 8 And [because] ye have not kept the charge of my holy things; but ye have set [those unworthy ones] as keepers of my charge in my sanctuary at your own pleasure. 
\v 9 Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, No son of the stranger, uncircumcised in heart, or uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of all the sons of the stranger that are in the midst of the children of Israel. 
\v 10 But as respecteth the Levites that were gone away far from me, when Israel went astray, who went astray away from me, after their idols, they shall surely bear their iniquity; 
\v 11 And they shall be in my sanctuary, servants, appointed to watch at the gates of the house, and to be servants for the house: these are they that shall slay the burnt-offerings and the sacrifices for the people, and they shall stand before them to do the service for them. 
\v 12 Because that they used to serve them before their idols, and have been unto the house of Israel as a stumbling-block of iniquity; therefore have I lifted up my hand against them, saith the Lord Eternal, and they shall bear their iniquity; 
\v 13 And they shall not come near unto me, to officiate as priests unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, to the most holy things; but they shall bear their shame, yea, for their abominations which they have committed. 
\v 14 And I will appoint them to be keepers of the charge of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein. 
\v 15 But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me,—these are they that shall come near unto me to minister unto me, and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord Eternal: 
\v 16 These are they that shall enter into my sanctuary, and these shall come near to my table, to minister unto me; and they shall keep my charge. 
\v 17 And it shall come to pass, that, when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall clothe themselves with linen garments; and there shall no wool come upon them, when they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within the house. 
\v 18 Linen bonnets shall be upon their heads, and linen breeches shall be upon their loins: they shall not gird themselves with any thing that causeth sweat. 
\v 19 And when they go forth into the outer court, into the outer court to the people: then shall they put off their garments wherein they have ministered, and they shall lay them down in the holy chambers; and they shall put on other garments, and they shall not mingle among the people with their garments. 
\v 20 And their heads shall they not shave close, nor suffer their hair to grow long: they shall only crop [the hair of] their heads. 
\v 21 And wine shall none of the priests drink when they enter into the inner court. 
\v 22 And a widow, or one that is divorced from her husband shall they not take to themselves as wives; but only virgins of the seed of the house of Israel; but whatever widow it may be, the [common] priests may take. 
\v 23 And my people shall they teach the difference between the holy and profane, and that between the unclean and the clean shall they make known unto them. 
\v 24 And in a controversy shall they stand up to judge, according to my ordinances shall they decide it: and my laws and my statutes at all my festivals shall they observe, and my sabbaths shall they sanctify. 
\v 25 And to a dead person shall they not come to defile themselves; but on father, or on mother, or on son, or on daughter, on brother, or on sister that hath had no husband, may they defile themselves. 
\v 26 And after he is become clean,—they shall reckon unto him seven days,— 
\v 27 Then shall he on the day that he cometh into the sanctuary, into the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, offer his sin-offering, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\v 28 And it shall be unto them as an inheritance, I am their inheritance: and any possession shall you not give them in Israel, I am their possession. 
\v 29 The meat-offering, and the sin-offering, and the trespass-offering—these shall they eat; and every devoted thing in Israel shall belong to them. 
\v 30 And the first of all kinds of first-fruits of all, and every kind of heave-offering of every thing of all your heave-offerings, shall belong to the priests; and the first of your dough shall you give to the priest, to cause a blessing to rest on thy house. 
\v 31 Any thing that hath died of itself, or that is torn, whether it be fowl or beast, shall the priests not eat. 
\c 45  
\p
\v 1 And when ye divide the land by lot for an inheritance, shall ye offer an oblation unto the Lord, as a holy portion of the land, five and twenty thousand rods in length, and in breadth ten thousand. This shall be holy in all its extent round about. 
\v 2 Of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred [rods] by five hundred, square round about; and fifty cubits as an open space for it round about. 
\v 3 And of this measure shalt thou measure, in length five and twenty thousand, and in breadth ten thousand [rods]: and in it shall be the sanctuary [and] the holy of holies. 
\v 4 The holy portion of the land shall it be, for the priests the ministers of the sanctuary shall it be, who come near to minister unto the Lord; and it shall be unto them a place for houses, and a holy place for the sanctuary. 
\v 5 And five and twenty thousand [rods] in length, and ten thousand in breadth, shall also belong unto the Levites, the servants of the house, for themselves, as a possession, with twenty chambers. 
\v 6 And as the possession of the city shall ye assign five thousand rods broad, and five and twenty thousand long, alongside the holy oblation: unto the whole house of Israel shall it belong. 
\v 7 And the prince shall have that on the one side and on the other side of the holy oblation, and of the possession of the city, in front of the holy oblation, and in front of the possession of the city, on the west side westward, and on the east side eastward; and in length alongside one of the portions, both on the west border and on the east border. 
\v 8 As landed property shall it be his possession in Israel: and my princes shall no more wrong my people; but the land shall they give to the house of Israel according to their tribes. 
\v 9 Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Ye have done enough wrong, O princes of Israel: remove violence and robbery, and execute justice and righteousness; take away your exactions from my people, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\v 10 Just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath shall ye have. 
\v 11 The ephah and the bath shall contain the same quantity, that the bath may contain the tenth part of a chomer, and the ephah the tenth part of a chomer: after the chomer shall the measure of contents be. 
\v 12 And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs: [in pieces of] twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh. 
\v 13 This is the heave-offering that ye shall offer; The sixth part of an ephah of a chomer of wheat; and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah of a chomer of barley; 
\v 14 And the fixed portion of oil shall be after the bath of oil, the tenth part of a bath out of the cor, ten baths reckoned to the chomer; for ten baths are a chomer; 
\v 15 And one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, out of the fat pastures of Israel, for meat-offerings, and for burnt-offerings, and for peace-offerings, to make an atonement for them, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\v 16 All the people of the land shall be held bound for this heave-offering for the prince in Israel. 
\v 17 And upon the prince shall be the duty to furnish the burnt-offerings, the meat-offerings, and the drink-offerings, on the feasts, and on the new-moon days, and on the sabbaths, on all the festive seasons of the house of Israel: he himself shall prepare the sin-offering, and the meat-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings, to make an atonement in behalf of the house of Israel. 
\v 18 Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, In the first month, on the first of the month, shalt thou take a young bullock without blemish, and make an expiation for the sanctuary. 
\v 19 And the priest shall take some of the blood of the sin-offering, and put it upon the door-post of the house, and upon the four corners of the projection of the altar, and upon the door-post of the gate of the inner court. 
\v 20 And so shalt thou do on the seventh day of the month for every one that erreth, and for him that hath sinned unawares; so shall ye atone for the house. 
\v 21 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, shall ye have the passover: a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten. 
\v 22 And the prince shall prepare on that day in behalf of himself and in behalf of all the people of the land a bullock for a sin-offering. 
\v 23 And on the seven days of the feast shall he prepare a burnt-offering to the Lord, seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish on every day of the seven days; and for a sin-offering a he-goat on every day. 
\v 24 And as a meat-offering an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram shall he prepare, and a hin of oil for each ephah. 
\v 25 In the seventh month, on the fifteenth day of the month, on the feast, shall he prepare the like during the seven days, both the sin-offering, as also the burnt-offering, and the meat-offering, and the oil. 
\c 46  
\p
\v 1 Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, The gate of the inner court that looketh toward the east shall remain locked the six working days; but on the sabbath day shall it be opened, and on the new-moon day shall it be opened. 
\v 2 And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate, from without, and shall stand by the door-post of the gate, and the priests shall prepare his burnt-offering and his peace-offerings, and he shall bow himself down at the threshold of the gate, and he shall then go forth; but the gate shall not be locked until the evening. 
\v 3 And the people of the land shall bow themselves down at the door of this same gate on the sabbaths and on the new-moons before the Lord. 
\v 4 And the burnt-offering which the prince is to offer unto the Lord, shall be on the sabbath-day six sheep without blemish, and a ram without blemish; 
\v 5 And as a meat-offering an ephah for the ram, and for the sheep a meat-offering as his hand may be able to give, and a hin of oil for every ephah. 
\v 6 And on the day of the new moon, a young bullock without blemish, and six sheep and a ram; without blemish shall they be. 
\v 7 And an ephah for the bullock, and an ephah for the ram, shall he prepare as a meat-offering, and for the sheep according as his means may reach, and a hin of oil for every ephah. 
\v 8 And when the prince doth enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of the gate, and by the same way shall he go forth. 
\v 9 But when the people of the land come before the Lord on the appointed feasts, he that entereth in by the way of the north gate to bow himself down shall go out by the way of the south gate; and he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go out by the way of the north gate: he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in; but by that opposite to him shall he go out. 
\v 10 And as for the prince—in the midst of them, when they go in, shall he go in; and when they go out, shall they go out [together]. 
\v 11 And on the feasts and on the appointed festivals shall the meat-offering be an ephah for each bullock, and an ephah for each ram, and for the sheep as his hand may be able to give, and a hin of oil for every ephah. 
\v 12 And when the prince doth prepare as a voluntary gift a burnt-offering, or a peace-offering, as a voluntary gift unto the Lord: then shall be opened for him the gate that looketh toward the east, and he shall prepare his burnt-offering and his peace-offering, as he usually doth on the sabbath-day; and he shall go out, and the gate shall be locked after his going out. 
\v 13 And a sheep of the first year without blemish shalt thou prepare as a burnt-offering every day unto the Lord: morning by morning shalt thou prepare it. 
\v 14 And as a meat-offering shalt thou prepare with it, morning by morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third of a hin of oil, to mingle with the fine flour—a meat-offering unto the Lord, as ordinances for ever continually. 
\v 15 Thus shall they prepare the sheep, and the meat-offering, and the oil, morning by morning, as a continual burnt-offering. 
\v 16 Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, If the prince make gift unto any one of his sons, it is his inheritance, it shall belong to his sons: it shall be their possession as their inheritance. 
\v 17 But if he make a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants: then shall it remain his to the year of freedom, when it shall return to the prince; but his inheritance shall only remain for his sons. 
\v 18 But the prince shall not take any thing from the inheritance of the people, to wrong them out of their possession: out of his own possession can he give an inheritance to his sons; in order that not one of my people be deprived of his possession. 
\v 19 And then he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers for the priests, which looked toward the north: and, behold, there was a place by the back wall on the west side. 
\v 20 And he said unto me, This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass-offering and the sin-offering, where [also] they shall bake the meat-offering; so as not to carry the same out into the outer court, to mingle with the people. 
\v 21 Then did he lead me forth into the outer court, and caused me to pass along the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court there was a court. 
\v 22 In the four corners of the court there were uncovered courts of forty cubits in length and thirty in breadth: there was one measure for all these four in the corners. 
\v 23 And there was a shelf of masonry round about in them, round about all these four, and it was furnished with hearths for boiling under the shelves round about. 
\v 24 Then said he unto me, These are the places of those that boil, where the servants of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people. 
\c 47  
\p
\v 1 And he brought me back again unto the door of the house: and, behold, water was issuing out from under the threshold of the house eastward; for the front of the house stood toward the east; and the water came down from under [the threshold], from the right side of the house, to the south of the altar. 
\v 2 Then did he bring me out by the way of the gate northwards and led me about the way without unto the outer gate by the way that looked eastward: and, behold, the water was running on the right side. 
\v 3 When the man went forth eastward, having the measuring-line in his hand, he measured a thousand cubits, and he led me through the water, the water reaching to the ankles. 
\v 4 Again he measured a thousand [cubits], and led me through the water, the water reaching to the knees. Again he measured a thousand [cubits], and led me through, the water reaching to the loins. 
\v 5 And he measured again a thousand [cubits], it being a stream that I could not wade through; for the water was increased, being water fit to swim in, a stream that could not be waded through. 
\v 6 And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen this: Then did he lead me, and caused me to return to the bank of the stream. 
\v 7 Now when I returned, behold, there were at the banks of the stream very many trees, on the one side and on the other. 
\v 8 Then said he unto me, These waters issue out toward the eastern district, and go down into the plain, and fall into the sea, [the waters] being carried forth into the sea, so that the waters shall be healed. 
\v 9 And it shall come to pass, that every thing that liveth, which moveth, whithersoever the double-stream shall come, shall live: and the fish shall be [therein] in great abundance; for when this water shall have come thither, [the waters of the sea] shall be healed, and every thing shall live whither the stream cometh. 
\v 10 And it shall come to pass, that the fishers shall stand by it; from 'En-gedi even unto 'En-'eglayim, there shall be places for the spreading out of nets: after their various kinds shall the fish thereof be, like the fish of the great sea, exceedingly many. 
\v 11 But its swamps and its lagoons shall not be healed, for [the production of] salt are they destined. 
\v 12 And by the stream upon its banks, on this side and on that side, shall grow up all kinds of trees for food, the leaves of which shall not fade, and the fruit of which shall not come to an end, every month shall they bring forth new ripe fruit; because its water is that which issueth out of the sanctuary; and their fruit shall serve for food, and their leaves for remedies. 
\v 13 Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, This shall be the boundary, whereby ye shall divide out the land unto the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph shall have two portions. 
\v 14 And ye shall inherit it, every one like the other, [the land] concerning which I lifted up my hand to give it unto your fathers: and this land shall fall unto you for an inheritance. 
\v 15 And this shall be the boundary of the land: On the north side, from the great sea, the road to Chethlon, as far as to Zedad; 
\v 16 Chamath, Berothah, Sibrayim, which is between the boundary of Damascus and the boundary of Chamath; Chazar-hattichon, which is by the boundary of Chavran. 
\v 17 And the boundary shall be from the sea to Chazar-'enon, the boundary of Damascus, and the northern part on the north, and the boundary of Chamath. And this is the north side. 
\v 18 And the east side shall ye measure between Chavran and Damascus [on the one side], and between Gil'ad and the land of Israel [on the other side] by the Jordan, from the [north] boundary unto the east sea. And this is the east side. 
\v 19 And the south side; on the south, from Thamar even to the waters of contention at Kadesh, toward the brook [flowing] into the Great Sea. And this is the south side on the south. 
\v 20 And the west side shall be the great sea from the [southern] boundary, as far as straight up to Chamath. This is the west side. 
\v 21 And ye shall divide this land among yourselves according to the tribes of Israel. 
\v 22 And it shall come to pass, that ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance among yourselves, and to the strangers that sojourn in the midst of you, who shall have begotten children in the midst of you; and they shall be unto you as the native born among the children of Israel: with you shall they obtain an inheritance in the midst of the tribes of Israel. 
\v 23 And it shall come to pass that in whatever tribe the stranger sojourneth, there shall ye give him his inheritance, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\c 48  
\p
\v 1 Now these are the names of the tribes: At the edge, on the north side, along the road on the way to Chethlon, as far as Chamath, Chazar-'enan, the boundary of Damascus northward, alongside of Chamath, there shall be from the east side to the west for Dan one portion. 
\v 2 And by the boundary of Dan, from the east side unto the west side, for Asher one portion. 
\v 3 And by the boundary of Asher, from the east side even unto the west side, for Naphtali one portion. 
\v 4 And by the boundary of Naphtali, from the east side unto the west side, for Menasseh one portion. 
\v 5 And by the boundary of Menasseh, from the east side unto the west side, for Ephraim one portion. 
\v 6 And by the boundary of Ephraim, from the east side even unto the west side, for Reuben one portion. 
\v 7 And by the boundary of Reuben, from the east side unto the west side, for Judah one portion. 
\v 8 And by the boundary of Judah, from the east side unto the west side, shall be the oblation which ye shall set aside of five and twenty thousand rods in breadth, and in length as one of the other parts, from the east side unto the west side: and the sanctuary shall be in the midst of it. 
\v 9 The oblation that ye shall set aside unto the Lord shall be in length five and twenty thousand [rods], and in breadth ten thousand. 
\v 10 And to these shall belong the holy oblation,—namely to the priests, toward the north, five and twenty thousand rods [in length], and on the west ten thousand in breadth, and on the east ten thousand in breadth, and on the south five and twenty thousand in length: and the sanctuary of the Lord shall be in the midst of it. 
\v 11 Unto the priests, that are sanctified, of the sons of Zadok, who have kept my charge, who went not astray when the children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray. 
\v 12 To them shall thus belong the portion set aside of the oblation of the land as a most holy thing by the boundary of the Levites. 
\v 13 And the Levites shall have alongside the boundary of the priests five and twenty thousand rods in length, and in breadth ten thousand; the whole in length five and twenty thousand, and in breadth ten thousand. 
\v 14 But they shall not sell aught thereof, or exchange, or alienate this first portion of the land; for it is holy unto the Lord. 
\v 15 And the five thousand rods, that are left in the breadth, with a length of five and twenty thousand, shall be an unconsecrated land for the city, for dwelling, and for an open space: and the city shall be in the midst thereof. 
\v 16 And these shall be its measures: The north side four thousand and five hundred [rods], and the south side four thousand and five hundred, and on the east side four thousand and five hundred, and the west side four thousand and five hundred. 
\v 17 And the open space of the city shall be toward the north two hundred and fifty [rods], and toward the south two hundred and fifty, and toward the east two hundred and fifty, and toward the west two hundred and fifty. 
\v 18 And the produce of the residue in length alongside the holy oblation ten thousand rods eastward, and ten thousand westward, that which is alongside the holy oblation, shall be for food unto the laborers of the city. 
\v 19 And the laborers of the city, men taken out of all the tribes of Israel, shall till it. 
\v 20 All the oblation, five and twenty thousand [rods] by five and twenty thousand square, shall ye set apart as the holy oblation, with the possession of the city. 
\v 21 And the residue shall belong to the prince, on the one side and on the other of the holy oblation, and of the possession of the city, alongside of the five and twenty thousand of the oblation toward the eastern boundary, and westward alongside the five and twenty thousand toward the western boundary, alongside the portions [of the tribes]; for the prince [shall it be]: and so shall be the holy oblation; and the sanctuary of the house shall be in the midst thereof. 
\v 22 And both the possession of the Levites, and the possession of the city, shall be in the midst of that which belongeth to the prince: between the boundary of Judah and the boundary of Benjamin, shall be for the prince. 
\v 23 As for the rest of the tribes, from the east side unto the west side, shall be for Benjamin one portion. 
\v 24 And by the boundary of Benjamin, from the east side unto the west side, for Simeon one portion. 
\v 25 And by the boundary of Simeon, from the east side unto the west side, for Issachar one portion. 
\v 26 And by the boundary of Issachar, from the east side unto the west side, for Zebulun one portion. 
\v 27 And by the boundary of Zebulun, from the east side unto the west side, for Gad one portion. 
\v 28 And by the boundary of Gad, on the southern side toward the south, shall be the boundary from Thamar unto the waters of contention of Kadesh, unto the brook by the Great Sea. 
\v 29 This is the land which ye shall divide by lot for an inheritance to the tribes of Israel, and these are their allotted divisions, saith the Lord Eternal. 
\v 30 And these are the outlines of the city: On the north side, five hundred and four thousand rods, by the measure. 
\v 31 And of the gates of the city, being after the names of the tribes of Israel, shall be three gates on the north: the gate of Reuben one, the gate of Judah one, the gate of Levi one. 
\v 32 And on the east side, five hundred and four thousand rods, with three gates: namely, the gate of Joseph one, the gate of Benjamin one, the gate of Dan one. 
\v 33 And the south side, five hundred and four thousand rode by the measure, with three gates: the gate of Simeon one, the gate of Issachar one, the gate of Zebulun one. 
\v 34 The west side, five hundred and four thousand rods, with their three gates: the gate of Gad one, the gate of Asher one, the gate of Naphtali one. 
\v 35 All around it shall be eighteen thousand rods: and the name of the city shall be from that day “The Lord is there.”
