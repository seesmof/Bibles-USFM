\v 2 For Judah became the mightiest of his brothers, and the prince descended from him: while the first-birthright belonged to Joseph,— 
\v 3 The sons of Reuben the first-born of Israel were, Chanoch, and Pallu, Chezron, and Carmi. 
\v 4 The sons of Joel: Shema'yah his son, Gog his son, Shim'i his son,

\v 10 And in the days of Saul they made war with the Hagarenes, who fell by their hand; and they dwelt in their tents in the whole front of the land to the east of Gil'ad. 
\v 11 And the children of Gad dwelt alongside of them, in the land of Bashan as far as Salchah. 
\v 12 Joel the chief, and Shapham the next, and Ja'nai, and Shaphat in Bashan. 
\v 13 And their brethren according to their family divisions were, Michael, and Meshullam, and Sheba', and Jorai, and Ya'kan, and Zia', and 'Eber, seven.

\v 18 The sons of Reuben, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Menasseh, of valiant men, men able to bear shield and sword, and to draw the bow, and practised in war, were four and forty thousand seven hundred and sixty, that went out to the army. 
\v 19 And they made war with the Hagarenes, and Jetur, and Naphish, and Nodab. 
\v 20 And they obtained help against them, and the Hagarenes were delivered into their hand, and all that were with them; for to God they cried in the battle, and he was entreated by them; because they put their trust in him. 
\v 21 And they led away captive their cattle: of their camels fifty thousand, and of sheep two hundred and fifty thousand, and of asses two thousand, and of human beings one hundred thousand. 
\v 22 For there fell down many slain; because the war was of God. And they dwelt in their stead until the exile. 
\v 23 And the children of the half tribe of Menasseh dwelt in the land: from Bashan unto Ba'al-chermon and Senir and mount Chermon were they numerous. 
\v 24 And these were the heads of their family divisions: namely, 'Epher, and Yish'i, and Eliel, and 'Azriel, and Jeremiah, and Hodavyah, and Jachdiel, mighty men of valor, famous men, [and] heads of their family divisions. 
\v 25 But they trespassed against the God of their fathers, and went astray after the gods of the people of the land, whom God had destroyed from before them. 
\v 26 And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul the king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgath-pilnesser the king of Assyria, and he carried them into exile, even the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Menasseh, and brought them unto Chalach, and Chabor, and Hara, and to the river Gozan, even until this day.

\v 1 So all Israel were recorded by their genealogies, and, behold, they are written in the book of the Kings of Israel; but [the men of] Judah were carried away into exile to Babylon for their unfaithfulness.

\v 23 Both they and their children had the oversight over the gates of the house of the Lord, [namely,] the house of the tabernacle, as watches. 
\v 24 On four quarters were the gatekeepers, toward the east, the west, the north, and the south. 
\v 25 And their brethren, who were in their villages, had to come after every seven days from time to time in common with these. 
\v 26 For in [their] trust were these four chief gatekeepers— these Levites, and they were [appointed] over the chambers and treasuries of the house of God. 
\v 27 And they lodged round about the house of God; because upon them rested the duty of watching, and they had the supervision of the opening thereof each and every morning. 
\v 28 And some of them had the charge of the vessels for the service; for by number did they bring them in, and by number did they carry them out. 
\v 29 Some of them also were appointed over the vessels, and over all the vessels of the sanctuary, and over the fine flour, and the wine, and the oil, and the frankincense, and the spices.

\v 33 But these the singers, the chiefs of the divisions of the Levites, remained in the chambers free of service; for day and night were they obliged to engage in that work. 
\v 34 These are the chiefs of the divisions of the Levites, being the chiefs for their generations: these dwelt at Jerusalem. 
\v 35 And in Gib'on dwelt the father of Gib'on, Je'iel; and the name of his wife was Ma'achah;

\v 43 And Moza begat Bin'a; !!and Rephayah his son, El'assah his son, Azel his son.

\c 10  
\p
\v 1 Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled before the Philistines, and there fell down [many] slain on mount Gilboa'. 
\v 2 And the Philistines pursuing them overtook Saul and his sons; and the Philistines smote Jonathan, and 'Abinadab, and Malkishua', the sons of Saul. 
\v 3 And the battle was heavy against Saul, and he was found by the archers, and he was greatly in dread of the archers. 
\v 4 And Saul said to his armor-bearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and wantonly ill-use me. But his armor-bearer would not; for he was greatly afraid: wherefore Saul took the sword and fell upon it. 
\v 5 And when the armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, then fell he likewise on the sword, and died. 
\v 6 Thus died Saul and his three sons; and all his household died together. 
\v 7 And when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw that they had fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead: they forsook their cities, and fled, and the Philistines came and dwelt in them. 
\v 8 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the Philistines came to strip the slain; and they found Saul and his sons fallen on mount Gilboa'. 
\v 9 And they stripped him, and they carried away his head, and his armor, and sent them into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish it to their idols, and to the people. 
\v 10 And they put his armor in the house of their gods, and his skull they fastened in the temple of Dagon. 
\v 11 And when all Yabesh-gil'ad heard all the Philistines had done to Saul: 
\v 12 Then arose all the valiant men, and carried away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Yabesh; and they buried their bones under the terebinth in Yabesh, and they fasted seven days. 
\v 13 And [so] died Saul for his unfaithfulness which he had committed against the Lord, because of the word of the Lord which he had not kept, and also for asking one of a familiar spirit to inquire of the same; 
\v 14 And had not inquired of the Lord: therefore he slew him, and turned over the kingdom unto David the son of Jesse. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 Then did all Israel gather themselves unto David unto Hebron, saying Behold, thy bone and thy flesh are we. 
\v 2 Already yesterday and even before, even when Saul was king, thou wast he that led out and brought in Israel; and the Lord, thy God, said unto thee, Thou shalt indeed feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be truly a chief over my people Israel. 
\v 3 Thus came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the Lord; and they anointed David as king over Israel, according to the word of the Lord through means of Samuel. 
\v 4 And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus; and there were the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land. 
\v 5 And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come in hither. Nevertheless David captured the strong-hold of Zion, the same is the City of David. 
\v 6 And David said, Whosoever doth smite the Jebusites at first shall be head and chief. Then did Joab the son of Zeruyah go up at first, and became head-man. 
\v 7 And David dwelt in the castle: therefore they called it, “The City of David.” 
\v 8 And he built the city round about, even from the Millo as far as the surrounding district, and Joab repaired the rest of the city. 
\v 9 And David want on, and became greater and greater, and the lord of hosts was with him. 
\v 10 These also are the principals of the mighty men whom David had, who held firmly with him in his kingdom, with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the Lord concerning Israel. 
\v 11 And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had: Jashoh'am, the son of Chachmoni, the chief of the captains, who lifted up his spear against three hundred slain at one time. 
\v 12 And after him was El'asar the son of Dodo, the Achochite, who was one of the three mighty men. 
\v 13 He was with David at Pass-dammim, and the Philistines were gathered together there to battle, and there was a piece of ground full of barley; and the people had fled from before the Philistines. 
\v 14 And they placed themselves in the midst of that piece [of ground], and they delivered it, and smote the Philistines: and the Lord helped [them] with a great victory. 
\v 15 And these three, the chiefs of the thirty, went down to the rock to David, to the cave of 'Adullam; and the camp of the Philistines was pitched in the valley of Rephaim. 
\v 16 And David was then in the strong-hold, and an outpost of the Philistines was then at Beth-lechem. 
\v 17 And David longed, and said, Oh that some one would bring me water to drink out of the well of Beth-lechem, which is by the gate! 
\v 18 And the three broke through the camp of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lechem, which was by the gate, and carried it, and brought it to David; but David would not drink thereof, and poured it out unto the Lord. 
\v 19 And he said, Far be it from me, before my God, that I should do this: shall I drink the blood of these men that went at the risk of their lives? for at the risk of their lives did they bring it; and thus he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men. 
\v 20 And Abshai the brother of Joab was the chief of these three; and he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain, and had a name among the three. 
\v 21 Of the three, he was more honored than the two, wherefore he became their captain; he nevertheless attained not unto the three [in prowess]. 
\v 22 Banayah the son of Jehoyada', the son of a valiant man, great in many acts, of Kah-zeel: he it was that smote the two lion-like heroes of Moab; he also went down and smote a lion in the midst of a pit on a day when it snowed. 
\v 23 And he smote an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian's hand was a spear like a weaver's beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and he snatched the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear. 
\v 24 These things did Benayah the son of Jehoyada'; and he had a name among the mighty men. 
\v 25 Behold, he was indeed more honored than the thirty; but he attained not to the first three. And David appointed him over his private council. 
\v 26 And the mighty men of the armies were, 'Assahel the brother of Joab, Elchanan the son of Dodo of Beth-lechem. 
\v 27 Shammoth the Harorite, Chelez the Pelonite, 
\v 28 'Ira the son of 'Ikkesh the Theko'ite, Abi'ezer the 'Antothite, 
\v 29 Sibbechai the Chushathite, 'Ilai the Achochite, 
\v 30 Maharai the Netophathite, Cheled the son of Ba'anah the Netophathite, 
\v 31 Ithai the son of Ribai of Gib'ah, of the children of 'Benjamin, Benayah the Pir'athonite. 
\v 32 Churai of the Nachale-Ga'ash, Abiel the 'Arbathite, 
\v 33 'Azmaveth the Bacharumite, Elyachba the Sha'albonite, 
\v 34 Bnai-hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shage the Hararite. 
\v 35 Achiam the son of Sachar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur, 
\v 36 Chepher the Mecherathite, Achiyah the Pelonite. 
\v 37 Chezro the Carmelite, Na'arai the son of Ezbai, 
\v 38 Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibchar the son of Hagri, 
\v 39 Zelek the 'Ammonite, Nachrai the Berothite, the armor bearer of Joab the son of Zeruyah, 
\v 40 'Ira the Yithrite, Gareb the Yithrite, 
\v 41 Uriyah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Achlai, 
\v 42 'Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a chief of the Reubenites, and with him were thirty [men]. 
\v 43 Chanan the son of Ma'achah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite. 
\v 44 'Uzziya the 'Ashterathite, Shama' and Je'iel the sons of Chothan the 'Aro'erite, 
\v 45 Jedi'ael the son of Shimri, and Jocha his brother, the Thizite, 
\v 46 Eliel the Machavite, and Jerihal, and Joshavyah, the son of Elna'am, and Yithmah the Moabite, 
\v 47 Eliel, and 'Obed, and Ja'assiel the Mezobayite. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 And these are those that came to David to Ziklag, while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish: and they were among the mighty men, confederates for the war, 
\v 2 Who were armed with bows, and could use both the right and the left hand in [hurling] stones and shooting arrows with the bow, even of the brethren of Saul out of Benjamin. 
\v 3 The chiefs were Achi'ezer, then Joash, the sons of Hashema'ab the Gib'athite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of 'Azmaveth; and Berachah, and Jehu the 'Anthothite, 
\v 4 And Yishma'yah the Gib'onite, a mighty man among the thirty, and over the thirty; and Jeremiah, and Jachaziel, and Jochanan, and Jozabad the Gederathite, 
\v 5 El'uzai, and Jerimath, and Be'alyah, and Shemaryahu, and Shephatyahu, the Chariphite, 
\v 6 Elkanah, and Yishiyahu, and 'Azarel, and Jo'ezer, and Jashob'am, the Korchites, 
\v 7 And Jo'elah, and Zebadyah, the sons of Jerocham of Gedor. 
\v 8 And of the Gadites there separated themselves unto David into the strong-hold in the wilderness mighty men of valor, and men of the army for the war, that could handle shield and lance, whose faces were like the faces of lions, and were as the roebucks upon the mountains in swiftness. 
\v 9 'Ezer was the chief, 'Ohadiah the second, Eliab the third, 
\v 10 Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth. 
\v 11 'Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh, 
\v 12 Jochanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth, 
\v 13 Jirmiyahu the tenth, Machbanai the eleventh. 
\v 14 These were of the sons of Gad, the chiefs of the army, one of the least could fight with a hundred, and the greatest with a thousand. 
\v 15 These are those that passed over the Jordan in the first month, when it had overflowed all its banks; and they put to flight all the men of the valleys, both toward the east, and toward the west. 
\v 16 And there came some of the children of Benjamin and of Judah as far as the strong-hold unto David. 
\v 17 And David went out to meet them, and commenced and said unto them. If ye be come for peace unto me, to help me, my heart shall be inclined toward you to unite with you; but if it be to betray me to my adversaries while there is no violence in my hands, then may the God of our fathers look on and decide it. 
\v 18 Then a spirit invested 'Amassai, the chief of the captains, [who said,] Thine are we, David, and with thee, O son of Jesse: peace, peace be unto thee, and peace be to every one that helpeth thee; for thy God helpeth thee. Then David received them, and placed them at the head of the troop. 
\v 19 And some of Menasseh went over to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle; but he helped them not; for upon consultation did the lords of the Philistines send him away, saying, With our heads will he go over to his master Saul. 
\v 20 As he was going over to Ziklag, there went over to him of Menasseh, 'Adnach, and Jozabad, and Jedi'ael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zillethai, captains of the thousands that belonged to Menasseh. 
\v 21 And they were those that helped David against the band [of 'Amelekites]; for they were all mighty men of valor, and they became officers in the army. 
\v 22 For all the time, day by day, people used to come to David to help him, until the camp became great, like the camp of God. 
\v 23 And these are the numbers of the heads of those ready armed for the host that came to David to Hebron, to turn over the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the order of the Lord. 
\v 24 The children of Judah that bore shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred, ready armed for the host. 
\v 25 Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valor for the host, seven thousand and one hundred. 
\v 26 Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred. 
\v 27 And Jehoyada' was the leader of the family of Aaron, and with him were three thousand and seven hundred. 
\v 28 Also Zadok, a young man, mighty of valor, and his family division twenty and two chiefs. 
\v 29 And of the children of Benjamin, the brethren of Saul, three thousand; for till that time the greatest part of them had kept the charge of the house of Saul. 
\v 30 And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred, mighty men of valor, men of fame in their family divisions. 
\v 31 And of the half tribe of Menasseh eighteen thousand, who had been expressed by name, to come to make David king. 
\v 32 And of the children of Issachar, those who had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do,—their heads were two hundred; and all their brethren were ready at their order. 
\v 33 Of Zebulun, such as went forth to the host, arrayed for battle, with all manner of weapons of war, fifty thousand; and these were ready to place themselves in battle array with an undivided heart. 
\v 34 And of Naphtali one thousand captains, and with them were with shield and spear thirty and seven thousand. 
\v 35 And of the Danites arrayed for battle twenty and eight thousand and six hundred. 
\v 36 And of Asher, such as went forth to the host to put themselves in battle array, forty thousand. 
\v 37 And from the other side of the Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Menasseh, with all manner of weapons of the host for war, one hundred and twenty thousand. 
\v 38 All these men of war, that placed themselves in battle array, came with an entire heart to Hebron, to make David King over all Israel; and also all the rest of Israel were of one heart to make David king. 
\v 39 And they were there with David three days eating and drinking; for their brethren had prepared for them. 
\v 40 And also those that were nigh unto them, as far as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought in bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, food made of meal, cakes of figs, and bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep in abundance; for there was joy in Israel. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 And David consulted with the officers of the thousands and hundreds, and with every leader. 
\v 2 And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, if it seem good unto you, and if it be of the Lord our God, let us send widely about unto our brethren who are left in all the lands of Israel, and with them unto the priests and Levites who are in their cities and open districts, that they may gather themselves together unto us. 
\v 3 And let us bring round the ark of our God to us; for we have inquired not at it in the days of Saul. 
\v 4 And all the congregation said that this should be done; for the king was right in the eyes of all the people. 
\v 5 So David assembled all Israel together, from Shichor of Egypt even unto the entrance of Chemath, to bring the ark of God from Kiryath-ye'arim. 
\v 6 And David went up, with all Israel, to Ba'alah, [that is] to Kiryath-ye'arim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the Lord, that dwelleth between the cherubim, whose name is called [on it]. 
\v 7 And they conveyed the ark of God in a new wagon out of the house of Abinadab: and 'Uzza and Achyo guided the wagon. 
\v 8 And David and all Israel played before God with all their might, and with singing, and on harps, and on psalteries, and on tambourines, and with cymbals, and with trumpets. 
\v 9 And when they came as far as the threshing-floor of Kidon, 'Uzza put forth his hand to take hold of the ark; for the oxen shook it. 
\v 10 And the anger of the Lord was kindled against 'Uzza, and he smote him, because he had put forth his hand toward the ark: and he died there before God. 
\v 11 And it was grievious to David, because the Lord had suddenly taken away 'Uzza; and he called that place Perez-'uzza [[Breach of 'Uzza]] until this day. 
\v 12 And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring home to me the ark of God? 
\v 13 So David removed not the ark unto himself into the city of David, but had it carried round into the house of 'Obed-edom the Gittite. 
\v 14 And the ark of God remained in the house of 'Obed-edom, in his house, three months. And the Lord blessed the house of 'Obed-edom, and all that belonged to him. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1 And Churam the king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and trees of cedars, and masons and carpenters, to build him a house. 
\v 2 And David felt conscious that the Lord had established him as king over Israel; for his kingdom was exalted on high, because of his people Israel. 
\v 3 And David took yet more wives at Jerusalem; and David begat more sons and daughters. 
\v 4 And these are the names of the children that he had in Jerusalem: Shammua', and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon, 
\v 5 And Yibchar, and Elishua', and Elpalet, 
\v 6 And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Yaphia', 
\v 7 And Elishama', and Be'elyada', and Eliphalet. 
\v 8 But when the Philistines heard that David had been anointed as king over all Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David: and David heard of it, and went out against them. 
\v 9 And the Philistines came and spread themselves out in the valley of Rephaim. 
\v 10 And David asked counsel of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into my hand? And the Lord said unto him, Go up; and I will deliver them into thy hand. 
\v 11 And they came up to Ba'al-perazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken down my enemies through my hand as a breach [is made] by water: therefore they called the name of that place Ba'al-perazim. 
\v 12 And they left behind there their gods, and David gave the order, and they were burnt with fire. 
\v 13 And the Philistines [came] once again, and spread themselves out in the valley. 
\v 14 And David asked again counsel of God; and God said unto him, Thou shalt not go up after them: turn about from them, and come upon them opposite the mulberry-trees, 
\v 15 And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of walking on the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt go out to battle; for God will be gone forth before thee to smite the camp of the Philistines. 
\v 16 And David did as God had commanded him; and they smote the camp of the Philistines from Gib'on as far as Gezer. 
\v 17 And the fame of David went out into all the lands; and the Lord laid the dread of him upon all the nations. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1 And [David] made himself houses in the city of David, and he prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent. 
\v 2 Then said David, None shall carry the ark of God but the Levites; for of them hath the Lord made choice to carry the ark of God, and to minister unto him for ever. 
\v 3 And David assembled all Israel to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the Lord unto its place, which he had prepared for it. 
\v 4 And David gathered together the children of Aaron, and the Levites. 
\v 5 Of the sons of Kehath: Uriel the chief, and his brethren one hundred and twenty. 
\v 6 Of the sons of Merari: 'Assayah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty. 
\v 7 Of the sons of Gershom: Joel the chief, and his brethren one hundred and thirty. 
\v 8 Of the sons of Elizaphan: Shema'yah the chief, and his brethren two hundred. 
\v 9 Of the sons of Hebron: Eliel the chief, and his brethren eighty. 
\v 10 Of the sons of 'Uzziel: 'Amminadab the chief, and his brethren one hundred and twelve. 
\v 11 And David called for Zadok and Ebyathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, 'Assayah, and Joel, Shema'yah, and Eliel, and 'Amminadab, 
\v 12 And he said unto them, Ye are the chiefs of the family divisions of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, ye and your brethren, and bring up the ark of the Lord the God of Israel unto [the place which] I have prepared for it. 
\v 13 For, because ye [did] it not at the first, the Lord our God made a breach among us; because we had not sought him after the prescribed manner. 
\v 14 So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the Lord the God of Israel. 
\v 15 And the children of the Levites bore the ark of God, as Moses had commanded according to the word of the Lord, on their shoulders, by means of barrows placed upon them. 
\v 16 And David said to the chiefs of the Levites to appoint their brethren the singers with instruments of music, psalteries and harps and cymbals, to sing aloud, by lifting up the voice for joy. 
\v 17 So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel, and of his brethren, Assaph the son of Berechyahu, and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushayahu; 
\v 18 And with them their brethren of the second degree, Zecharyahu, Ben, and Ja'aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jechiel, and 'Unni, Eliab, and Benayahu, and Ma'asseyahu, and Matthithyahu, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneyahu, and 'Obed-edom, and Je'iel, the gatekeepers. 
\v 19 Namely, the singers, Heman, Assaph, and Ethan, to play aloud with cymbals of copper; 
\v 20 And Zechariah, and 'Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jechiel, and 'Unni, and Eliab, and Ma'asseyahu, and Benayahu, with psalteries on 'Alamoth; 
\v 21 And Matthithyahu, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneyahu, and 'Obed-edom, and Je-iel, and 'Azazyahu, with harps on the Sheminith to play as leaders. 
\v 22 And Kenanyahu was the chief of the Levites in conducting the singing: he instructed in conducting the singing, because he was skilful. 
\v 23 And Berechyah and Elkanah were gatekeepers for the ark. 
\v 24 And Shebanyahu, and Joshaphat, and Nethanel, and 'Amassai, and Zecharyahu, and Benayahu, and Eli'ezer, the priests, did blow on the trumpets before the ark of God; and 'Obed-edom and Jechiyah were gatekeepers for the ark. 
\v 25 And it was David, with the elders of Israel, and the officers over the thousands, who went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the house of 'Obed-edom with joy. 
\v 26 And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams. 
\v 27 And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and [so were] all the Levites that carried the ark, and the singers, and Kenanyahu the chief in conducting the singing of the singers; but David had also upon him an ephod of linen. 
\v 28 Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the Lord with shouting, and with the sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, playing aloud on psalteries and harps. 
\v 29 And it happened, as the ark of the covenant of the Lord came as far as the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked through the window, and saw king David dancing and playing, and she despised him in her heart. 
\c 16  
\p
\v 1 And they brought in the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it; and they offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before God. 
\v 2 And when David had made an end of offering the burnt-offerings and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the Lord. 
\v 3 And he dealt out to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine. 
\v 4 And he placed before the ark of the Lord several of the Levites as ministers, and to chaunt hymns, and to give praise and thanks unto the Lord the God of Israel: 
\v 5 Assaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah; Je'iel, and Shemiramoth, and Jechiel, and Matthithyah, and Eliab, and Benayahu, and 'Obed-edom; and Je'iel with psalteries and with harps; but Assaph played aloud with the cymbals. 
\v 6 And Benayahu and Jachaziel the priests were with the trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God. 
\v 7 On that day—then did David appoint for the first time to give thanks to the Lord through means of Assaph and his brethren. 
\v 8 O give thanks unto the Lord; call on his name; make known among the people his deeds. 
\v 9 Sing unto him, sing praises unto him: speak of all his wonderful works. 
\v 10 Glorify yourselves in his holy name: let the heart of those rejoice that seek the Lord. 
\v 11 Inquire after the Lord and his strength: seek his presence evermore. 
\v 12 Remember his wonderful works which he hath done, his tokens, and the decrees of his mouth; 
\v 13 O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his elect. 
\v 14 He is the Lord our God: over all the earth are his decrees. 
\v 15 Remember ye for ever his covenant, the word which he hath commanded to the thousandth generation. 
\v 16 Which he covenanted with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac; 
\v 17 And which he established unto Jacob as a statute, unto Israel as an everlasting covenant; 
\v 18 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, as the portion of your inheritance; 
\v 19 When ye were but few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it. 
\v 20 And when they wandered from one nation to another, and from one kingdom to another people: 
\v 21 He suffered no man to oppress them; yea, he reproved kings for their sake. 
\v 22 Saying, “Touch not my anointed, and do my prophets no harm.”— 
\v 23 Sing unto the Lord all ye lands: announce from day to day his salvation. 
\v 24 Relate among the nations his glory: among all the people his wonderful deeds. 
\v 25 For great is the Lord, and greatly praised; and he is to be feared above all gods. 
\v 26 For all the gods of the people are idols: but the Lord hath made the heavens. 
\v 27 Majesty and honor are in his presence, strength and gladness are in his place. 
\v 28 Ascribe unto the Lord, O ye families of people, ascribe unto the Lord glory and strength. 
\v 29 Ascribe unto the Lord the glory due unto his name; take up an offering, and come into his presence; bow down before the Lord in the beauty of holiness. 
\v 30 Tremble before him, all ye lands! Also the world standeth firmly, that it be not moved. 
\v 31 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; and let men say among the nations, The Lord reigneth. 
\v 32 Let the sea roar, with all that filleth it: let the fields rejoice, and all that is therein. 
\v 33 Then shall the trees of the forest sing joyfully at the presence of the Lord; because he cometh to judge the earth. 
\v 34 O give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good; because unto everlasting endureth his kindness. 
\v 35 And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the nations, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, to glorify ourselves in thy praise. 
\v 36 Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel from everlasting even unto everlasting. And all the people said, Amen, and praise unto the Lord. 
\v 37 And he left there in charge before the ark of the covenant of the Lord Assaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, at the work of every day on its day, 
\v 38 And 'Obed-edom with their brethren, sixty and eight, and 'Obed-edom the son of Jeduthun and Chossah to be gatekeepers; 
\v 39 And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the Lord, in the high-place that was at Gib'on, 
\v 40 To offer burnt-offerings unto the Lord upon the altar of the burnt-offering continually at morning and at evening, and this in accordance with all that is written in the law of the Lord which he had commanded concerning Israel; 
\v 41 And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were selected who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the Lord, because unto everlasting endureth his kindness; 
\v 42 And with them, with Heman and Jeduthun, the trumpets and cymbals to play aloud, and the musical instruments of God; and the sons of Jeduthun to be for the service at the gate. 
\v 43 And all the people went every man to his house; and David turned about to bless his house. 
\c 17  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass, when David dwelt in his house, that David said unto Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in a house of cedar, while the ark of the covenant of the Lord is under curtains. 
\v 2 And Nathan said unto David, All that is in thy heart do; for God is with thee. 
\v 3 And it came to pass during that night, that the word of God came unto Nathan, saying, 
\v 4 Go and say unto David my servant, Thus hath said the Lord, Not thou shalt build for me the house to dwell in; 
\v 5 For I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel even until this day; but have been [moving] from tent to tent, and from [one] tabernacle [to another]. 
\v 6 In all the places where I moved about among all Israel, did I speak a word to any one of the judges of Israel, whom I had ordained to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built for me a house of cedar? 
\v 7 Now therefore, thus shalt thou say unto my servant, to David, Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, I took thee away from the sheepcote, from behind the flocks, to be a ruler over my people Israel; 
\v 8 And I have been with thee withersoever thou didst go, and I have cut off all thy enemies from thy presence, and I have made thee a name; like the name of the great men who are on the earth; 
\v 9 And I have procured a place for my people Israel, and I have planted them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and be no more troubled; and that the children of wickedness shall not waste them any more, as aforetimes, 
\v 10 And [as it was] since the time that I ordained judges to be over my people Israel; and I have humbled all thy enemies; and now I tell thee that the Lord will build for thee a house. 
\v 11 And it shall come to pass, that, when thy days will be completed that thou must go [to sleep] with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, who shall be of thy sons, and I will establish his kingdom. 
\v 12 He it is that shall build for me a house, and I will establish his throne for ever. 
\v 13 I too will be to him as a father, and he shall indeed be unto me as a son: and my kindness will I not cause to depart from him, as I caused it to depart from him that was before thee; 
\v 14 But I will place him firmly in my house and in my kingdom for evermore; and his throne shall be established for ever. 
\v 15 In accordance with all these words, and in accordance with all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David. 
\v 16 Then went king David in and sat down before the Lord, and he said, Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me as far as hitherward? 
\v 17 And this was [yet] too small a thing in thy eyes, O God, and thou hast spoken concerning thy servant's house for a distant time, and hast regarded me as though I belonged to the rank of a man of high degree, O Lord God. 
\v 18 What can David add yet more [to speak] unto thee of the honor of thy servant? since thou knowest well thy servant. 
\v 19 O Lord, for the sake of thy servant, and in accordance with thy own heart, hast thou done all this great thing, to make known all these great things. 
\v 20 O Lord, there is none like thee, and there is no god beside thee, in accordance with all that we have heard with our ears. 
\v 21 And who is like thy people Israel, the only nation on the earth which God went to redeem for himself as a people, to acquire for thyself a name for great and terrible deeds, by driving out nations from before thy people, which thou hadst redeemed out of Egypt? 
\v 22 And thou hast instituted thy people Israel unto thyself as a people for ever; and thou, Lord, art indeed become their God. 
\v 23 And now, O Lord, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be verified for ever, and do as thou hast spoken. 
\v 24 Yea, let it be verified, and let thy name be magnified unto everlasting, that men may say, The Lord of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God for Israel; and may the house of David thy servant be established before thee. 
\v 25 For thou, O my God, hast revealed to the ear of thy servant, that thou wilt build for him a house; therefore hath thy servant found himself able to pray before thee. 
\v 26 And now, O Lord, thou art the [true] God, and thou hast spoken concerning thy servant this goodness: 
\v 27 And now hast thou been pleased to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee; for thou, O Lord, hast blessed, and [it will remain] blessed for ever.

\p
\v 1 And it came to pass after this, that David smote the Philistines, and humbled them; and he took Gath and its dependent towns out of the hand of the Philistines. 
\v 2 And he smote Moab, and the Moabites became David's servants, bringing presents. 
\v 3 David also smote Hadar'ezer the king of Zobah, at Chamath, as he went to establish his dominion at the river Euphrates. 
\v 4 And David captured from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand men on foot; and David hamstringed all the chariot-teams, but reserved of them a hundred chariot-teams. 
\v 5 And the Syrians of Damascus came to aid Hadar'ezer the king of Zobah, when David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men. 
\v 6 Then did David put [garrisons] in Syria of Damascus, and the Syrians became unto David servants, bringing presents. And the Lord helped David withersoever he went. 
\v 7 And David took the quivers of gold that were on the servants of Hadar'ezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. 
\v 8 And from Tibchath, and from Kun, cities of Hadar'ezer, did David take exceedingly much copper; thereof made Solomon the copper sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of copper. 
\v 9 And when To'u the king of Chamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadar'ezer the king of Zobah: 
\v 10 Then did he send Hadoram his son unto king David, to ask him after his well-being, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadar'ezer, and smitten him: for Hadar'ezer had been engaged in wars with To'u; and [he had with him] all manner of vessels of gold and silver and copper. 
\v 11 Also these did king David sanctify unto the Lord, with the silver and the gold that he had carried away from all the nations, from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of 'Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from 'Amalek. 
\v 12 And Abshai the son of Zeruyah smote of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand [men]. 
\v 13 And he put garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites became servants unto David. And the Lord helped David withersoever he went. 
\v 14 And David reigned over all Israel, and he did what is just and right unto all his people. 
\v 15 And Joab the son of Zeruyah was over the army, and Jehoshaphat the son of Achilud, recorder. 
\v 16 And Zadok the son of Achitub, and Abimelech the son of Ebyathar, were [the] priests; and Shavsha was scribe; 
\v 17 And Benayahu the son of Jehoyada' was over the Kerethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were the first at the side of the king. 
\c 19  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass after this, that Nachash the king of the children of 'Ammon died, and his son became king in his stead. 
\v 2 And David said, I will show kindness unto Chanun the son of Nachash, because his father showed kindness unto me. And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. And the servants of David came unto the land of the children of 'Ammon to Chanun, to comfort him. 
\v 3 And the princes of the children of 'Ammon said unto Chanun, Doth David honor thy father in thy eyes, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee in order to search out, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land? 
\v 4 Chanun thereupon took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle as far as the hip-bone, and sent them away. 
\v 5 And some people went and told David concerning these men. And he sent [persons] to meet them: because the men were greatly ashamed; and the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beard be grown, and then return. 
\v 6 And when the children of 'Ammon saw that they were become in bad odor with David, Chanun and the children of 'Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire for themselves from Mesopotamia, and from Syria-ma'achah, and from Zobah, chariots and horsemen. 
\v 7 And they hired for themselves thirty and two thousand [warriors in] chariots, and the king of Ma'achah and his people: and they came and encamped before Medeba. And the children of 'Ammon gathered themselves together out of their cities, and came to the battle. 
\v 8 And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the army [and] the mighty men. 
\v 9 And the children of 'Ammon came out, and put themselves in battle array at the entrance of the city: and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field. 
\v 10 When now Joab saw that the front of battle was against him before and behind, he made a selection from all the chosen men of Israel, and arrayed himself against the Syrians. 
\v 11 And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abshai his brother, and they arrayed themselves against the children of 'Ammon. 
\v 12 And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then shalt thou bring me help; but if the children of 'Ammon be too strong for thee, then will I help thee. 
\v 13 Be strong, and let us strengthen ourselves in behalf of our people, and in behalf of the cities of our God, and may the Lord do that which seemeth good in his eyes. 
\v 14 And Joab drew nigh and the people that were with him in front of the Syrians unto the battle, and they fled from before him. 
\v 15 And when the children of 'Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, then did they also fly before Abshai his brother, and entered into the city. And Joab went back to Jerusalem. 
\v 16 And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel, they sent messengers, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the army of Hadar'ezer went before them. 
\v 17 And when it was told to David, he gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came up with them, and arrayed himself against them. So when David had arrayed himself against the Syrians [for] battle, they fought with him. 
\v 18 And the Syrians fled from before Israel: and David slew of the Syrians [the men of] seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand men on foot, and Shophach the captain of the army he put to death. 
\v 19 And when the vassals of Hadar'ezer saw that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with David, and served him: and the Syrians would not help the children of 'Ammon any more. 
\c 20  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass, at the time of the return of the same season of the year, at the time when kings go forth, that Joab led out the power of the army, and destroyed the country of the children of 'Ammon, and he came and besieged Rabbah. But David remained behind at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and pulled it down. 
\v 2 And David took the crown of Malkam from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and thereon a precious stone; and it was set on the head of David: and the booty of the city he brought out in great abundance. 
\v 3 And the people that were therein he brought forward, and cut them with saws, and with iron threshing-wagons, and with axes; and thus did David unto all the cities of the children of 'Ammon; and David returned then with all the people unto Jerusalem. 
\v 4 And it came to pass after this, that there arose a battle at Gezer with the Philistines: then smote Sibbechai the Chushathite Sippai, one of the children of the Rapha; and they were humbled. 
\v 5 And there was again a battle with the Philistines, when Elchanan the son of Yair smote Lachmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam. 
\v 6 And there was again a battle at Gath, where was a man of [great] stature, whose fingers and toes were six on each [hand and foot], four and twenty [in all]; and he also was born to the Rapha. 
\v 7 And he defied Israel; but Jonathan the son of Shim'a the brother of David smote him. 
\v 8 These were born unto the Rapha in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants. 
\c 21  
\p
\v 1 And the Accuser stood up against Israel, and incited David to count Israel. 
\v 2 And David said to Joab, and to the princes of the people, Go, number Israel from Beer-sheba' even to Dan, and bring their number to me, that I may know it. 
\v 3 Then said Joab, May the Lord add unto his people, how many soever they be, a hundred-fold more: are they not all, my lord the king, my lord's servants? why then will my lord require this thing? why shall it be a cause of guiltiness for Israel? 
\v 4 Nevertheless the king's word remained firm against Joab; and Joab went out, and moved about throughout all Israel, and came [back] to Jerusalem. 
\v 5 And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto David: and there were [in] all Israel a thousand times thousand and one hundred thousand men that drew the sword: and [of] Judah were four hundred and seventy thousand men that drew the sword. 
\v 6 But Levi and Benjamin did he not count among them: for the king's word was abominable to Joab. 
\v 7 And this thing was displeasing in the eyes of God, and he smote Israel. 
\v 8 And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing; but now, I beseech thee, cause the iniquity of thy servant to pass away; for I have acted very foolishly. 
\v 9 And the Lord spoke unto Gad, David's seer, saying, 
\v 10 Go and speak unto David, saying, Thus hath said the Lord, Three things do I offer thee: choose for thyself one of them, and I will do it unto thee. 
\v 11 So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus hath said the Lord, Select for thyself, 
\v 12 Whether there shall be three years famine; or three months, to be destroyed before thy adversaries, so that the sword of thy enemies overtake thee; or that during three days the sword of the Lord, even the pestilence, shall be in the land, and an angel of the Lord destroying throughout all the boundaries of Israel? And now reflect what word I shall bring back to him that hath sent me. 
\v 13 And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall then into the hand of the Lord; for his mercies are very great; but let me not fall into the hand of man. 
\v 14 So the Lord sent a pestilence in Israel, and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men. 
\v 15 And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it; but as he was destroying, the Lord looked on, and he bethought himself of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough: now stay thy hand. And the angel of the Lord was standing by the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite. 
\v 16 And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the Lord standing between the earth and the heavens, with his sword drawn in his hand, stretched out over Jerusalem. Then fell David, with the elders wrapt in sackcloth, upon their faces. 
\v 17 And David said unto God, Was it not I that ordered to count the people? and I am the one that have sinned and have done evil indeed; but these sheep, what have they done? O Lord my God, let thy hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father's house, but not against thy people, that there should be a plague. 
\v 18 And the angel of the Lord spoke to Gad to say to David, that David should go up, to erect an altar unto the Lord on the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite. 
\v 19 And David went up by the word of Gad, which he had spoken in the name of the Lord. 
\v 20 And when Ornan turned back, and saw the angel, then did he and his four sons with him hide themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat. 
\v 21 And as David came up to Ornan, Ornan looked up and saw David; and he went out of the threshing-floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground. 
\v 22 Then said David to Ornan, “Grant me the site of this threshing-floor, that I may build thereon an altar unto the Lord: for the full price shalt thou give it unto me, so that the plague may be stayed from the people.” 
\v 23 And Ornan said unto David, Take it for thyself, and let my lord the king do what is good in his eyes: lo, I give the oxen for burnt-offerings, and the threshing-rollers for wood, and the wheat for the meat-offering; the whole do I give [thee]. 
\v 24 And king David said to Ornan, No: but I will surely buy it at the full value; for I will not take what is thine for the Lord, so as to offer burnt-offerings without paying therefore. 
\v 25 So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight. 
\v 26 And David built there an altar unto the Lord, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and he called on the Lord: and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt-offering. 
\v 27 And the Lord spoke to the angel, and he put back his sword into its sheath. 
\v 28 At that time when David saw that the Lord had answered him on the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then did he sacrifice there. 
\v 29 But the tabernacle of the Lord, which Moses had made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt-offering, were at that time in the high-place at Gib'on. 
\v 30 But David was not able to go before it to inquire of God; for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the Lord. 
\c 22  
\p
\v 1 And David said, This is the house of the Lord the [true] God, and this is the altar for the burnt-offering for Israel. 
\v 2 And David ordered to gather together the strangers that were in the land of Israel: and he appointed [them] to be masons to hew cut stones to build the house of God. 
\v 3 And iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the joinings, did David prepare; and copper in abundance, [which] could not be weighed; 
\v 4 Also cedar-trees [which] could not be counted; for the Zidonians and the Tyrians had brought cedar-trees in abundance to David. 
\v 5 And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be built [in honor] of the Lord must be exceedingly great, for fame and for glory throughout all the countries: I will therefore make preparation for it. So David made abundant preparation before his death. 
\v 6 And he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build a house for the Lord the God of Israel. 
\v 7 And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build a house unto the name of the Lord my God; 
\v 8 But there came concerning me the word of the Lord, saying, Blood in abundance hast thou shed, and great wars hast thou made: thou shalt not build a house unto my name, because much blood hast thou shed upon the earth before me. 
\v 9 Behold, a son will be born to thee, he it is who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies on every side; for Solomon [[The Peaceful]] shall be his name, and peace and quietness will I bestow on Israel in his days. 
\v 10 He it is who shall build a house unto my name; and he shall be unto me as a son, and I will be unto him as a father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever. 
\v 11 Now, my son, may the Lord be with thee, that thou mayest prosper, and build the house of the Lord thy God, as he hath spoken concerning thee. 
\v 12 Only may the Lord give thee intelligence and understanding, and give thee charge over Israel, so that thou mayest observe the law of the Lord thy God. 
\v 13 Then wilt thou prosper, if thou observe to practise the statutes and the ordinances which the Lord commanded Moses concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; be not afraid, nor be thou dismayed. 
\v 14 And, behold, during my affliction have I prepared for the house of the Lord one hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand times thousand talents of silver; and of copper and iron [as much as] cannot be weighed; for in [such] abundance was it: and wood and stone have I prepared; and thou must add thereto. 
\v 15 Moreover there are with thee in abundance workmen, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of skilful men for every kind of work. 
\v 16 The gold, the silver, and the copper, and the iron cannot be numbered: arise, [therefore,] and be doing, and may the Lord be with thee. 
\v 17 And David gave a charge to all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, [saying,] 
\v 18 Behold the Lord your God is with you; and he hath given you rest on every side; for he hath given up into my hand the inhabitants of the land, and the land is subdued before the Lord, and before his people. 
\v 19 Now direct your heart and your soul to seek the Lord your God; and arise, and build ye the sanctuary of the Lord the [true] God, [in order] to bring the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built unto the name of the Lord. 
\c 23  
\p
\v 1 And when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel. 
\v 2 And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites. 
\v 3 And then were numbered the Levites from thirty years old and upward: and their number by their polls, of men, was thirty and eight thousand. 
\v 4 Of these were twenty and four thousand to superintend the work of the house of the Lord; and six thousand were officers and judges; 
\v 5 And four thousand were gatekeepers: and four thousand those who praised the Lord with the instruments which I have made, to praise therewith. 
\v 6 And David divided them into divisions after the sons of Levi, after Gershon, Kehath, and Merari. 
\v 7 Of the Gershunites: La'dan, and Shim'i. 
\v 8 The sons of La'dan: The chief was Jechiel, and Zetham, and Joel, three. 
\v 9 The sons of Shim'i: Shelomith, and Chaziel, and Haran, three. These were the chiefs of the families of La'dan. 
\v 10 And the sons of Shim'i were, Jachath, Zina, and Je'ush, and Beri'ah. These four were the sons of Shim'i. 
\v 11 And Jachath was the chief, and Zizah the second; but Je'ush and Beri'ah had not many sons: therefore were they accounted as one family division in the numbering. 
\v 12 The sons of Kehath: 'Amram, Yizhar, Hebron, and 'Uzziel, four. 
\v 13 The sons of 'Amram, Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was set apart, to sanctify him as most holy, he with his sons for ever, to burn incense before the Lord, to minister unto him, and to bless in his name for ever. 
\v 14 But as regardeth Moses the man of God, his sons were named after the tribe of Levi. 
\v 15 The sons of Moses were, Gershom, and Eli'ezer. 
\v 16 Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel was the chief. 
\v 17 And the sons of Eli'ezer were, Rechahyah the chief. And Eli'ezer had no other sons; but the sons of Rechahyah became exceedingly numerous. 
\v 18 Of the sons of Yizhar, was Shelomith the chief. 
\v 19 The sons of Hebron: Jeriyahu the chief, Amaryah the second, Jachaziel the third, and Jekam'am the fourth. 
\v 20 The sons of 'Uzziel: Michah the chief, and Yishiyah the second. 
\v 21 The sons of Merari: Machli, and Mushi. The sons of Machli: El'azar, and Kish. 
\v 22 And El'azar died, and had no sons, but daughters; and the sons of Kish, their brethren, took them [for wives]. 
\v 23 The sons of Mushi: Machli, and 'Eder, and Jeremoth, three. 
\v 24 These were the sons of Levi after their family divisions, even the chiefs of the families, as they were counted by numbering the names after their polls, that did the work for the service of the house of the Lord, from twenty years old and upward. 
\v 25 For David said, The Lord the God of Israel hath given rest unto his people, and he dwelleth in Jerusalem for evermore. 
\v 26 And also the Levites are no more bound to carry the tabernacle, and all its vessels for the service thereof. 
\v 27 Therefore by the last words of David were there numbered of the Levites those who were from twenty years old and above; 
\v 28 Because their station was to be at the side of the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the Lord, in the courts, and in the chambers, and by the purification of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God; 
\v 29 And for the shew-bread, which was put in rows, and for the fine flour for meat-offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for that which is baked in the pan, and for that which is sodden, and for all manner of dry and wet measure; 
\v 30 And to stand every morning to thank and praise the Lord, and so also at evening, 
\v 31 And at all the offering of burnt-offerings unto the Lord on the sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the appointed feasts, according to the number, and after the manner prescribed for them, continually before the Lord; 
\v 32 And that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren, in the service of the house of the Lord. 
\c 24  
\p
\v 1 And the divisions of the sons of Aaron were: The sons of Aaron were Nadab, and Abihu, El'azar, and Ithamar. 
\v 2 But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and they had no children: and El'azar and Ithamar became priests. 
\v 3 And David divided them off with Zadok of the sons of El'azar', and Achimelech of the sons of Ithamar, to their office in their service. 
\v 4 And the sons of El'azar were found more numerous in the chiefs of males than the sons of Ithamar; and they divided them accordingly. Of the sons of El'azar there were sixteen chiefs of the family divisions, and of the sons of Ithamar, eight for their family divisions. 
\v 5 And they divided them off by lot, both the first and the last; for the governors of the sanctuary, and governors [of the house] of God, were from the sons of El'azar, and from the sons of Ithamar. 
\v 6 And Shema'yah the son of Nethanel the scribe, one of the Levites, wrote them down before the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Achimelech the son of Ebyathar, and the chiefs of the families of the priests and Levites: one family division being drawn of El'azar, and one being equally drawn of Ithamar. 
\v 7 And there came out the first lot for Jehoyarib, for Jeda'yah the second, 
\v 8 For Charim the third, for Se'orim the fourth, 
\v 9 For Malkiyah the fifth, for Miyamin the sixth. 
\v 10 For Hakkoz the seventh, for Abiyah the eighth, 
\v 11 For Jeshua' the ninth, for Shechanyahu the tenth, 
\v 12 For Elyashib the eleventh, for Jakim the twelfth, 
\v 13 For Chuppah the thirteenth, for Jeshehah the fourteenth, 
\v 14 For Bilgah the fifteenth, for Immer the sixteenth, 
\v 15 For Chezir the seventeenth, for Happizzez the eighteenth, 
\v 16 For Pethachyah the nineteenth, for Ezekiel the twentieth. 
\v 17 For Jachin the one and twentieth, for Gamul the two and twentieth, 
\v 18 For Delayahu the three and twentieth, for Ma'azyahu the four and twentieth. 
\v 19 This was their office in their service to come into the house of the Lord, according to the manner prescribed to them, under the supervision of Aaron their father, as the Lord the God of Israel had commanded him. 
\v 20 And of the rest of the sons of Levi there were, of the sons of 'Amram: Shubael. Of the sons of Shubael: Jechdeyahu. 
\v 21 Concerning Rechabyahu, of the sons of Rechabyahu the chief was Yishiyah. 
\v 22 Of the Yisharites was Shelomoth: of the sons of Shelomoth was Jachath. 
\v 23 And the sons [of Hebron]: Jeriyah, Amaryahu the second, Jachaziel the third, Jekam'am the fourth. 
\v 24 [Of] the sons of 'Uzziel, Michah: of the sons of Michah, Shamir. 
\v 25 The brother of Michah was Yishiyah; of the sons of Yishiyah, Zecharyahu. 
\v 26 The sons of Merari were Machli and Mushi: the sons of Ja'aziyahu, Beno. 
\v 27 The sons of Merari by Ja'aziyahu: Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur, and 'Ibri. 
\v 28 Of Machli: El'azar, who had no sons. 
\v 29 Of Kish: The son of Kish was Jerachmeel. 
\v 30 And the sons of Mushi were Machli, and 'Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites after their family divisions. 
\v 31 These likewise cast lots in the same manner as their brethren the sons of Aaron in the presence of king David, and Zadok, and Achimelech, and the chiefs of the families of the priests and Levites, even the principal of the families equally with his youngest brother. 
\c 25  
\p
\v 1 David also divided off with the chiefs of the host for the service of the sons of Assaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, those who uttered praise [accompanied] with harps, with psalteries, and with cymbals: and their number was of the men [that did] the work in their service. 
\v 2 Of the sons of Assaph: Zaccur, and Joseph, and Nethanyah, and Asharelah, the sons of Assaph under the supervision of Assaph, who uttered praise under the supervision of the king. 
\v 3 Of Jeduthun, the sons of Jeduthun: Gedalyahu, and Zeri, and Jesha'yahu, Chashahyahu, and Matthithyahu, six, under the supervision of their father Jeduthun, who uttered praise with a harp, in order to give thanks and to utter praise unto the Lord. 
\v 4 Of Heman, the sons of Heman: Bukkiyahu, Matthanyahu, 'Uzziel, Shebuel, and Jerimoth, Chananyah, Chanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, and Romamti-'ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and Machaz'oth; 
\v 5 All these sons of Heman the king's seer in the words of God, were to lift up the horn. And God gave to Heman fourteen sons and three daughters. 
\v 6 All these were under the supervision of their father at the singing in the house of the Lord, with cymbals, psalteries, and harps, for the service of the house of God, under the supervision of the king, Assaph, Jeduthun, and Heman. 
\v 7 And their number, with their brethren that were practised in singing unto the Lord, even all that were acquainted [therewith], was two hundred eighty and eight. 
\v 8 And they cast lots, division against [division], the small well as the great, the one acquainted with his business together with the scholar. 
\v 9 And there came forth the first lot for Assaph for Joseph; Gedalyahu was the second, he with his brethren and sons, being twelve: 
\v 10 The third was Zaccur, his sons, and his brethren, being twelve: 
\v 11 The fourth was for Yizri, his sons, and his brethren, being twelve; 
\v 12 The fifth was Nethanyahu, his sons, and his brethren, being twelve: 
\v 13 The sixth was Bukkiyahu, his sons, and his brethren, being twelve: 
\v 14 The seventh was Jessarelah, his sons, and his brethren, being twelve; 
\v 15 The eighth was Jesha'yahu, his sons, and his brethren, being twelve; 
\v 16 The ninth was Matthanyahu, his sons, and his brethren, being twelve; 
\v 17 The tenth was Shim'i, his sons, and his brethren, being twelve; 
\v 18 The eleventh was 'Asarel, his sons, and his brethren, being twelve;

\v 1 Concerning the divisions of the gatekeepers [who were] of the Korchites: Meshelemyahu the son of Kore, of the sons of Assaph. 
\v 2 And Meshelemyahu had sons: Zecharyahu the first-born, Jedi'ael the second, Zebaiyahu the third, Jathniel the fourth, 
\v 3 Elam the fifth, Jehochanan the sixth, Elyeho'enal the seventh, 
\v 4 And 'Obed-edom had sons: Shema'yah the first-born, Jehosabad the second, Joach the third, and Sachar the fourth, and Nethanel the fifth, 
\v 5 'Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, Pe'ulthai the eighth; for God had blessed him. 
\v 6 Also unto Shema'yah his son there were born sons, that were rulers for the house of their father; for they were mighty men of valor. 
\v 7 The sons of Shema'yah were 'Othni, and Rephael, and 'Obed, [and] Elsahad, his brothers [were] valiant men, Elihu, and Semachyahu. 
\v 8 All these were of the sons of 'Obed-edom: they and their sons and their brethren were valiant men in strength for the service, being sixty and two [descendants] of 'Obed-edom. 
\v 9 And Meshelemyahu had sons and brethren, valiant men, eighteen. 
\v 10 Also Chossah, of the children of Merari, had sons: Shimri the chief, for [though] he was not the first-born, yet his father made him the chief; 
\v 11 Chilkiyahu the second, Tehalyahu the third, Zecharyahu the fourth; all the sons and brethren of Chossah were thirteen. 
\v 12 These divisions of the gatekeepers, after the chief men, had the watch along with their brethren, to minister in the house of the Lord. 
\v 13 And they cast lots, the small as well as the great, according to their family divisions, for each and every gate. 
\v 14 And the lot at the east fell for Shelemyahu. And for Zecharyahu his son, an intelligent counsellor, they cast lots, and his lot came out at the north. 
\v 15 For 'Obed-edom at the south; and to his sons [was assigned] the house of Assuppim. 
\v 16 For Shuppim and for Chossah at the west, by the gate Shallecheth, on the ascending causeway, watch alongside of watch. 
\v 17 At the east were six Levites, at the north four for every day, at the south four for every day, and for [the house of] Assuppim always two. 
\v 18 At the Parbar on the west, four at the causeway, and two at the Parbar. 
\v 19 These are the divisions of the gatekeepers of the sons of the Korchites, and of the sons of Merari. 
\v 20 And of the Levites, Achiyah was over the treasuries of the house of God, and over the treasuries of the holy things. 
\v 21 [As concerning] the sons of La'dan, the sons of the Gershunites of La'dan, the chiefs of the families of La'dan the Gershunite, were the Jechielites. 
\v 22 The sons of Jechieli, Zetham, and Joel his brother, were over the treasuries of the house of the Lord. 
\v 23 Of the 'Amramites, of the Yizharites, of the Hebronites, and of the 'Uzzielites, 
\v 24 [Was] even Shebuel the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, superintendent of the treasuries. 
\v 25 And his brethren by Eli'ezer: Rechabyahu his son, and Jesha'yahu his son, and Joram his son, and Zichri his son, and Shelomoth his son. 
\v 26 This Shelomoth and his brethren were over all the treasuries of the holy things, which king David had sanctified, together with the chiefs of the family divisions, the captains over the thousands and the hundreds, and the captains of the army. 
\v 27 Out of the wars, and out of the booty did they sanctify to maintain the house of the Lord. 
\v 28 And all that Samuel the seer, and Saul the son of Kish, and Abner the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Zeruyah, had sanctified, whatsoever [any one] had sanctified, was under the supervision of Shelomoth and of his brethren. 
\v 29 Of the Yizharites were Kenanyahu and his sons for the outward business over Israel, for officers and judges. 
\v 30 Of the Hebronites were Chashabyahu and his brethren, valiant men, a thousand and seven hundred [in number], appointed over the affairs of Israel on this side of the Jordan to the west, for all the business of the Lord, and for the service of the king. 
\v 31 Of the Hebronites was Jeriyah the chief, for the Hebronites, according to their generations by families. In the fortieth year of the reign of David were they inquired into, and there were found among them mighty men of valor at Ja'zer of Gil'ad. 
\v 32 And his brethren, valiant men, were two thousand and seven hundred chiefs of families: and king David appointed them over the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Menasseh, for every matter pertaining to God, and the affairs of the king. 
\c 27  
\p
\v 1 And [these are] the children of Israel after their number; [to wit,] the chiefs of the family divisions and the captains of the thousands and the hundreds, and their officers that served the king in every matter of the divisions, that came in and went out month by month, throughout all the months of the year, every division being twenty and four thousand. 
\v 2 Over the first division for the first month was Jashob'am the son of Zabdiel; and in his division were twenty and four thousand. 
\v 3 [He] of the children of Perez was the chief of all the captains of the armies for the first month. 
\v 4 And over the division of the second month was Dodai the Achochite, and of his division was Mikloth also the ruler; and in his division were twenty and four thousand. 
\v 5 The third captain of the army for the third month was Benayahu the son of Jehoyada', the priest, the chief; and in his division were twenty and four thousand. 
\v 6 This Benayahu was the mighty among the thirty, and [set] over the thirty'; and of his division was 'Ammizabad his son. 
\v 7 The fourth for the fourth month was 'Assahel the brother of Joab, with Zebadyah his son after him; and in his division were twenty and four thousand. 
\v 8 The fifth for the fifth month was the captain Shamhuth the Yizrachite; and in his division were twenty and four thousand. 
\v 9 The sixth for the sixth month was 'Ira the son of 'Ikkesh the Theko'ite; and in his division were twenty and four thousand. 
\v 10 The seventh for the seventh month was Chelez the Pelonite, of the children of Ephraim; and in his division were twenty and four thousand. 
\v 11 The eighth for the eighth month was Sibbechai the Chushathite, of the Zarchites: and in his division were twenty and four thousand. 
\v 12 The ninth for the ninth month was Abi'ezer the 'Anthothite, of Benjamin; and in his division were twenty and four thousand. 
\v 13 The tenth for the tenth month was Maharai the Netophathite, of the Zarchites; and in his division were twenty and four thousand. 
\v 14 The eleventh for the eleventh month was Benayah the Pir'athonite, of the children of Ephraim; and in his division were twenty and four thousand. 
\v 15 The twelfth for the twelfth month was Cheldai the Netophathite, of 'Othniel; and in his division were twenty and four thousand. 
\v 16 Moreover over the tribes of Israel: Of the Reubenites was ruler Eli'ezer the son of Zichri; of the Simeonites, Shephatyahu the son of Ma'achah; 
\v 17 Of the Levites, Chashabyah the son of Kamuel; of [the sons of] Aaron, Zadok; 
\v 18 Of Judah, Elihu, one of the brothers of David; of Issachar, 'Omri the son of Michael; 
\v 19 Of Zebulun, Yishma'yahu the son of 'Obadyahu; of Naphtali, Jerimoth the son of 'Azriel; 
\v 20 Of the children of Ephraim, Hoshea, the son of 'Azazyahu; of the half tribe of Menasseh, Joel the son of Pedayahu; 
\v 21 Of the half tribe of Menasseh in Gil'ad, Yiddo the son of Zecharyahu; of Benjamin, 'Ja'assiel the son of Abner; 
\v 22 Of Dan, 'Azarel the son of Jerocham. These were the princes of the tribes of Israel. 
\v 23 But David took not their number from twenty years old and under; because the Lord had said he would multiply Israel like the stars of the heavens. 
\v 24 Joab the son of Zeruyah began to number [them]; but he finished not, and there came wrath because of it against Israel: and the number was not entered in the account of the chronicles of king David. 
\v 25 And over the king's treasures was 'Azmaveth the son of 'Adiel; and over the storehouses in the fields, in the cities, and in the villages, and in the castles, was Jehonathan the son of 'Uzziyahu. 
\v 26 And over those that did the work of the field, in the tillage of the ground, was 'Ezri the son of Kelub. 
\v 27 And over the vineyards was Shim'i the Ramathite; and over what was in the vineyards, as regardeth the supplies of wine, was Zabdi the Shiphmite. 
\v 28 And over the olive-trees and the sycamore-trees that were in the lowlands was Ba'al-chanan the Gederite: and over the supplies of oil was Jo'ash. 
\v 29 And over the herds that fed in Sharon was Shitrai the Sharonite; and over the herds that were in the valleys was Shaphat the son of 'Adlai. 
\v 30 And over the camels was Obil the Ishma'elite; and over the she-asses was Yechdeyahu the Meronothite. 
\v 31 And over the flocks was Jaziz the Hagerene. All these were the rulers of the property which belonged to king David. 
\v 32 Also Jonathan David's uncle was a counsellor, being a man of understanding and acquainted with law; and Jeshiel the son of Chachmoni was with the king's sons; 
\v 33 And Achithophel was the king's counsellor; and Chushai the Arkite was the king's friend; 
\v 34 And after Achithophel [came] Jehoyada' the son of Benayahu and Ebyathar; and the captain of the king's army was Joab. 
\c 28  
\p
\v 1 And David assembled all the princes of Israel, the princes of the tribes, and the captains of the divisions that ministered to the king, and the captains of the thousands, and the captains of the hundreds, and the rulers of all the property and the cattle of the king and of his sons, with the court-servants, and the mighty men, and with all the valiant men of the army, unto Jerusalem. 
\v 2 Then arose king David upon his feet, and said, Hear me, my brethren, and my people! I had in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and for the footstool of our God, and I had made preparations to build; 
\v 3 But God said unto me, Thou shalt not build a house unto my name; because thou art a man of war, and blood hast thou shed. 
\v 4 Yet the Lord the God of Israel made choice of me out of all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever; for of Judah had he made choice as ruler, and among the house of Judah, of the house of my father; and among the sons of my father had he pleasure in me to make [me] king over all Israel: 
\v 5 And of all my sons,—for the Lord hath given me many sons,— hath he made choice of Solomon my son, to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the Lord over Israel. 
\v 6 And he hath said unto me, Solomon thy son it is that shall build my house and my courts; for I have made choice of him to be as a son unto me, and I will be indeed to him as a father. 
\v 7 Moreover, I will firmly establish his kingdom for everlasting, if he be strong to execute my commandments and my ordinances as it is this day. 
\v 8 And now before the eyes of all Israel, the congregation of the Lord, and in the hearing of our God, [I admonish you] observe and seek for all the commandments of the Lord your God: in order that ye may keep possession of this good land, and leave it for an inheritance unto your children after you forever. 
\v 9 And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with an entire heart and with a willing soul; for all hearts doth the Lord search, and every imagination of the thoughts doth he understand; if thou seek him, he will let himself be found by thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever. 
\v 10 See now that the Lord hath made choice of thee to build a house for the sanctuary: be strong and do it. 
\v 11 Then gave David to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and of its apartments, and of its treasuries, and of upper chambers, and of its inner chambers, and of the place of the cover of the ark. 
\v 12 And the pattern of all that he had in his spirit, concerning the courts of the house of the Lord, and concerning all the chambers round about, concerning the treasuries of the house of God, and concerning the treasuries of the holy things: 
\v 13 Also concerning the divisions of the priests and the Levites, and concerning all the work of the service of the house of the Lord, and concerning all the vessels of service of the house of the Lord; 
\v 14 Concerning the golden vessels, after the weight of the gold, for all the vessels of all manner of service; concerning all the vessels of silver after the weight, for all the vessels of every kind of service; 
\v 15 Also the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and for their lamps of gold, after the weight for every candlestick, and for its lamps; and concerning the candlesticks of silver after the weight, for the candlestick, and for its lamps, according to the use of every candlestick; 
\v 16 And the gold after the weight for the tables of the rows of shewbread, for every table; and the silver for the tables of silver; 
\v 17 Also [concerning] the forks, and the bowls, and the supporters of pure gold; and concerning the golden cups after the weight for every cup; and concerning the silver cups after the weight for every cup; 
\v 18 And concerning the altar of incense the refined gold after the weight; and concerning the pattern of the chariot of the golden cherubim, which spread out [their wings], and over the ark of the covenant of the Lord. 
\v 19 All [this, said David,] was put in writing from the hand of the Lord, who gave me instruction [respecting] all the works of the pattern. 
\v 20 And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong, and of good courage, and do [the work]; fear not, and be not dismayed; for the Lord God, [yea,] my God is with thee: he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until thou have finished all the work for the service of the house of the Lord. 
\v 21 And, behold, the divisions of the priests and the Levites are there for all the service of the house of God; and with thee are in all manner of workmanship all kinds of men distinguished in wisdom, for every manner of service; and the princes and all the people are ready [to obey] all thy words. 
\c 29  
\p
\v 1 And king David said unto all the assembly, Solomon, the only son of mine whom God hath made choice of, is yet young and tender, and the work is great; because not for man is the palace to be, but for the Lord God. 
\v 2 But with all my might have I made ready for the house of my God, the gold for the things of gold, and the silver for the things of silver, and the copper for the things of copper, the iron for the things of iron, and the wood for the things of wood, onyx stones, and stones to be set, bright stones, and stones of divers colors, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance. 
\v 3 Moreover, because I have set my affection on the house of my God, have I acquired as my own property gold and silver; [and this] have I given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house: 
\v 4 Three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses; 
\v 5 All that is needed of gold and of silver, and for every manner of work [to be made] by the hands of artificers. And who [now] is willing to consecrate his hand this day unto the Lord? 
\v 6 Thereupon offered voluntarily the chiefs of the family divisions and the princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of the thousands and of the hundreds, with the supervisors of the king's work; 
\v 7 And they gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drachms, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of copper eighteen thousand talents, and of iron one hundred thousand talents. 
\v 8 And those with whom stones were found gave them to the treasury of the house of the Lord, under the supervision of Jechiel the Gershunite. 
\v 9 Then did the people rejoice, because they had voluntarily offered: for with an undivided heart did they offer to the Lord: and also king David rejoiced with great joy. 
\v 10 And David blessed the Lord before the eyes of all the congregation; and David said, Blessed be thou, O Lord the God of Israel our father, from everlasting even unto everlasting. 
\v 11 Thine, O Lord, are the greatness, and the might, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty, yea, all that is in the heavens and on the earth: thine, O Lord, is the kingdom, and thou art exalted as the head above all. 
\v 12 And riches and honor come from thee, and thou rulest over all; and in thy hand are power and might; and it is in thy hand to make great, and to give strength unto all. 
\v 13 And now, O our God, we give thanks unto thee, and praise thy glorious name. 
\v 14 For who am I, and what is my people, that we should possess the power to offer voluntarily after this sort? for from thee is every thing, and out of thy own have we given unto thee. 
\v 15 For strangers are we before thee, and sojourners, as were all our fathers: like a shadow are our days on the earth, and there is no hope [of abiding]. 
\v 16 O Lord our God! all this abundant store which we have prepared to build for thee a house for thy holy name, is out of thy own hand, and thine is all. 
\v 17 And I know, my God, that thou probest the heart, and uprightness thou receivest in favor. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart have I voluntarily offered all these things; and now thy people, that are present here, do I see with joy offering voluntarily unto thee. 
\v 18 O Lord, God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our father, preserve this for ever as the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and direct their heart firmly unto thee. 
\v 19 And unto Solomon my son do thou give an undivided heart to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all, and to build the palace, for which I have made preparation. 
\v 20 And David said to all the assembly. Bless now the Lord your God. And all the assembly blessed the Lord the God of their fathers, and bent down their heads, and prostrated themselves to the Lord, and to the king. 
\v 21 And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the Lord, and they offered burnt-offerings unto the Lord, on the morrow after that day, one thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, a thousand sheep, with their drink-offerings, and [other] sacrifices in abundance for all Israel; 
\v 22 And they ate and drank before the Lord on that day with great joy. And they declared the second time Solomon the son of David to be king, and they anointed him unto the Lord as chief ruler, and Zadok as priest. 
\v 23 Then sat Solomon on the throne of the Lord as king instead of David his father, and he was prosperous; and all Israel obeyed him. 
\v 24 And all the princes, and the mighty men, and also all the sons of king David, submitted themselves unto king Solomon. 
\v 25 And the Lord made Solomon exceedingly great before the eyes of all Israel; and he bestowed upon him a royal majesty such as had not been on any king over Israel before him. 
\v 26 Thus did David the son of Jesse reign over all Israel. 
\v 27 And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years: in Hebron he reigned seven years, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three [years]. 
\v 28 And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor: and Solomon his son became king in his stead. 
\v 29 And the acts of king David, the first and the last, behold, they are written in the history of Samuel the seer, and in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the history of Gad the seer, 
\v 30 Together with all his reign and his mighty deeds, and the times that passed over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the [various] countries.
