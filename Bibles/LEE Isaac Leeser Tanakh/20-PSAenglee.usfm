\v 1 BOOK FIRST: Happy is the man who walketh not in the council of the wicked, and standeth not in the way of sinners, and sitteth not in the seat of scorners; 
\v 2 But whose delight is in the law of the Lord, and who doth meditate in his law by day and night. 
\v 3 And he shall be like a tree planted by rivulets of water, that yieldeth its fruit in its season, and the leaf of which doth not wither; and all that he may do shall prosper. 
\v 4 Not so the wicked; but they are like the chaff which the wind driveth away. 
\v 5 Therefore shall the wicked not be able to stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. 
\v 6 For the Lord regardeth the way of the righteous; but the way of the wicked leadeth to perdition.

\v 1 Wherefore do nations rage, and people meditate a vain thing? 
\v 2 The kings of the earth raise themselves up, and rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against his anointed: 
\v 3 “Let us break asunder their bands, and cast away from us their cords.” 
\v 4 He who dwelleth in the heavens will laugh: the Lord will hold them in derision. 
\v 5 Then will he speak unto them in his anger, and in his displeasure will he terrify them. 
\v 6 [Saying,] Yet have I appointed my king upon Zion my holy mount. 
\v 7 I will announce the decree, the Lord hath said unto me, “My son art thou: I have indeed this day begotten thee. 
\v 8 Ask it of me, and I will give thee nations for an inheritance, and for thy possession the uttermost ends of the earth. 
\v 9 Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; like a potter's vessel shalt thou dash them in pieces.” 
\v 10 And now, O ye kings, be wise: take warning, ye judges of the earth. 
\v 11 Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling. 
\v 12 Do homage to the son, lest he be angry, and ye be lost on the way; for his wrath is so speedily kindled. Happy are all they that put their trust in him.

\v 1 “A psalm of David, when he fled from before Abshalom his son.” (3:2) Lord, how numerous are my assailants! how many, that rise up against me! 
\v 2 (3:3) Many say of my soul, There is no help for him with God. Selah. 
\v 3 (3:4) But thou, O Lord, art a shield around me, my glory, and he that lifteth up my head. 
\v 4 (3:5) With my voice I call unto the Lord, and he answereth me out of his holy mountain. Selah. 
\v 5 (3:6) I laid myself down and slept: I awoke; for the Lord sustaineth me. 
\v 6 (3:7) I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have placed themselves round about against me. 
\v 7 (3:8) Arise, O Lord, help me, O my God; for thou smitest all my enemies upon the cheek bone: the teeth of the wicked dost thou break. 
\v 8 (3:9) Salvation belongeth unto the Lord: thy blessing be upon thy people. Selah. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 “To the chief musician on Neginoth, a psalm of David.” (4:2) When I call, answer me, O God of my righteousness: amidst distress thou hast [ever] granted me enlargement; be gracious unto me, and hear my prayer. 
\v 2 (4:3) O ye sons of men, how long shall my glory be put to shame? [how long] will ye love vanity, will ye seek for lies? Selah. 
\v 3 (4:4) But know that the Lord hath set apart the pious for himself: the Lord will hear when I call on him. 
\v 4 (4:5) Tremble, and sin not: commune with your heart upon your bed, and be still Selah. 
\v 5 (4:6) Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the Lord. 
\v 6 (4:7) Many say, “Who will show us happiness? Let shine brightly over us the light of thy countenance, O Lord.” 
\v 7 (4:8) [But] thou hast placed more joy in my heart than at the time when their corn and their wine were increased. 
\v 8 (4:9) In peace, altogether, will I lay me down and sleep; for thou, Lord, alone, causest me to dwell in safety. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 “To the chief musician upon Nechiloth, a psalm of David.” (5:2) To my words give ear, O Lord, have regard to my mediation. 
\v 2 (5:3) Listen unto the voice of my loud cry, my King, and my God, when unto thee I pray. 
\v 3 (5:4) O Lord! in the morning do thou hear my voice: in the morning will I set in order [my prayer] before thee, and 1ook up with hope. 
\v 4 (5:5) For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: evil cannot abide with thee. 
\v 5 (5:6) The arrogant cannot stand up before thy eyes: thou hatest all workers of wickedness. 
\v 6 (5:7) Thou wilt destroy those that speak lies: the man of blood and deceit the Lord abhorreth. 
\v 7 (5:8) But as for me—in the abundance of thy kindness will I enter thy house: I will bow myself down before thy holy temple in the fear of thee. 
\v 8 (5:9) O Lord, lead me in thy righteousness because of those that regard me enviously; make straight before me thy way. 
\v 9 (5:10) For there is not in their mouth any sincerity; their inward part is full of deception; an open sepulchre is their throat: they flatter with their tongue. 
\v 10 (5:11) Condemn them, O God: let them fall through their own counsels; for the multitude of their transgressions cast them down; for they have rebelled against thee. 
\v 11 (5:12) Then will rejoice all those that put their trust in thee; for ever will they shout for joy, when thou protectest them: and then will exult in thee those that love thy name. 
\v 12 (5:13) For thou wilt bless the righteous, O Lord; as with a shield wilt thou encompass him with favor. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1 “To the chief musician on Neginoth upon Sheminith, a psalm of David.” (6:2) O Lord, correct me not in thy anger, and chastise me not in thy wrath. 
\v 2 (6:3) Be gracious unto me, O Lord; for I am withering away; heal me, O Lord; for my bones are terrified. 
\v 3 (6:4) And my soul is greatly terrified; but thou, O Lord, how long yet—? 
\v 4 (6:5) Return, O Lord, deliver my soul: help me for the sake of thy kindness. 
\v 5 (6:6) For in death men do not remember thee: in the nether world, who shall give thee thanks? 
\v 6 (6:7) I am weary with my sighing; I flood every night my bed; With my tears I moisten my couch. 
\v 7 (6:8) My eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all my assailants. 
\v 8 (6:9) Depart from me, all ye workers of wickedness; for the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping. 
\v 9 (6:10) The Lord hath heard my supplication; the Lord will accept my prayer. 
\v 10 (6:11) Ashamed and greatly terrified shall become all my enemies; they will turn round, and be made ashamed in a moment. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1 “A Shiggayon of David, which he sang unto the Lord, concerning the affairs of Cush the Benjamite.” (7:2) O Lord my God, in thee do I put my trust; save me from every one of my persecutors, and deliver me: 
\v 2 (7:3) Lest he tear like a lion my soul, rending it in pieces, with none to deliver. 
\v 3 (7:4) O Lord my God, if I have done this; if there be injustice in my hands; 
\v 4 (7:5) If I have recompensed him that was at peace with me with evil; If I have taken aught from my assailants without cause: 
\v 5 (7:6) May the enemy hotly pursue my soul, and overtake it; and tread down upon the earth my life, and cause my honor to be in the dust. Selah. 
\v 6 (7:7) Arise, O Lord, in thy anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of my enemies: and awake for me [to] the judgment that thou hast commanded. 
\v 7 (7:8) So shall the congregation of nations compass thee about: and for their sakes return thou to the height. 
\v 8 (7:9) The Lord will judge the people: judge me, O Lord, according to my righteousness, and according to my integrity [grant] me [recompense]. 
\v 9 (7:10) Oh let the evil of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just, O thou, who triest the hearts and reins, O righteous God. 
\v 10 (7:11) My protection is by God, who saveth the upright in heath. 
\v 11 (7:12) God is a righteous judge, and a God who is indignant [with the wicked] every day. 
\v 12 (7:13) If he turn not, He will whet his sword, he bendeth his bow, and maketh it ready. 
\v 13 (7:14) Also for him he prepareth the instruments of death; he fashioneth his arrows against the persecutors. 
\v 14 (7:15) Behold, he travaileth with wrong doing; but he hath conceived mischief, and bringeth forth falsehood. 
\v 15 (7:16) He hath hollowed out a pit, and dug it, and is fallen into the ditch which he hath wrought. 
\v 16 (7:17) His mischief will return upon his own head, and upon his own skull will his violence come down. 
\v 17 (7:18) I will thank the Lord according to his righteousness; and I will sing praises to the name of the Lord the Most High.

\v 1 “To the chief musician upon Gittith, a psalm of David.” (8:2) O Eternal One our Lord, how excellent is thy name on all the earth! thou who hast set thy majesty above the heavens. 
\v 2 (8:3) Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou founded [thy] might, because of thy opponents, that thou mightest bring to silence the enemy and him that seeketh vengeance. 
\v 3 (8:4) When I behold thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast established:— 
\v 4 (8:5) What is the mortal, that thou rememberest him? and the son of man, that thou thinkest of him: 
\v 5 (8:6) Yet thou hast made him but a little less than angels, and hast crowned him with honor and glory. 
\v 6 (8:7) Thou hast given him dominion over the works of thy hands; every thing hast thou placed beneath his feet: 
\v 7 (8:8) Flocks and herds altogether, and also the beasts of the field; 
\v 8 (8:9) The birds of heaven, and the fishes of the sea, whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas. 
\v 9 (8:10) O Eternal One our Lord, how excellent is thy name on all the earth! 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 “To the chief musician upon Muthlabben, a psalm of David.” (9:2) I will thank the Lord with all my heart: I will relate all thy marvelous deeds. 
\v 2 (9:3) I will rejoice and exult in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou Most High: 
\v 3 (9:4) When my enemies are turned backward, [when] they fall and perish at thy presence. 
\v 4 (9:5) For thou hast conducted my dispute and my cause; thou hast sat on the throne as a righteous judge. 
\v 5 (9:6) Thou hast rebuked nations, thou hast caused the wicked to perish, their name hast thou blotted out for ever and ever. 
\v 6 (9:7) O thou enemy, the ruins are passed away for ever, and the cities which thou hast destroyed,—lost is their memorial, yea, theirs. 
\v 7 (9:8) But the Lord will sit enthroned for ever: he hath established for giving judgment his throne. 
\v 8 (9:9) And he will judge the world with righteousness, he shall decide for the people, with equity. 
\v 9 (9:10) The Lord also will be a strong-hold for the oppressed, a strong-hold in times of distress. 
\v 10 (9:11) And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee; for thou hast not forsaken those that seek thee, O Lord. 
\v 11 (9:12) Sing praises to the Lord, who dwelleth in Zion: announce among the people his deeds. 
\v 12 (9:13) For he, that inquireth after acts of blood, hath remembered them: he hath not forgotten the cry of the afflicted. 
\v 13 (9:14) Be gracious unto me, O Lord; have regard to my affliction [coming] from those that hate me, thou who liftest me up from the gates of death: 
\v 14 (9:15) In order that I may relate all thy praises in the gates of the daughters of Zion: I will be glad in thy salvation. 
\v 15 (9:16) Sunk are nations in the ditch that they have prepared: in this net which they had laid in secret is their own foot caught. 
\v 16 (9:17) The Lord is made known: he executed justice: through the doing of his own hands is the wicked ensnared. Higgayon, Selah. 
\v 17 (9:18) The wicked shall return into hell, all the nations that are forgetful of God. 
\v 18 (9:19) For not everlastingly shall the needy be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever. 
\v 19 (9:20) Arise, O Lord; let not the mortal boast of his strength; let nations be judged before thy face. 
\v 20 (9:21) Place, O Lord, fear over them: let nations know, that they are but mortals. Selah. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1 Wherefore, O Lord, standest thou afar off? hidest thyself in times of distress? 
\v 2 In the pride of the wicked doth he hotly pursue the poor: they are seized through the plans that those have devised. 
\v 3 For the wicked boasteth of the longing of his soul, and the robber blesseth himself when he hath despised the Lord. 
\v 4 The wicked, according to the pride of his wrathfulness, [saith,] He will not require, There is no God [in] all his plans. 
\v 5 Prosperous are his ways at all times; far in the height [remain] thy punishments away from him: all his assailants—he puffeth at them. 
\v 6 He saith in his heart, I shall not be moved; I shall be for many generations, and without adversity. 
\v 7 Of the false oaths is his mouth full, and deceit and fraud: under his tongue is mischief and wickedness. 
\v 8 He sitteth in the lurking-places of the villages; in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes search for the unfortunate. 
\v 9 He lieth in wait in a secret place like a lion in his den; he lieth in wait to snatch up the poor: he snatcheth up the poor, as they draweth him into his net. 
\v 10 He croucheth, he bendeth himself, and the unfortunate fall through his might. 
\v 11 He saith in his heart, God hath forgotten; he hath hidden his face; he will never see it. 
\v 12 Arise, O Lord; O God, lift up thy hand: forget not the afflicted. 
\v 13 For what doth the wicked despise God? [why] doth he say in his heart, Thou wilt not require it? 
\v 14 Thou hast seen it: for thou beholdest mischief and despiteful acts, to requite it with thy hand: unto thee the unfortunate committeth himself; unto the fatherless hast thou [ever] been a helper. 
\v 15 Break thou the arm of the wicked; and of the bad man—thou wilt inquire for his wickedness [till] thou find none. 
\v 16 The Lord is King for ever and ever: nations are perished out of his land. 
\v 17 The longing of the afflicted dost thou hear, O Lord! thou wilt strengthen their heart, thou wilt cause thy ear to listen: 
\v 18 To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that not farther more shall be arrogant the mortal from the earth. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 “To the chief musician, by David.” In the Lord have I put my trust: how can ye say to my soul, Flee to your mountain as a bird? 
\v 2 For lo, the wicked bend their bow, they arrange their arrow upon the string, to shoot in the dark at the upright in heart. 
\v 3 For [if] the foundations be torn down, what can the righteous do? 
\v 4 The Lord is in his holy temple, the Lord hath his throne in the heavens, his eyes behold, his eyelids prove, the children of men. 
\v 5 The Lord proveth the righteous; but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth. 
\v 6 He letteth rain upon the wicked burning coals, fire and brimstone; and a glowing wind is the portion of their cup. 
\v 7 For righteous is the Lord, he loveth righteousness: his countenance doth behold the upright. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 “To the chief musician upon Sheminith, a psalm of David.” (12:2) Help, O Lord; for the pious have ceased to be; for the truthful have failed from among the children of men. 
\v 2 (12:3) Deceptively do they speak every one with his neighbor, with flattering lips, with a double heart do they speak. 
\v 3 (12:4) May the Lord cut off all flattering lips, the tongue that speaketh boastful things: 
\v 4 (12:5) Who have said, With our tongue will we be mighty; our lips are with us; who is Lord over us! 
\v 5 (12:6) Because of the oppression of the poor, because of the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the Lord: I will grant safety to him for whom the other layeth a snare. 
\v 6 (12:7) The words of the Lord are pure words, as silver refined in the crucible of earth, purified seven times. 
\v 7 (12:8) Thou, O Lord, wilt preserve them; thou wilt guard them from this generation for ever. 
\v 8 (12:9) On every side do the wicked walk about, when the vile are exalted over the sons of man. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 “To the chief musician, a psalm of David.” (13:2) How long, O Lord, wilt thou forget me continually! how long wilt thou hide thy face from me? 
\v 2 (13:3) How long shall I have to devise resolves in my soul, with grief in my heart daily? how long shall my enemy exalt himself over me? 
\v 3 (13:4) Look down, answer me, O Lord my God! enlighten my eyes, that I may not sleep the sleep of death; 
\v 4 (13:5) That my enemy may not say, I have overcome him; that my assailants may not be glad when I am moved. 
\v 5 (13:6) But I trust in thy kindness, let my heart be glad because of thy salvation: 
\v 6 I will sing unto the Lord, because he hath dealt bountifully with me. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1 “To the chief musician, by David.” The worthless fool saith in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they are abominable [in their] doings, there is none that doth good. 
\v 2 The Lord looketh down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there be one intelligent, one who seeketh for God. 
\v 3 They are all gone aside, they are altogether become corrupt: there is none that doth good, no, not even one. 
\v 4 Is there no knowledge in all the workers of wickedness? who eat up my people as they eat bread; [while] they do not call on the Lord. 
\v 5 There are they terrified in terror; for God is with the righteous generation: 
\v 6 The counsel of the poor [though] you put to shame; because the Lord is his protection. 
\v 7 Oh that some one might bring the salvation of Israel out of Zion! When the Lord bringeth back the captivity of his people, then will Jacob be glad, and Israel will rejoice. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1 “A psalm of David.” Lord, who may sojourn in thy tent? who may dwell on thy holy mount? 
\v 2 He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart; 
\v 3 That uttereth no calumny with his tongue, that doth no evil to his neighbor, and bringeth no reproach on his fellow-man; 
\v 4 In whose eyes the despicable is despised; but that honoreth those who fear the Lord; that sweareth to his own injury, and changeth not; 
\v 5 That putteth not out his money for interest, and taketh no bribe against the innocent. He that doth these things shall not be moved to eternity. 
\c 16  
\p
\v 1 “A Michtham of David.” Preserve me, O God; for I have placed my trust in thee. 
\v 2 [O my soul], thou hast said unto the Lord, Thou art my Lord: my happiness is not without thee; 
\v 3 [But] in the saints who are on the earth, and in the excellent—in them is all my delight. 
\v 4 Multiplied shall be the sorrows of those who give presents to another god: I will not pour out their drink-offerings of blood, nor bear their names upon my lips. 
\v 5 Thou, O Lord, art the portion of my inheritance, and my cup; thou hast drawn my lot. 
\v 6 My possessions are fallen in agreeable places: yea, my heritage is pleasant to me. 
\v 7 I will bless the Lord, who hath given me counsel: also in the night seasons my reins admonish me. 
\v 8 I have always set the Lord before me, that, being at my right hand, I might not be moved. 
\v 9 Therefore is rejoiced my heart, and my spirit is glad: also my flesh shall rest in safety. 
\v 10 For thou wilt not abandon my soul to the grave: thou wilt not suffer thy pious [servant] to see corruption. 
\v 11 Thou wilt let me know the path of life: fulness of joy is in thy presence; pleasures are at thy right hand for evermore. 
\c 17  
\p
\v 1 “A prayer of David.” Hear, O Lord, [the cause of] righteousness, attend unto my entreaty, give ear unto my prayer, coming from lips without deceit. 
\v 2 Let from thy presence my sentence come forth; let thy eyes behold what is right. 
\v 3 Thou hast proved my heart; thou hast thought of me in the night; thou hast refined me—thou couldst find nothing: my purpose doth not pass beyond [the words of] my mouth. 
\v 4 Among the deeds of men did I observe, by the word of thy lips, the paths of the dissolute. 
\v 5 My steps held firmly to thy tracks, [and] my footsteps did not slip. 
\v 6 I call on thee, for thou wilt answer me, O God: incline thy ear unto me, hear my speech. 
\v 7 Show marvelously thy loving-kindnesses, O thou that savest those who put their trust [in thee] from those that rise up [against them] by thy right hand. 
\v 8 Keep me as the apple of the eye; conceal me under the shadow of thy wings, 
\v 9 From the wicked that despoil me, my enemies, who, to take my life, compass me about. 
\v 10 They are enclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly. 
\v 11 On our steps they now encompass us: they direct their eyes to turn aside in the land. 
\v 12 Every man is just like a lion that is greedy to tear his prey, and like a young lion lurking in a covert. 
\v 13 Arise, O Lord, prevent him, cast him down; deliver my soul from the wicked, who is thy sword,— 
\v 14 From these men—thy hand—O Lord, from the men of this world, whose portion is in this life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy hidden treasure: they have children in plenty, and leave the rest of their substance to their babes. 
\v 15 As for me, in righteousness shall I behold thy face: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with contemplating thy likeness. 
\c 18

\v 1 “To the chief musician, by the servant of the Lord, by David, who spoke unto the Lord the words of this song on the day that the Lord had delivered him out of the power of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul; (18:2) And he said,” I ever love thee, O Lord, my strength. 
\v 2 (18:3) The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my rock, in whom I trust; my shield, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower. 
\v 3 (18:4) Praised, I cried, be the Lord, and from my enemies was I saved. 
\v 4 (18:5) The bonds of death encompassed me, and the floods of destruction made me afraid. 
\v 5 (18:6) The bonds of hell encircled me: the snares of death seized on me. 
\v 6 (18:7) [When] in my distress I called upon the Lord, and unto my God I cried: he heard from his temple my voice, and my complaint came before him, even into his ears. 
\v 7 (18:8) Then shook and trembled the earth; and the foundations of the mountains were moved; and they were shaken, because he was wroth. 
\v 8 (18:9) Smoke went up in his anger and consuming fire out of his mouth: coals flamed forth from him. 
\v 9 (18:10) And he bent the heavens, and came down: and thick darkness was under his feet: 
\v 10 (18:11) And he rode upon a cherub, and flew along, and he flitted by upon the wings of the wind. 
\v 11 (18:12) He made darkness his hiding-place, round about him as his pavilion, dark waters, thick clouds of the skies. 
\v 12 (18:13) From the brightness before him his thick clouds passed away, [with] hail-stones and coals of fire. 
\v 13 (18:14) And the Lord thundered in the heavens, and the Most High uttered forth his voice, [with] hail-stones and coals of fire. 
\v 14 (18:15) And he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot forth lightnings, and discomfited them. 
\v 15 (18:16) And then were seen the channels of the waters, and there were laid open the foundations of the world, through thy rebuke, O Lord, through the blast of the breath of thy nostrils. 
\v 16 (18:17) He stretched out from above [his hand], he took me; he drew me out from mighty waters. 
\v 17 (18:18) He delivered me from my enemy, the strong, and from those that hated me, when they were too mighty for me. 
\v 18 (18:19) They overcame me on the day of my calamity; but the Lord became my stay. 
\v 19 (18:20) And he brought me forth into a large space; he delivered me, because he had delight in me. 
\v 20 (18:21) The Lord rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the purity of my hands did he recompense me. 
\v 21 (18:22) For I have kept the ways of the Lord, and have not wickedly departed from my God. 
\v 22 (18:23) For all his ordinances were before me, and his statutes had I not put away from me. 
\v 23 (18:24) I was also upright with him, and I guarded myself against my iniquity. 
\v 24 (18:25) Therefore did the Lord recompense me according to my righteousness, according to the purity of my hands before his eyes. 
\v 25 (18:26) With the kind thou wilt show thyself kind; with the upright man thou wilt show thyself upright; 
\v 26 (18:27) With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure; and with the perverse thou wilt wage a contest. 
\v 27 (18:28) For thou wilt indeed save the afflicted people; but haughty eyes wilt thou bring down. 
\v 28 (18:29) For thou wilt cause my light to shine: the Lord my God will enlighten my darkness. 
\v 29 (18:30) For [aided] by thee I run through a troop; and [helped] by my God I leap over a wall. 
\v 30 (18:31) As for God,—his way is perfect; the word of the Lord is tried: he is a shield to all those that trust in him. 
\v 31 (18:32) For who is God save the Lord? or who is a rock beside our God? 
\v 32 (18:33) He is the God that girdeth me with strength, and rendereth my way unobstructed. 
\v 33 (18:34) He maketh my feet like those of the hinds, and upon my high-places he causeth me to stand. 
\v 34 (18:35) He teacheth my hands for the war, so that a brazen bow is bent by my arms. 
\v 35 (18:36) And thou gavest me the shield of thy salvation, and thy right hand supported me: and thy meekness hath made me great. 
\v 36 (18:37) Thou enlargest my steps under me, so that my joints do not slip. 
\v 37 (18:38) I pursue my enemies, and overtake them; and I return not again till I have made an end of them. 
\v 38 (18:39) I crush them that they are not able to rise: they fall under my feet. 
\v 39 (18:40) For thou hast girded me with strength for the war: thou subduest my opponents under me. 
\v 40 (18:41) And my enemies thou causest to turn their back to me; and those that hate me,—that I may destroy them. 
\v 41 (18:42) They cry, but there is none to help; unto the Lord,—but he answereth them not. 
\v 42 (18:43) And I beat them small as the dust before the wind: like the dirt in the streets do I cast them out. 
\v 43 (18:44) Thou deliverest me from the contests of the people; thou appointest me to be the head of nations: a people that I know not shall serve me. 
\v 44 (18:45) As soon as their ear heareth they shall be obedient to me: the children of the stranger shall utter flattery unto me. 
\v 45 (18:46) The children of the stranger shall fade away, and come forth trembling out of their close places. 
\v 46 (18:47) The Lord liveth, and blessed be my Rock; and exalted be the God of my salvation; 
\v 47 (18:48) The God that granteth me vengeance, and subdueth nations under me; 
\v 48 (18:49) That delivereth me from my enemies: also above my opponents thou liftest me up; thou deliverest me from the man of violence. 
\v 49 (18:50) Therefore will I give thanks unto thee among the nations, O Lord, and unto thy name will I sing praises,— 
\v 50 (18:51) [To him] that maketh great the salvation of his king, and who sheweth kindness to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for ever.

\v 1 “To the chief musician, a psalm of David.” (19:2) The heavens relate the glory of God; and the expanse telleth of the works of his hands. 
\v 2 (19:3) Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night showeth knowledge. 
\v 3 (19:4) There is no speech, there are no words, their voice is not heard. 
\v 4 (19:5) [But] their melody extendeth through all the earth, and to the end of the world their words. For the sun hath he set a tabernacle among them; 
\v 5 (19:6) And he goeth out as a bridegroom from his chamber, he is glad like a strong man to run his course; 
\v 6 (19:7) From the end of the heavens is his going forth, and his circuit is unto their ends: and there is nothing hidden from his heat. 
\v 7 (19:8) The law of the Lord is perfect, quieting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple. 
\v 8 (19:9) The precepts of the Lord are upright, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the Lord is clear, enlightening the eyes. 
\v 9 (19:10) The fear of the Lord is pure, enduring for ever: the ordinances of the Lord are the truth, they are just altogether. 
\v 10 (19:11) They are those which are to be desired more than gold, and much fine gold; and they are sweeter than honey and the dropping of honeycomb. 
\v 11 (19:12) Moreover thy servant is admonished by them: in keeping them there is great reward. 
\v 12 (19:13) Who can guard against errors? from secret [faults] do thou cleanse me. 
\v 13 (19:14) Also from presumptuous [sins] withhold thy servant; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be blameless, and I shall be clear from any great transgression. 
\v 14 (19:15) May the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable before thee, O Lord, my Rock, and my Redeemer.

\v 1 “To the chief musician, a psalm of David.” (20:2) May the Lord answer thee on the day of distress; may the name of the God of Jacob protect thee; 
\v 2 (20:3) May he send thee help from the sanctuary, and support thee from Zion; 
\v 3 (20:4) May he remember all thy meat-offerings, and accept in favor thy burnt-sacrifice. Selah. 
\v 4 (20:5) May he grant thee according to thy own heart, and fulfill all thy resolves. 
\v 5 (20:6) We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God will we upraise our banners: may the Lord fulfill all thy petitions. 
\v 6 (20:7) Now I know that the Lord saveth his anointed: he will answer him from his holy heavens, with the saving strength of his right hand. 
\v 7 (20:8) Some [trust] in chariots, and some in horses; but we will invoke the name of the Lord our God. 
\v 8 (20:9) They are prostrate and fallen; but we are risen up and stand erect. 
\v 9 (20:10) O Lord, save [us]: may the king answer us on the day when we call [on him].

\p
\v 1 “To the chief musician, a psalm of David.” (21:2) O Lord, because of thy strength will the king rejoice; and through thy salvation how greatly will he be glad! 
\v 2 (21:3) The longing of his heart hast thou given him, and the request of his lips hast thou not withholden. Selah. 
\v 3 (21:4) For thou meetest him unasked with the blessings of happiness: thou settest on his head a crown of pure gold. 
\v 4 (21:5) Life hath he asked of thee, thou gavest it to him, length of days for ever and ever. 
\v 5 (21:6) Great is his honor through thy help: glory and majesty thou layest upon him. 
\v 6 (21:7) For thou appointest him to be a blessing for ever: thou makest him glad with joy from thy presence. 
\v 7 (21:8) For the king trusteth in the Lord; and through the kindness of the Most High shall he not be moved. 
\v 8 (21:9) Thy hand will reach all thy enemies: thy right hand will reach those that hate thee. 
\v 9 (21:10) Thou wilt render them as a fiery oven at the time of thy anger: the Lord in his wrath will destroy them, and a fire will devour them. 
\v 10 (21:11) Their fruit wilt thou cause to perish from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men. 
\v 11 (21:12) For they directed against thee evil: they devised a mischievous purpose, which they were not able to perform. 
\v 12 (21:13) For thou wilt make them turn their back; upon thy bow-strings thou wilt make ready [thy arrows] against their face. 
\v 13 (21:14) Exalt thyself, O Lord, in thy strength; [and] we will sing and praise thy power.

\v 1 “To the chief musician upon Ayeleth-hashachar, a psalm of David.” (22:2) My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far from saving me, and from the words of my loud complaint? 
\v 2 (22:3) O my God! I call in the day-time, but thou answerest not; and in the night I find no rest. 
\v 3 (22:4) But thou art holy, O thou that dwellest amidst the praises of Israel. 
\v 4 (22:5) In thee did our fathers trust: they trusted, and thou didst deliver them. 
\v 5 (22:6) Unto thee they cried, and were delivered: in thee they trusted, and were not put to shame. 
\v 6 (22:7) But I am a worm, and not a man, a reproach of men, and despised of people. 
\v 7 (22:8) All those who see me laugh me to scorn: they draw open their lips, they shake their head, [saying,] 
\v 8 (22:9) “Let him throw himself on the Lord, that he may deliver him: he will save him, for he delighteth in him.” 
\v 9 (22:10) Yea, thou art he that took me from the womb: thou hast been my trust when I hung on my mother's breasts. 
\v 10 (22:11) Upon thee was I cast from my birth: from my mother's womb art thou my God. 
\v 11 (22:12) Oh be not far from me [now]; for distress is near; for there is none to help. 
\v 12 (22:13) Many steers have encompassed me: the strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round. 
\v 13 (22:14) They have opened wide against me their mouth, [as] a ravenous and roaring lion. 
\v 14 (22:15) Like water am I poured out, and all my bones are disjointed: my heart is become like wax, it is melted in the midst of my entrails. 
\v 15 (22:16) Like a potsherd is my strength dried up; and my tongue cleaveth to my palate; and into the dust of death hast thou laid me down. 
\v 16 (22:17) For dogs have encompassed me; the assembly of the wicked have enclosed me: like lions [they threaten] my hands and my feet. 
\v 17 (22:18) I may number all my bones: [while] they stare and look upon me. 
\v 18 (22:19) They divide my clothes among themselves, and for my garment do they cast lots. 
\v 19 (22:20) But thou, O Lord, be not far from me: O [thou who art] my strength, hasten to my aid. 
\v 20 (22:21) Deliver from the sword my life, from the power of the dog my solitary soul. 
\v 21 (22:22) Save me from the lion's mouth; as thou hast answered me from the horns of the reem. 
\v 22 (22:23) I will relate thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee. 
\v 23 (22:24) Ye that fear the Lord, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and be in dread of him, all ye the seed of Israel. 
\v 24 (22:25) For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the poor; neither hath he hidden his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard. 
\v 25 (22:26) Of thee shall be my praise in a great assembly: my vows will I pay in the presence of those who fear him. 
\v 26 (22:27) The meek shall eat and be satisfied; they who seek him shall praise the Lord: may your heart live for ever. 
\v 27 (22:28) All the ends of the world shall remember and return unto the Lord: and all the families of the nations shall bow themselves down before thee. 
\v 28 (22:29) For the kingdom is the Lord's, and he governeth the nations. 
\v 29 (22:30) All they that eat the fat of the earth shall bow themselves down; before him shall bend the knee all that are going down into the dust; for none can keep alive his own soul. 
\v 30 (22:31) Distant ages shall serve him; there shall be related of the Lord unto future generations. 
\v 31 (22:32) They will come, and will tell his righteousness unto a people yet unborn, that he hath done this.

\v 1 “A psalm of David.” The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. 
\v 2 In pastures of tender grass he causeth me to lie down: beside still waters he leadeth me. 
\v 3 My soul he refresheth: he guideth me in the tracks of righteousness for the sake of his name. 
\v 4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will not fear evil; for thou art with me: thy rod and thy staff—they indeed comfort me. 
\v 5 Thou preparest before me a table in the presence of my assailants; thou anointest with oil my head: my cup overfloweth. 
\v 6 Surely, only goodness and kindness shall follow me all the days of my life: and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord to the utmost length of days. 
\c 24

\v 1 “Of David a psalm.” Unto the Lord belongeth the earth with what filleth it, the world and they that dwell therein; 
\v 2 For upon seas hath he founded it, and upon rivers hath he established it. 
\v 3 Who shall ascend into the mountain of the Lord? and who shall be able to stand in his holy place? 
\v 4 He that is of clean hands, and pure of heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto falsehood, and hath not sworn deceitfully: 
\v 5 He shall bear away blessing from the Lord, and [the reward of] righteousness from the God of his salvation. 
\v 6 This is the generation of those that adore him, that seek thy presence, [the sons of] Jacob. Selah. 
\v 7 Raise your heads, O ye gates; and be raised wide, ye everlasting doors: and let the King of glory enter! 
\v 8 Who is this King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle. 
\v 9 Raise your heads, O ye gates; and raise [them] up, ye everlasting doors: and let the King of glory enter! 
\v 10 Who is then this King of glory? The Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory. Selah.

\p
\v 1 “Of David.” Unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul. 
\v 2 O my God, in thee do I trust, let me not be ashamed, let not my enemies triumph over me. 
\v 3 Yea, none that wait on thee will be put to shame: let those be put to shame who deal treacherously without cause. 
\v 4 Show me, O Lord, thy ways; teach me thy paths. 
\v 5 Lead me in thy truth, and teach me; for thou art the God of my salvation: on thee do I wait all the day. 
\v 6 Remember thy mercies, O Lord, and thy kindnesses; for they are from everlasting. 
\v 7 The sins of my youth and my transgressions do not remember: according to thy kindness bear thou me in remembrance, for the sake of thy goodness, O Lord. 
\v 8 Good and upright is the Lord: therefore he pointeth out to sinners the right way. 
\v 9 He guideth the meek in justice, and he teacheth the meek his way. 
\v 10 All the paths of the Lord are kindness and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies. 
\v 11 For the sake of thy name, O Lord, pardon my iniquity: although it is great. 
\v 12 Who is that man that feareth the Lord? to him will he point out the way which he is to choose? 
\v 13 His soul shall abide in happiness: and his seed shall inherit the land. 
\v 14 The secret counsel of the Lord is for those that fear him, and his covenant—to make it known to them. 
\v 15 My eyes are ever [directed] toward the Lord; for he will draw out of the net my feet. 
\v 16 Turn unto me, and be gracious unto me; for I am solitary and afflicted. 
\v 17 The distresses of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of my afflictions. 
\v 18 Look on my misery and my trouble; and forgive all my sins. 
\v 19 Look at my enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with the hatred of violence. 
\v 20 Oh, guard my soul; and deliver me: let me not be put to shame; for I put my trust in thee. 
\v 21 Let integrity and uprightness guard me; for I wait on thee. 
\v 22 Redeem, O God, Israel out of all his distresses. 
\c 26

\v 1 “Of David.” Judge me, O Lord; for I have indeed walked in my integrity: and in the Lord have I trusted; I shall not slip. 
\v 2 Try me, O Lord, and prove me; purify my reins and my heart. 
\v 3 For thy kindness is before my eyes; and I have walked in thy truth. 
\v 4 I have not sat with men of falsehood, and with dissemblers will I not enter [in communion]. 
\v 5 I have hated the assemblage of evil-doers; and with the wicked will I not sit. 
\v 6 I will wash in innocency my hands, and I will compass thy altar, O Lord: 
\v 7 That I may publish with a loud voice [my] thanksgiving, and relate all thy wondrous deeds. 
\v 8 Lord, I love the site of thy house, and the place where thy glory dwelleth. 
\v 9 Take not away with sinners my soul, nor with men of blood my life; 
\v 10 In whose hands are wicked devices, and whose right hand is full of bribes. 
\v 11 But as for me, I will walk in my integrity: redeem me, and be gracious unto me. 
\v 12 My foot standeth on an even place: in assemblies will I bless the Lord. 
\c 27  
\p
\v 1 “Of David.” The Lord is my light and my salvation; of whom shall I be afraid? the Lord is the fortress of my life; of whom shall I have dread? 
\v 2 When evil-doers come near against me to eat up my flesh, my assailants and my enemies at me: then do they stumble and fall. 
\v 3 If an army should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: if war should arise against me, even then will I have trust. 
\v 4 One thing have I asked of the Lord, that I will seek for: that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the loveliness of the Lord, and to be every morning early in his temple. 
\v 5 For he will hide me in his pavilion on the day of evil; he will conceal me in the secret of his tabernacle; upon a rock will he place me high. 
\v 6 And now will my head be lifted up above my enemies all round about me; and I will sacrifice in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy: I will sing, and I will triumphantly play unto the Lord. 
\v 7 Hear, O Lord, my voice, [when] I call, and be gracious unto me, and answer me. 
\v 8 Of thee, said my heart, “Seek ye my presence”: thy presence, Lord, will I seek. 
\v 9 Hide [then] not thy face from me; reject not in anger thy servant, thou [who] hast been my help: cast me not off, nor forsake me, O God of my salvation. 
\v 10 For my father and my mother have forsaken me; but the Lord will take me up. 
\v 11 Point me out thy way, O Lord! and guide me on a level path, because of those that regard me enviously. 
\v 12 Give me not up to the [revengeful] desire of my assailants; for there are risen up against me false witnesses, and such as utter violence. 
\v 13 Unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of life— 
\v 14 Wait on the Lord; be strong, and let thy heart be of good courage; and only wait on the Lord. 
\c 28  
\p
\v 1 “Of David.” Unto thee, O Lord, will I call; O my rock, turn not unheeding from me: lest thou turn away silent from me, and I become like those that go down into the pit. 
\v 2 Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when I lift up my hands toward the most holy place of thy sanctuary. 
\v 3 Snatch me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of injustice, who speak peace with their neighbors, with mischief in their heart. 
\v 4 Give unto them according to their doing, and according to the evil of their deeds; according to the work of their hands do thou give unto them: bestow their [just] recompense on them. 
\v 5 Because they have no regard for the doings of the Lord, nor the works of his hands: may he pull them down, and not build them up. 
\v 6 Blessed be the Lord, because he hath heard the voice of my supplications. 
\v 7 The Lord is my strength and my shield; in him hath my heart trusted, and I am helped, and my heart exulteth; and with my song will I thank him. 
\v 8 The Lord is strength unto them, and he is the fortress of victory of his anointed. 
\v 9 Help thy people, and bless thy heritage: and feed them, and exalt them unto all eternity.

\v 1 “A psalm of David.” Ascribe unto the Lord, O ye sons of the mighty, ascribe unto the Lord glory and strength. 
\v 2 Ascribe unto the Lord the glory of his name; bow down to the Lord in the beauty of holiness. 
\v 3 The voice of the Lord is upon the waters; the God of glory thundereth, the Lord—upon mighty waters. 
\v 4 The voice of the Lord [resoundeth] with power; the voice of the Lord [resoundeth] with majesty. 
\v 5 The voice of the Lord breaketh in pieces the cedars; yea, the Lord shivereth the cedars of Lebanon; 
\v 6 And he maketh them skip like a calf; Lebanon and Siryon like young reems. 
\v 7 The voice of the Lord heweth out flames of fire. 
\v 8 The voice of the Lord shaketh the wilderness; the Lord shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh. 
\v 9 The voice of the Lord causeth the hinds to start, and maketh bare forests: and in his temple every thing speaketh [of his] glory. 
\v 10 The Lord sat [enthroned] at the flood: and the Lord will sit as King for ever.

\v 1 “A psalm, a song at the dedication of the temple, of David.” (30:2) I will extol thee, O Lord; for thou hast lifted me up, and hast not suffered my enemies to rejoice over me. 
\v 2 (30:3) O Lord my God, I cried loudly unto thee, and thou hast healed me. 
\v 3 (30:4) O Lord, thou hast brought up from the nether world my soul: thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit. 
\v 4 (30:5) Sing unto the Lord, O ye his pious ones, and give thanks to the memorial of his holiness. 
\v 5 (30:6) For his anger is momentary, [but] life is in his favor: in the evening [cometh] weeping to stay for a night, but in the morning, there is joyful song. 
\v 6 (30:7) And I had said indeed in my prosperity, I shall never be moved. 
\v 7 (30:8) Lord, by thy favor hadst thou caused my mountain to stand in strength: thou didst hide thy face, [and] I was terrified. 
\v 8 (30:9) Unto thee, O Lord, will I call; and unto the Lord will I make supplication. 
\v 9 (30:10) What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the grave? Shall the dust thank thee? shall it announce thy truth? 
\v 10 (30:11) Hear, O Lord, and be gracious unto me: Lord, be thou a helper unto me. 
\v 11 (30:12) Thou hast changed my mourning into dancing for me; thou hast loosened my sack-cloth, and girded me with joy. 
\v 12 (30:13) To the end that my glorious soul may sing praise to thee, and never be silent. O Lord my God, for ever will I give thanks unto thee.

\v 1 “To the chief musician, a psalm of David.” (31:2) In thee, O Lord, do I put my trust; Oh that I may never be put to shame: through thy righteousness do thou release me. 
\v 2 (31:3) Bend unto me thy ear; speedily deliver me: be thou unto me as a rock of protection, as a mountain strong-hold to save me. 
\v 3 (31:4) For my rock and my stronghold art thou; and for the sake of thy name lead me, and guide me. 
\v 4 (31:5) Draw me out of the net which they have laid secretly for me; for thou art my protection. 
\v 5 (31:6) Into thy hand do I commit my spirit: thou redeemest me, O Lord, the God of truth. 
\v 6 (31:7) I hate those that depend on lying vanities; but I trust indeed in the Lord. 
\v 7 (31:8) I will be glad and rejoice in thy kindness; because thou hast seen my misery; thou hast taken cognizance of the distresses of my soul; 
\v 8 (31:9) And thou hast not surrendered me into the hand of the enemy: thou hast caused my feet to stand on an ample space. 
\v 9 (31:10) Be gracious unto me, O Lord, for I am in distress; my eye is consumed through vexation—my soul [too] and my body. 
\v 10 (31:11) For my life is spent with sorrow, and my years with sighing, my strength faileth because of my iniquity, and my bones are consumed. 
\v 11 (31:12) Because of all my assailants am I become a reproach, and unto my neighbors greatly so, and a terror to my acquaintance, those that see me abroad flee away from me. 
\v 12 (31:13) I am forgotten as a dead man out of the heart: I am become like a perishable vessel. 
\v 13 (31:14) For I have heard the slandering of many; terror was on every side, while they took counsel together against me: to take away my life did they purpose. 
\v 14 (31:15) But I trusted well in thee, O Lord: I said, Thou art my God. 
\v 15 (31:16) In thy hand are my destinies: deliver me from the hand of my enemies, and from my persecutors. 
\v 16 (31:17) Let thy face shine upon thy servant: save me through thy kindness. 
\v 17 (31:18) O Lord, let me not be put to shame; for I have called on thee: let the wicked be put to shame, let them be silent, [passing] to the nether world. 
\v 18 (31:19) Let the lying lips be made dumb, which speak hard things against the righteous, with pride and contempt. 
\v 19 (31:20) Oh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast treasured up for those that fear thee; which thou hast wrought for those that trust in thee before the sons of men! 
\v 20 (31:21) Thou wilt conceal them in the secret of thy presence from the conspiracy of men: thou wilt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues. 
\v 21 (31:22) Blessed be the Lord: for he hath shown me his kindness wonderfully in a beleaguered city. 
\v 22 (31:23) And yet had I said in my despondency, I am cut off from before thy eyes: nevertheless thou didst hear the voice of my supplications when I cried loudly unto thee. 
\v 23 (31:24) Oh love the Lord, all ye his pious ones: the Lord preserveth the faithful, and recompenses the presumption of him that acteth proudly. 
\v 24 (31:25) Be strong, and let your heart be of good courage, all ye that hope in the Lord.

\v 1 “Of David: a Maskil.” Happy is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. 
\v 2 Happy is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile. 
\v 3 When I kept silence, my bones wasted away through my crying all the day. 
\v 4 For by day and night lay thy hand heavily upon me: my [life's] moisture hath been changed through the droughts of summer. Selah. 
\v 5 My sin do I ever acknowledge unto thee, and my iniquity have I not covered up. I said, I will make confession because of my transgressions unto the Lord: and thou truly forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah. 
\v 6 For this shall every pious one pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely [then] when great waters overflow, they shall never reach unto him. 
\v 7 Thou art my hiding-place; from distress wilt thou preserve me; with songs of deliverance wilt thou encompass me. Selah. 
\v 8 I will instruct thee and I will teach thee concerning the way which thou oughtest to go: I will counsel thee with my eye. 
\v 9 Be ye not like the horse, or like the mule, who hath no understanding; who must be held in with bit and bridle, his ornament, lest he come near unto thee. 
\v 10 Many are the pains of the wicked; but him that trusteth in the Lord will he encompass with kindness. 
\v 11 Rejoice in the Lord, and be glad, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.

\v 1 Be joyful, O ye righteous, in the Lord; [for] unto the righteous praise is comely. 
\v 2 Give thanks unto the Lord with the harp: with the ten-stringed psaltery do ye sing [praises] unto him. 
\v 3 Sing unto him a new song; play beautifully amidst a triumphant shout. 
\v 4 For the word of the Lord is upright; and all his works [are done] in truth. 
\v 5 He loveth righteousness and justice: the earth is full of the kindness of the Lord. 
\v 6 By the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and by the breath of his mouth all their host. 
\v 7 He gathereth together like heaps the waters of the sea: he layeth up in store-houses the depths [of the sea]. 
\v 8 Let all the earth fear the Lord: of him stand in awe all the inhabitants of the world. 
\v 9 For he spoke, and it came into being: he commanded, and it stood fast. 
\v 10 The Lord frustrateth the resolves of the nations: he bringeth to nought the thoughts of the people. 
\v 11 The counsel of the Lord will stand for ever, the thoughts of his heart from generation to generation. 
\v 12 Happy is the nation whose God is the Lord, the people whom he hath chosen for himself as a heritage. 
\v 13 The Lord looketh from heaven; he seeth all the sons of men. 
\v 14 From the place of his habitation he directeth his view upon all the inhabitants of the earth; 
\v 15 He fashioneth their hearts altogether; he hath regard to all their works. 
\v 16 The king is not saved by the multitude of an army: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength. 
\v 17 Vain is the horse for victory: nor shall he deliver any by the greatness of his strength. 
\v 18 Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon those that fear him, upon those that hope for his kindness. 
\v 19 To deliver from death their soul, and to keep them alive in famine. 
\v 20 Our soul waiteth for the Lord: our help and our shield is he. 
\v 21 For in him shall our heart rejoice: because in his holy name have we trusted. 
\v 22 Let thy kindness, O Lord, be upon us, even as we hope in thee.

\v 1 “By David, when he disguised his reason before Abimelech, who drove him away, and he departed.” (34:2) I will bless the Lord at all times: continually shall his praise be in my mouth. 
\v 2 (34:3) My soul shall make her boast in the Lord: the humble shall hear it, and be rejoiced. 
\v 3 (34:4) Oh magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together. 
\v 4 (34:5) I sought the Lord, and he answered me, and from all that I dreaded did he deliver me. 
\v 5 (34:6) They [who] looked unto him, were indeed enlightened, and their faces were not put to the blush. 
\v 6 (34:7) This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, and out of all his distresses did he save him. 
\v 7 (34:8) The angel of the Lord encampeth round about those who fear him, and delivereth them. 
\v 8 (34:9) Experience and see that the Lord is good: happy is the man that trusteth in him. 
\v 9 (34:10) Oh fear the Lord, ye his saints: for there is no want to those who fear him. 
\v 10 (34:11) The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger; but those who seek the Lord shall not want any good. 
\v 11 (34:12) Come, ye children, hearken unto me: the fear of the Lord will I teach you. 
\v 12 (34:13) Who is the man that desireth life, loveth [many] days, that he may see happiness? 
\v 13 (34:14) Guard thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking deceit. 
\v 14 (34:15) Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it. 
\v 15 (34:16) The eyes of the Lord are directed unto the righteous, and his ears unto their cry. 
\v 16 (34:17) [But] the anger of the Lord is against those that do evil, to cut off from the earth their remembrance. 
\v 17 (34:18) Those cry, and the Lord heareth, and from all their distresses he delivereth them. 
\v 18 (34:19) The Lord is nigh unto those that are broken-hearted: and he saveth those that are of a contrite spirit. 
\v 19 (34:20) Many are the afflictions of the righteous; but out of them all the Lord ever delivereth him. 
\v 20 (34:21) He watcheth all his bones: not one of them is broken. 
\v 21 (34:22) The evil will slay the wicked: and they who hate the righteous shall incur guiltiness. 
\v 22 (34:23) The Lord redeemeth the soul of his servants: and all that trust in him shall not incur guiltiness. 
\c 35

\v 1 “Of David.” Contend, O Lord, with those that contend with me: fight against those that fight against me. 
\v 2 Take hold of shield and buckler, and rise up for my help. 
\v 3 And draw out the spear, and step in against my pursuers; say unto my soul, I am thy salvation. 
\v 4 Let those be put to shame and be confounded that seek after my life: let those be turned backward and be made to blush, that devise unhappiness for me. 
\v 5 Let them be as chaff before the wind; and may the angel of the Lord cast them forth. 
\v 6 May their way be dark and slippery: and may the angel of the Lord pursue them. 
\v 7 For without cause have they hidden for me their net in a pit, without cause have they dug [pit-falls] against my life. 
\v 8 May then destruction come upon each of them at unawares; and may his net that he hath hidden catch himself: in [utter] destruction let him fall therein. 
\v 9 But my soul shall exult in the Lord: she shall be glad through his salvation. 
\v 10 All my bones will say, Lord, who is like unto thee, who deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor and the needy from him that robbeth him? 
\v 11 There rise up witnesses of violence; concerning what I know not they question me. 
\v 12 They recompense me with evil in place of good, [bringing] bereavement on my soul. 
\v 13 But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth: I afflicted with fasting my soul, and my prayer returned into my own bosom. 
\v 14 As though he had been to me a friend or a brother did I walk about: as one that mourneth for a mother did I sorrowfully bend down my head. 
\v 15 But in my downfall they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together; there gathered themselves together against me abject wretches, whom I knew not; they did tear me, and ceased not: 
\v 16 With hypocritical babbling mockers, they gnashed upon me with their teeth. 
\v 17 O Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their destructions, from the young lions my solitary spirit. 
\v 18 I will thank thee in the great assembly: among a mighty people will I praise thee. 
\v 19 Let not rejoice over me those that are my enemies wrongfully: [nor] let those who hate me without cause wink with the eye. 
\v 20 For they speak not peace; but against the quiet in the land they devise deceitful words. 
\v 21 Yea, they opened wide against me their mouth; they said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen it. 
\v 22 Thou hast seen it, O Lord! remain not silent: O Lord, be not far from me. 
\v 23 Arouse thyself, and awake to do me justice, my God and my Lord, unto my cause. 
\v 24 Judge me according to thy righteousness, O Lord my God; and let them not rejoice over me. 
\v 25 Let them not say in their heart, Aha, [this is the wish of] our soul: let them not say, We have swallowed him up. 
\v 26 Let those be made ashamed and put to the blush together that rejoice at my mishap; let them be clothed with shame and confusion that magnify themselves above me. 
\v 27 Let those shout, and rejoice, that desire my righteousness: yea, let them say continually, Great is the Lord, who desireth the welfare of his servant. 
\v 28 And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness, all the day of thy praise.

\v 1 “To the chief musician, by the servant of the Lord, by David.” (36:2) Saith vice itself to the wicked—so I feel it within my heart— that he should have no dread of God before his eyes. 
\v 2 (36:3) For he flattereth himself in his own eyes [too much] to find out his iniquity to hate it. 
\v 3 (36:4) The words of his mouth are wickedness and deceit: he hath left off to be wise, to do good. 
\v 4 (36:5) He deviseth wickedness upon his couch; he placeth himself on a way that is not good; evil he despiseth not. 
\v 5 (36:6) O Lord, into the heavens reacheth thy kindness, thy faithfulness even into the skies. 
\v 6 (36:7) Thy righteousness is like the mountains of God; thy acts of justice like the great deep: man and beast dost thou ever help, O Lord. 
\v 7 (36:8) How precious is thy kindness, O God! And the children of men that seek shelter under the shadow of thy wings,— 
\v 8 (36:9) These will be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and of the stream of thy delights wilt thou give them to drink. 
\v 9 (36:10) For with thee is the source of life: in thy light shall we see light. 
\v 10 (36:11) Draw down continuously thy kindness unto those that acknowledge thee; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart. 
\v 11 (36:12) Let not come against me the foot of pride, and let not the hand of the wicked chase me off. 
\v 12 (36:13) There are fallen the workers of wickedness: they are thrust down, and shall not be able to rise. 
\c 37  
\p
\v 1 “Of David.” Do not fret thyself because of the evil-doers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity. 
\v 2 For like the grass they shall soon be mowed down, and like the green herb shall they wither. 
\v 3 Trust in the Lord, and do good; dwell in the land, and feed [thyself] with truthfulness. 
\v 4 And delight thyself in the Lord, and he will give thee the wishes of thy heart. 
\v 5 Commit thy way unto the Lord, and trust in him: and he will accomplish it. 
\v 6 And he will bring forth as the light thy righteousness, and the justice of thy [cause] as the noonday. 
\v 7 Be silent before the Lord, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who practices wicked devices. 
\v 8 Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise to do evil. 
\v 9 For evil-doers shall be cut off; but those that wait upon the Lord, these—shall truly inherit the land. 
\v 10 For yet but for a little while, and the wicked shall be no more: yea, thou wilt look carefully at his place, and he shall not be there. 
\v 11 But the meek shall inherit the land, and shall delight themselves because of the abundance of peace. 
\v 12 The wicked purposeth evil against the just, and gnasheth against him with his teeth. 
\v 13 The Lord will laugh at him; for he seeth that his day is coming. 
\v 14 The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cause the poor and needy to fall, and to slaughter such as are of an upright course [of life]. 
\v 15 [But] their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken. 
\v 16 Better is the little that the righteous hath, than the great riches of many wicked. 
\v 17 For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the upholder of the righteous is the Lord. 
\v 18 The Lord regardeth the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall endure for ever. 
\v 19 They shall not be made ashamed in the time of unhappiness; and in the days of famine shall they be satisfied. 
\v 20 But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the Lord shall be as the beauty of the meadow: they pass away; in smoke they pass away. 
\v 21 The wicked borroweth, and repayeth not; but the righteous is beneficent, and giveth. 
\v 22 For those blessed of him shall inherit the land; and those cursed of him shall be cut off. 
\v 23 By the Lord are the steps of the righteous man established; and he findeth pleasure in his course [of life]. 
\v 24 Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down; for the Lord upholdeth his hand. 
\v 25 I have been young, and I am also grown old: yet have I never seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed seeking for bread. 
\v 26 He is all the time beneficent, and lendeth: and his seed will be for a blessing. 
\v 27 Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore. 
\v 28 For the Lord loveth justice, and never forsaketh his pious servants: they are for ever preserved; but the seed of the wicked will be cut off. 
\v 29 The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell for ever therein. 
\v 30 The mouth of the righteous uttereth wisdom, and his tongue speaketh what is just. 
\v 31 The law of his God is in his heart: none of his steps shall slip. 
\v 32 The wicked looketh out for the righteous, and seeketh to slay him. 
\v 33 The Lord will not leave him in his hand, and will not condemn him when he is judged. 
\v 34 Wait on the Lord, and keep his way, and he will exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, shalt thou look on. 
\v 35 I have seen the wicked terrible in power, and striking root like a green tree in its native soil. 
\v 36 Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was no more: and I sought him, but he could not be found. 
\v 37 Observe the perfect man, and behold the upright; for there is a [happy] future for the man of peace. 
\v 38 But the transgressors are destroyed together: the future of the wicked is cut off. 
\v 39 And the salvation of the righteous is from the Lord: he is their strong-hold in the time of distress. 
\v 40 And the Lord helpeth them, and delivereth them; he will deliver them from the wicked, and save them; because they have put their trust in him.

\v 1 “A psalm of David, to bring to remembrance.” (38:2) O Lord, correct me not in thy wrath, nor chastise me in thy fury. 
\v 2 (38:3) For thy arrows have penetrated into me, and thy hand presseth down upon me. 
\v 3 (38:4) There is no soundness in my flesh because of thy indignation: there is no peace in my bones because of my sin. 
\v 4 (38:5) For my iniquities are passed over my head, as a heavy burden are they too heavy for me. 
\v 5 (38:6) Foul, corrupt are my bruises because of my folly. 
\v 6 (38:7) I am bent double; I am bowed down to the utmost; all the day long I go about full of grief. 
\v 7 (38:8) For my loins are filled with a burning disease, and there is no soundness in my flesh. 
\v 8 (38:9) I am made faint and crushed to the utmost; I cry aloud because of the groaning of my heart. 
\v 9 (38:10) Lord, before thee is all my longing; and my sighing is from thee not hidden. 
\v 10 (38:11) My heart is restless, my strength hath left me; and the light of my eyes—that also is no more with me. 
\v 11 (38:12) My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my plague; and my kinsmen stand afar off. 
\v 12 (38:13) They also that seek after my life lay snares; and they that wish for my mishap speak wicked falsehoods; and deceits do they devise all the day long. 
\v 13 (38:14) But I, as a deaf man, hear not; and I am as a dumb man that cannot open his mouth. 
\v 14 (38:15) Thus am I as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no words of defence. 
\v 15 (38:16) For in thee, O Lord, do I hope: thou wilt answer, O Lord my God. 
\v 16 (38:17) For I said, Perhaps they might rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they might magnify themselves over me. 
\v 17 (38:18) For I am prepared for [my] downfall, and my pain is continually before me. 
\v 18 (38:19) For I will tell of my iniquity; I will be grieved because of my sin. 
\v 19 (38:20) But my enemies are strong in life; and numerous are those that hate me wrongfully; 
\v 20 (38:21) They also that repay [me] evil in lieu of good; they hate me bitterly because I pursue what is good. 
\v 21 (38:22) Forsake me not, O Lord: O my God, be not far from me. 
\v 22 (38:23) Make haste to help me, O Lord, my salvation.

\v 1 “To the chief musician, to Jeduthun, a psalm of David.” (39:2) I said, I will guard my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will guard my mouth with a muzzle, while the wicked is before me. 
\v 2 (39:3) I was dumb in deep silence, I was quite still, even from [speaking] good; but my pain was greatly excited; 
\v 3 (39:4) My heart was hot within me, in my self-communing there burnt a fire: [then] spoke I with my tongue, 
\v 4 (39:5) Let me know, O Lord, my end, and the measure of my days, what it is: I wish to know when I shall cease to be. 
\v 5 (39:6) Behold, measured out with the span hast thou made my days; and my whole duration is nothing before thee: yea, as nothing but vanity doth every man stand here. Selah. 
\v 6 (39:7) As nothing but a shadowy image doth man walk about, yea, for vanity only do all make a noise: he heapeth up his gains, and knoweth not who shall gather them. 
\v 7 (39:8) And now, what shall I wait for, O Lord? my hope is in thee. 
\v 8 (39:9) From all my transgressions deliver thou me: render me not the object of reproach of the worthless. 
\v 9 (39:10) I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou hadst done it. 
\v 10 (39:11) Remove thou thy plague away from me: from the blows of thy hand am I consumed. 
\v 11 (39:12) When thou with corrections chastisest man for iniquity, thou causest his excellence to melt away as [if eaten by] the moth: yea, nothing but vanity is every man. Selah. 
\v 12 (39:13) Hear my prayer, O Lord, and give ear unto my cry; be not silent at my tears; for a stranger am I with thee, a sojourner, like all my fathers. 
\v 13 (39:14) Leave off from me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and am no more.

\v 1 “To the chief musician, a psalm of David.” (40:2) I had waited patiently for the Lord, when he inclined himself unto me, and heard my cry. 
\v 2 (40:3) And he brought me up out of the noiseful deep, out of the miry clay, and he set up my feet upon a rock, making firm my steps. 
\v 3 (40:4) And he placed in my mouth a new song, a praise unto our God: many will see it, and fear; and they will trust in the Lord. 
\v 4 (40:5) Happy is the man that maketh the Lord his trust, and turneth not unto the proud, nor such as stray aside unto lies. 
\v 5 (40:6) Many things hast thou done, O Lord my God; thy wonderful deeds and thy thoughts toward us—there is none to be compared unto thee—will I tell and speak of, [though] they are too numerous to be counted. 
\v 6 (40:7) Sacrifice and meat-offering thou desirest not—ears hast thou hollowed out unto me—burnt-offering and sin-offering thou demandest not. 
\v 7 (40:8) Then said I, Lo, I come: in the roll of the book it is written down for me; 
\v 8 (40:9) To fulfill thy will, O my God, do I desire; and thy law is within my heart. 
\v 9 (40:10) I announce [thy] righteousness in the great assembly: lo, I will not refrain my lips, O Lord, thou well knowest it. 
\v 10 (40:11) Thy righteousness have I never hidden within my heart; thy faithfulness and thy salvation have I spoken of openly: I have not concealed thy kindness and thy truth before the great assembly. 
\v 11 (40:12) Do thou, O Lord, not withhold thy mercies from me: let thy kindness and thy truth continually watch over me. 
\v 12 (40:13) For evils without number have compassed me about; my iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to see: they are more numerous than the hairs of my head; and my courage hath forsaken me. 
\v 13 (40:14) Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me; O Lord, hasten to my help. 
\v 14 (40:15) May those be made ashamed and put to the blush together that seek after my soul to take her away: let them be driven backward and be confounded, that wish for my mishap. 
\v 15 (40:16) May they be astonished in consequence of their shame that say unto me, Aha, aha! 
\v 16 (40:17) [But] may all those that seek thee be glad and rejoice in thee: may they say continually, The Lord be magnified,—those that love thy salvation. 
\v 17 (40:18) But though I be poor and needy, the Lord will think of me: my help and my deliverer art thou: O my God, delay not.

\v 1 “To the chief musician, a psalm of David.” (41:2) Happy is he that careth for the poor: on the day of evil will the Lord deliver him. 
\v 2 (41:3) The Lord will preserve him, and keep him alive; he shall be made happy on the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto the revengeful desire of his enemies. 
\v 3 (41:4) The Lord will sustain him upon the bed of painful disease: thou changest all his couch in his sickness. 
\v 4 (41:5) I said, Lord, be gracious unto me: heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee. 
\v 5 (41:6) My enemies speak evil of me, When will he die, and his name perish? 
\v 6 (41:7) And if he come to see [me], he speaketh falsely: his heart gathereth wickedness to itself; he goeth abroad [and] speaketh it. 
\v 7 (41:8) Altogether whisper against me all that hate me: against me do they devise my injury. 
\v 8 (41:9) “His godless deed [say they] is poured out over him: as he lieth there he will never more rise up again.” 
\v 9 (41:10) Yea, even the man that should have sought my welfare, in whom I trusted, who eateth my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me. 
\v 10 (41:11) But thou, O Lord, be gracious unto me, and raise me up, that I may requite it unto them. 
\v 11 (41:12) By this do I know that thou art pleased with me, that my enemy doth not triumph over me. 
\v 12 (41:13) But as for me, thou upholdest me in my integrity, and placest me before thy presence for ever. 
\v 13 (41:14) Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen. BEGIM

\v 1 BOOK SECOND: “To the chief musician, a Maskil, for the sons of Korach.” (42:2) As a hart panteth after brooks of water, so panteth my soul after thee, O God. 
\v 2 (42:3) My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I go [again] and be seen in the presence of God? 
\v 3 (42:4) My tears have been my food day and night; because men say unto me all the day, Where is thy God? 
\v 4 (42:5) These things will I remember, and pour out my soul in me: how I was wont to pass along amidst the multitude, journeying with them as a pilgrim to the house of God, with the voice of joyful song and thanksgiving, among the festive throng. 
\v 5 (42:6) Why art thou cast down, O my soul, and disquieted in me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet thank him, because of the salvation of his countenance. 
\v 6 (42:7) O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I remember thee from the land of the Jordan, and from the peaks of Chermon, from the low mount. 
\v 7 (42:8) Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterfalls: all thy waves and thy billows have passed over me. 
\v 8 (42:9) In the daytime the Lord will command his kindness, and in the night his song shall be with me, as a prayer unto the God of my life. 
\v 9 (42:10) I will say unto God, my rock, why hast thou forgotten me? why must I walk grieved, under the oppression of the enemy? 
\v 10 (42:11) It is as death in my bones, when my assailants reproach me; when they say unto me all the day, Where is thy God? 
\v 11 (42:12) Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within met? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet thank him, the salvation of my countenance, and my God. 
\c 43  
\p
\v 1 Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation: from the deceitful and unjust man do thou deliver me. 
\v 2 For thou art the God of my fortress: why hast thou abandoned me? why must I walk about grieved, under the oppression of the enemy? 
\v 3 Send thou thy light and thy truth, these shall guide me; they shall bring me unto thy holy mountain, and to thy dwellings: 
\v 4 That I may go unto the altar of God, unto God the joy of my gladness; and that I may thank thee upon the harp, O God, my God. 
\v 5 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet thank him, the salvation of my countenance, and my God. 
\c 44  
\p
\v 1 “To the chief musician, for the sons of Korach, a Maskil.” (44:2) O God, with our ears have we heard, our fathers have told us, deeds which thou hadst done in their days, in times of old. 
\v 2 (44:3) Thou, with thy hand, didst indeed drive out nations, and plant them; thou didst ill-treat people, and cause them to spread out. 
\v 3 (44:4) For not by their sword did they obtain possession of the land, and their own arm brought them no victory; but thy right hand, and thy arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst given them thy favor. 
\v 4 (44:5) Thou art my King, O God: ordain salvation for Jacob. 
\v 5 (44:6) Through thee will we butt down our assailants: through thy name will we tread under foot our opponents. 
\v 6 (44:7) For not in my bow will I trust, and my sword shall not help me. 
\v 7 (44:8) But thou helpest us against our assailants, and those that hate us thou puttest to shame. 
\v 8 (44:9) Of God we boast all the day, and to thy name will we give thanks for ever. Selah. 
\v 9 (44:10) But [now] thou hast cast off, and put us to the blush, and goest not forth with our armies. 
\v 10 (44:11) Thou causest us to turn back from before our assailant: and they who hate us take spoil for themselves. 
\v 11 (44:12) Thou givest us up like sheep for food, and among the nations hast thou dispersed us. 
\v 12 (44:13) Thou sellest thy people for no value, and acquirest no gain by their price. 
\v 13 (44:14) Thou renderest us a reproach to our neighbors, a scorn and a derision to those that are round about us. 
\v 14 (44:15) Thou renderest us a by-word among the nations, a shaking of the head among the people. 
\v 15 (44:16) All the day is my disgrace before me, and the shame of my face covereth me; 
\v 16 (44:17) Because of the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and him that seeketh vengeance. 
\v 17 (44:18) All this is come over us, yet have we not forgotten thee; nor have we dealt falsely by thy covenant; 
\v 18 (44:19) Our heart is not moved backward, nor hath our step turned aside from thy path: 
\v 19 (44:20) Even when thou didst crush us in the abode of monsters, and cover us with the shadow of death. 
\v 20 (44:21) If we had forgotten the name of our God, or spread forth our hands to a strange God: 
\v 21 (44:22) Would not God search out this? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart. 
\v 22 (44:23) But for thy sake are we slain all the day; we are counted as flocks [destined] for slaughter. 
\v 23 (44:24) Awake, wherefore wilt thou sleep, O Lord? arise, abandon us not for ever. 
\v 24 (44:25) Wherefore wilt thou hide thy face, wilt thou forget our misery, and our oppression? 
\v 25 (44:26) For our soul is bowed down to the dust; our body cleaveth unto the earth. 
\v 26 (44:27) Arise unto our help, and redeem us for the sake of thy kindness.

\v 1 “To the chief musician upon Shoshannim, by the sons of Korach, a Maskil, a song of love.” (45:2) My heart swelleth with a good speech; I say, “My works shall be for the king:” my tongue is the pen of a ready writer. 
\v 2 (45:3) Thou art more fair than the children of men; grace is poured out over thy lips: therefore hath God blessed thee for ever. 
\v 3 (45:4) Gird thy sword upon the thigh, O mighty one, [it is] thy glory and thy majesty; 
\v 4 (45:5) Yea, it is thy majesty: be prosperous, ride along for the cause of truth and meekness and righteousness; and fearful things shall thy right hand teach thee. 
\v 5 (45:6) Thy sharpened arrows—people will fall down beneath thee—[will enter] into the heart of the king's enemies. 
\v 6 (45:7) Thy throne, given of God, endureth for ever and ever: the sceptre of equity is the sceptre of thy kingdom. 
\v 7 (45:8) Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore hath God, thy God, anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy associates. 
\v 8 (45:9) Of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia are [fragrant] all thy garments: out of palaces of ivory have they made thee joyful with the sound of music. 
\v 9 (45:10) Kings' daughters are among those dear to thee: the queen standeth on thy right hand in fine gold of Ophir. 
\v 10 (45:11) Hearken, O daughter, and look, and incline thy ear, and forget thy own people, and thy father's house: 
\v 11 (45:12) Then will the king long for thy beauty; for he is thy Lord; and bow thyself to him. 
\v 12 (45:13) And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift: the rich among the people shall entreat thy favor. 
\v 13 (45:14) All gloriously attired awaiteth the king's daughter in the inner chamber: of wrought gold is her garment. 
\v 14 (45:15) In embroidered clothes will she be brought unto the king: virgins that follow her, her companions, are brought unto thee. 
\v 15 (45:16) They are led forth with rejoicings and gladness, they enter into the palace of the king. 
\v 16 (45:17) Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children: thou wilt appoint them as princes in all the land. 
\v 17 (45:18) I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.

\v 1 “To the chief musician: by the sons of Korach, upon 'Alamoth, a song.” (46:2) God is our protection and strength, a help in distresses, very readily found. 
\v 2 (46:3) Therefore will we not fear, even when the earth is transformed, and when mountains are moved into the heart of the seas; 
\v 3 (46:4) [When] the waters thereof roar and foam, when mountains quake before his majesty. Selah. 
\v 4 (46:5) [There] is a river, its rivulets cause to rejoice the city of God, the sanctuary of the dwellings of the Most High. 
\v 5 (46:6) God is in her midst; she shall not be moved: God will ever help her, at the dawning of [her] morning. 
\v 6 (46:7) Nations rage, kingdoms are moved: he letteth his voice be heard, the earth melteth away. 
\v 7 (46:8) The Lord of hosts is with us; a defense unto us is the God of Jacob. Selah. 
\v 8 (46:9) Come, look at the deeds of the Lord, who hath made desolations on the earth. 
\v 9 (46:10) He causeth wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in pieces; he burneth wagons in the fire. 
\v 10 (46:11) Leave off, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted on the earth. 
\v 11 (46:12) The Lord of hosts is with us; a defence unto us is the God of Jacob. Selah.

\v 1 “To the chief musician, a psalm for the sons of Korach.” (47:2) All ye people, clap your hands; shout unto God with the voice of triumph. 
\v 2 (47:3) For the Lord is most high, fear-inspiring; he is a great king over all the earth. 
\v 3 (47:4) He will subdue people under us, and nations under our feet. 
\v 4 (47:5) He will choose for us our inheritance, the excellency of Jacob which he loveth. Selah. 
\v 5 (47:6) God ascendeth amid a triumphal shout, the Lord, amid the sound of the cornet. 
\v 6 (47:7) Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King, sing praises. 
\v 7 (47:8) For God is King of all the earth: sing ye praises with understanding. 
\v 8 (47:9) God reigneth over the nations; God sitteth upon his holy throne. 
\v 9 (47:10) The nobles of the people are gathered together, [to be with] the people of the God of Abraham; for unto God belong the shields of the earth: he is greatly exalted.

\v 1 “A song and psalm by the sons of Korach.” (48:2) Great is the Lord, and highly praised in the city of our God, [in] his holy mountain. 
\v 2 (48:3) A beautiful district, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, the farthest north, the city of the great King. 
\v 3 (48:4) God is become known in her palaces as a defence. 
\v 4 (48:5) For, lo, the kings were assembled, they are passed away together. 
\v 5 (48:6) They indeed saw—[and] so they were astonished; they were terrified, they were confounded. 
\v 6 (48:7) Trembling seized on them there, pain, as on a woman in travail. 
\v 7 (48:8) With the east wind thou breakest the ships of Tharshish. 
\v 8 (48:9) As we have heard, so have we seen [it] in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever. Selah. 
\v 9 (48:10) We have reflected on thy kindness, O God, in the midst of thy temple. 
\v 10 (48:11) As thy name is, O God, so is thy praise over the ends of the earth: of righteousness is thy right hand full. 
\v 11 (48:12) Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad, because of thy judgments. 
\v 12 (48:13) Compass Zion about, and walk round about her; number her towers. 
\v 13 (48:14) Direct your mind to her outer wall, mark carefully her palaces: in order that ye may tell it to the latest generation. 
\v 14 (48:15) For this One is God, our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide even unto death.

\v 1 “To the chief musician, by the sons of Korach, a psalm.” (49:2) Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the perishable world: 
\v 2 (49:3) Both the sons of the low and the sons of the high, rich and needy, altogether. 
\v 3 (49:4) My mouth shall speak wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding. 
\v 4 (49:5) I will incline my ear to a parable: I will open with the harp my riddle. 
\v 5 (49:6) Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my oppressors encompasseth me?— 
\v 6 (49:7) Of those that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves of the multitude of their riches? 
\v 7 (49:8) No one can in any wise redeem his brother, nor can he give to God redemption money for himself; 
\v 8 (49:9) For the ransom of their soul is too costly, and it is omitted for ever. 
\v 9 (49:10) And should he still live for ever? not see the pit? 
\v 10 (49:11) For he must see that wise men die, that together the fool and the brutish person perish and leave to others their wealth. 
\v 11 (49:12) Their inward thought is, that their houses are to be for ever, their dwelling-places, from generation to generation; they call them by their own names in [various] countries. 
\v 12 (49:13) Nevertheless man in [his] splendor endureth not: he is like the beasts [that] perish. 
\v 13 (49:14) This is their way, their folly: yet their posterity will take pleasure in their sayings. Selah. 
\v 14 (49:15) Like flocks are they thrust into the nether world; death will feed them; but the upright shall have dominion over them in that morning, and their form wasteth away in the nether world, [taken away] from their own dwelling. 
\v 15 (49:16) But God will redeem my soul from the power of the nether world; for he will take me away. Selah. 
\v 16 (49:17) Be not thou afraid when a man becometh rich, when the glory of his house is increased; 
\v 17 (49:18) For when he dieth he can take nothing away; his glory will not descend after him. 
\v 18 (49:19) For though he bless his soul during his life, and men praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself: 
\v 19 (49:20) She shall go to the generation of his fathers, unto eternity will these never see light. 
\v 20 (49:21) Man, though in splendor, who understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish. °

\v 1 “A psalm of Assaph.” The God of gods, the Lord, speaketh, and calleth the earth, from the rising of the sun unto his setting. 
\v 2 Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God shineth forth. 
\v 3 Our God is coming, and will not keep silence: a fire devoureth before him, and round him there rageth a mighty storm. 
\v 4 He will call to the heavens above, and to the earth, to judge his people. 
\v 5 “Gather together unto me my pious servants, who make a covenant with me by sacrifice.” 
\v 6 And the heavens tell of his righteousness; for God is judge himself. Selah. 
\v 7 “Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against thee: God, thy God, am I. 
\v 8 Not because of thy sacrifices will I reprove thee; and thy burnt-offerings are continually before me. 
\v 9 I will not take a bullock out of thy house, nor he-goats out of thy folds. 
\v 10 For mine are all the beasts of the forest, the cattle upon a thousand mountains. 
\v 11 I know all the fowls of the mountains: whatever moveth on the fields is with me. 
\v 12 If I were hungry, I would not say it to thee; for mine is the world, and what filleth it. 
\v 13 Do I eat the flesh of fatted bulls, or drink the blood of he-goats? 
\v 14 Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay unto the Most High thy vows; 
\v 15 And call on me on the day of distress: I will deliver thee,— and so wilt thou glorify me.” 
\v 16 But unto the wicked God saith, “What hast thou to do to relate my statutes, and why bearest thou my covenant upon thy mouth? 
\v 17 And yet thou hatest instruction, and castest my words behind thee. 
\v 18 When thou seest a thief, then art thou pleased with him, and with adulterers hast thou thy portion. 
\v 19 Thou lettest loose thy mouth with evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit. 
\v 20 Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; against thy own mother's son thou utterest slander. 
\v 21 These things hast thou done, and I kept silence: thou didst ween that I am like thyself; [but] I will reprove thee, and set it in order before thy eyes.” 
\v 22 Do but reflect on this, ye that forget God, lest I tear [you] in pieces, with none to deliver. 
\v 23 Whoso offereth thanksgiving glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth his course aright, will I show the salvation of God.

\v 1 “To the chief musician, a psalm of David, (51:2) When Nathan the prophet came unto him, after he had gone in unto Bath-sheba'.” (51:3) Be gracious unto me, O God, according to thy kindness: according to the greatness of thy mercies blot out my transgressions. 
\v 2 (51:4) Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. 
\v 3 (51:5) For of my transgressions I have full knowledge; and my sin is before me continually. 
\v 4 (51:6) To thee, thee only, have I sinned, and what is evil in thy eyes have I done:—in order that thou mightest be righteous when thou speakest, be justified when thou judgest. 
\v 5 (51:7) Behold, in iniquity was I brought forth; and in sin did my mother conceive me. 
\v 6 (51:8) Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: therefore do thou cause me to know wisdom in the recesses [of the heart]. 
\v 7 (51:9) Cleanse me from sin with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. 
\v 8 (51:10) Cause me to hear gladness and joy; that the bones which thou hast crushed may rejoice. 
\v 9 (51:11) Hide thy face from my sins, and all my iniquities do thou blot out. 
\v 10 (51:12) Create unto me a clean heart, O God; and a firm spirit renew thou within me. 
\v 11 (51:13) Cast me not away from thy presence; and thy holy spirit do not take from me. 
\v 12 (51:14) Restore unto me the gladness of thy salvation; and with a liberal spirit do thou support me.— 
\v 13 (51:15) I will teach transgressors thy ways, and sinners shall return unto thee. 
\v 14 (51:16) Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation; [that] my tongue may sing aloud of thy righteousness. 
\v 15 (51:17) O Lord, open thou my lips, and my mouth shall declare thy praise. 
\v 16 (51:18) For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: in burnt-offering hast thou no delight. 
\v 17 (51:19) The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, wilt thou not despise. 
\v 18 (51:20) Do good in thy favor unto Zion; build thou the walls of Jerusalem. 
\v 19 (51:21) Then wilt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt-offering and entire offering: then shall bullocks be offered upon thy altar.

\v 1 “To the chief musician, a Maskil of David, (52:2) When Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, and said unto him, David is come to the house of Achimelech.” (52:3) What vauntest thou thyself of wickedness, O mighty man? the kindness of God endureth all the time. 
\v 2 (52:4) Thy tongue deviseth mischiefs, like a sharpened razor, thou worker of deceit. 
\v 3 (52:5) Thou lovest evil more than good; falsehood more than speaking righteousness. Selah. 
\v 4 (52:6) Thou lovest all words of destruction, the tongue of deceit. 
\v 5 (52:7) [Therefore] God will also destroy thee for ever: he will take thee away, and pluck thee out of his tent, and root thee out of the land of life. Selah.— 
\v 6 (52:8) And the righteous shall see it, and they will be afraid, and laugh concerning him: 
\v 7 (52:9) “Lo, this is the man that made not God his fortress; but trusted in the abundance of his riches, relied proudly on his mischievous wickedness.” 
\v 8 (52:10) But I am like a green olive-tree in the house of God: I trust in the kindness of God for ever and ever. 
\v 9 (52:11) I will thank thee for ever, because thou hast done it: and I will wait on thy name, for [it is] good, before thy pious ones.

\v 2 (53:3) God looketh down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there be one intelligent, one who seeketh for God. 
\v 3 (53:4) Every one [of them] hath departed [from righteousness]; altogether are they become corrupt: there is none that doth good, no, not one. 
\v 4 (53:5) Is there no knowledge in the workers of wickedness? who eat up my people as they eat bread: [while] they do not call on God. 
\v 5 (53:6) There were they terrified with terror where there was no terror; for God had scattered the bones of those that encamped against thee: thou didst put them to shame, because God had rejected them.

\v 2 (54:4) O God, hear my prayer; give ear to the words of my mouth. 
\v 3 (54:5) For strangers [to goodness] are risen up against me, and powerful oppressors seek after my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah. 
\v 4 (54:6) Behold, God is a helper unto me: the Lord is among those that uphold my soul. 
\v 5 (54:7) He will cause the evil to return upon those that regard me with envy: in thy truth cut them off. 
\v 6 (54:8) I will liberally sacrifice unto thee: I will give thanks unto thy name, O Lord; for it is good.

\v 1 “To the chief musician on Neginoth, a Maskil of David.” (55:2) Give ear, O God, to my prayer, and hide not thyself from my supplication. 
\v 2 (55:3) Listen unto me, and answer me: I mourn in my grief, and moan; 
\v 3 (55:4) Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked; for they cast wrong upon me, and in wrath they attack me. 
\v 4 (55:5) My heart is sorely pained within me, and the terrors of death are fallen upon me. 
\v 5 (55:6) Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and shuddering hath covered me. 
\v 6 (55:7) And I said, Oh that some one would give me wings like a dove! I would fly away and dwell [quietly]. 
\v 7 (55:8) Lo, I would flee far away, I would spend my night in the wilderness. Selah. 
\v 8 (55:9) I would prepare hastily a refuge for me from the sweeping wind [and] from storm. 
\v 9 (55:10) Destroy, O Lord, divide their tongue; for I have seen violence and strife in the city; 
\v 10 (55:11) Day and night do these encompass it upon her walls: and wrong and trouble are in her midst. 
\v 11 (55:12) Mischief is in her midst: guile and deceit depart not from her streets. 
\v 12 (55:13) For it is not an enemy that reproached me; then I could bear it: not he that hateth me hath magnified himself against me; then I would have hidden myself from him; 
\v 13 (55:14) But it is thou, a man my equal, my guide, and my acquaintance; 
\v 14 (55:15) So that we took sweet secret counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in tumultuous company. 
\v 15 (55:16) Let him dispense death over them; let them go down alive into the nether world; for evil is in their dwelling, in the midst of them. 
\v 16 (55:17) I, however, will call on God: and the Lord will save me. 
\v 17 (55:18) At evening and morning and noon will I make my complaint and moan: and he heareth my voice.— 
\v 18 (55:19) He delivereth my soul in peace from the battle against me; for in multitudes are they [contending] with me. 
\v 19 (55:20) God will hear, and humble them—yea, he that sitteth enthroned from the oldest time Selah—those who dread no changes, and fear not God. 
\v 20 (55:21) He stretcheth out his hands against those at peace with him: he violateth his covenant. 
\v 21 (55:22) The creamy words of his mouth are smooth, yet there is war [in] his heart; his words are softer than oil, yet are they drawn swords. 
\v 22 (55:23) Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he will sustain thee: he will never suffer the righteous to be moved. 
\v 23 (55:24) But thou, O God, thou wilt bring them down into the pit of destruction: let not the men of blood and deceit live out half their days; but I will indeed trust in thee.

\v 3 (56:4) The day [when] I am afraid, I will still trust in thee. 
\v 4 (56:5) In God will I praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not be afraid: what can flesh do unto me? 
\v 5 (56:6) All the day they wrest my words: against me are all their thoughts for evil. 
\v 6 (56:7) They come together in troops, they hide themselves, they are those that watch my heels, as though they hoped [to take] my soul.

\v 8 (56:9) My wanderings hast thou well numbered: put thou my tears into thy bottle; behold, they are numbered by thee. 
\v 9 (56:10) Then shall my enemies retire backward on the day when I call [on thee]: this I know—that God is for me. 
\v 10 (56:11) In God will I praise the word: in the Lord will I praise the word.

\v 6 (57:7) A net have they prepared for my steps; my soul hath been bent down; they have dug before me a pit; they are fallen into the midst thereof. Selah.

\v 2 (58:3) Even in [your] heart ye work injustice: on the earth do ye weigh out the violence of your hands. 
\v 3 (58:4) The wicked are estranged [from goodness] from the womb: those who speak lies go astray from their very birth. 
\v 4 (58:5) They have poison like the poison of a serpent: [they are] like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear; 
\v 5 (58:6) Which will not hearken to the voice of conjurers, yea, that of the wisest of all charmers. 
\v 6 (58:7) O God, break out their teeth in their mouth: the jaw-teeth of the young lions tear thou out, O Lord. 
\v 7 (58:8) Let them melt away as water [which] runneth off: when each one bendeth [his bow to shoot] his arrows, let them be as if cut in pieces.

\v 1 “To the chief musician upon Shushan'eduth, a Michtham of David, to teach, (60:2) When he fought with Aram-naharayim, and with Aram-zobah, and Joab returned, and smote of Edom in the Salt Valley twelve thousand [men].” (60:3) O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast made a breach in us, thou hast been displeased: restore now unto us [thy favor]. 
\v 2 (60:4) Thou hast caused the earth to quake; thou hast split it: heal her breaches; for she is moved. 
\v 3 (60:5) Thou hast caused thy people to see hard things: thou hast made us to drink the wine of confusion. 
\v 4 (60:6) Thou hast given to those that fear thee a banner, to elevate themselves, because of the truth. Selah. 
\v 5 (60:7) In order that thy beloved may be delivered: help with thy right hand, and answer me. 
\v 6 (60:8) God hath spoken in his holiness: I will exult, I will divide Shechem, and the valley of Succoth will I measure out. 
\v 7 (60:9) Mine is Gil'ad, and mine is Menasseh; Ephraim also is the strong-hold of my head; of Judah are my chiefs; 
\v 8 (60:10) Moab is my washpot; upon Edom will I cast my shoe: Philistia, triumph thou but over me. 
\v 9 (60:11) Who will bring me into the fortified city? who will lead me as far as Edom? 
\v 10 (60:12) Behold, it is thou, O God, who hast cast us off; and thou, O God, goest not forth with our armies. 
\v 11 (60:13) Give us help against the assailant; for vain is the help of man. 
\v 12 (60:14) Through God shall we do valiantly: and he it is that will tread down our assailants.

\v 1 “To the chief musician upon Neginah, by David.” (61:2) Hear, O God, my entreaty; listen to my prayer. 
\v 2 (61:3) From the end of the earth will I call unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is too high for me. 
\v 3 (61:4) For thou hast been a shelter unto me, a strong tower against the enemy. 
\v 4 (61:5) Let me sojourn in thy tent to all eternity; let me be sheltered under the covert of thy wings. Selah. 
\v 5 (61:6) For thou, O God, hast truly listened to my vows: thou hast given back the heritage of those that fear thy name. 
\v 6 (61:7) Oh, add days unto the king's days: may his years be as of many generations. 
\v 7 (61:8) May he abide for ever before God: ordain that kindness and truth may guard him. 
\v 8 (61:9) So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may pay my vows day by day.

\v 1 “To the chief musician, upon Jeduthun, a psalm of David.” (62:2) Only in God my soul trusted in silence: from him cometh my salvation. 
\v 2 (62:3) Only he is my rock and my salvation; [he is] my defense: I shall not be greatly moved. 
\v 3 (62:4) How long will ye devise mischief against a man? will ye all assault him murderously, as though he were a falling wall, a tottering fence? 
\v 4 (62:5) Yea, from his height do they take counsel to cast [him] down; they delight in lies: with their mouth do they bless, but inwardly do they curse. Selah. 
\v 5 (62:6) Yea, in God hope in silence, my soul; for from him is my expectation. 
\v 6 (62:7) Only he is my rock and my salvation; [he is] my defence: I shall not be moved. 
\v 7 (62:8) With God are my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength [and] my protection are in God. 
\v 8 (62:9) Trust in him at all times, O ye people; pour out before him your heart: God is a protection for us. Selah. 
\v 9 (62:10) Verily nought are the sons of common men, a lie the sons of the great; they must rise in the balance; they are altogether [lighter] than nought. 
\v 10 (62:11) Do not put your trust in defrauding, and be not rendered vain through robbery: if riches flourish, set not your heart [upon them]. 
\v 11 (62:12) Once hath God spoken; [yea,] twice [what] I have heard: that strength belongeth unto God. 
\v 12 (62:13) And unto thee, O Lord, belongeth kindness; for thou wilt recompense every man according to his works.

\v 1 “A psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah.” (63:2) O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry land, and it is faint without water. 
\v 2 (63:3) As I have beheld thee in the sanctuary, seeing thy strength and thy glory; 
\v 3 (63:4) Because thy kindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee: 
\v 4 (63:5) Thus will I bless thee while I live; in thy name will I lift up my hands. 
\v 5 (63:6) As with fat and marrow will my soul be satisfied; and with tuneful lips shall my mouth praise thee. 
\v 6 (63:7) When I remember thee upon my couch, I meditate on thee in the night-watches. 
\v 7 (63:8) Because thou hast been a help unto me; and in the shadow of thy wings will I sing rejoicingly. 
\v 8 (63:9) My soul cleaveth unto following thee: me thy right hand upholdeth. 
\v 9 (63:10) But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go down into the lowest deeps of the earth. 
\v 10 (63:11) They shall be delivered up to the power of the sword: they shall become a prey for jackals. 
\v 11 (63:12) But the king shall rejoice in God: every one that sweareth by him shall glorify himself; for the mouth of those that speak falsehood shall be stopped.

\v 1 “To the chief musician, a psalm of David.” (64:2) Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint: preserve my life from the dread of the enemy. 
\v 2 (64:3) Hide me from the secret counsel of evil-doers, from the tumultuous assault of the workers of wickedness; 
\v 3 (64:4) Who whet their tongue like a sword, who aim with their arrow, the bitter word: 
\v 4 (64:5) To shoot in secret at the innocent; suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not. 
\v 5 (64:6) They encourage themselves in an evil plan; they tell secretly of laying snares: they say, Who will see them? 
\v 6 (64:7) They search out iniquities; “We are ready with the carefully searched out device:” and the inward thought and heart of each is deeply [hidden]. 
\v 7 (64:8) But God shooteth at them suddenly [his] arrow;—[thence] are come their wounds. 
\v 8 (64:9) And their own tongues will stumble over themselves: all that look on them will shake their head. 
\v 9 (64:10) All men shall fear, and shall declare the deeds of God, and understand his works. 
\v 10 (64:11) The righteous shall rejoice in the Lord, and shall trust in him; and all the upright in heart shall glorify themselves.

\v 1 “To the chief musician, a psalm [and] song of David.” (65:2) For thee praise is waiting, O God, in Zion: and unto thee shall vows be paid. 
\v 2 (65:3) O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee all flesh shall come. 
\v 3 (65:4) The iniquitous things have become too mighty for me: our transgressions—these wilt thou wipe away. 
\v 4 (65:5) Happy is he whom thou choosest, and causest to approach, that he may dwell in thy courts: let us be satisfied with the happiness of thy house, the holiness of thy temple. 
\v 5 (65:6) With terrific deeds in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of our salvation, who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of the sea, that are far away; 
\v 6 (65:7) Who setteth firmly the mountains by his power, who is girded with might; 
\v 7 (65:8) Who assuageth the roaring of the seas, the roaring of their waves, and the tumult of nations. 
\v 8 (65:9) And they that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid of thy wondrous signs: the outgoings of the morning and evening thou causest to rejoice. 
\v 9 (65:10) Thou hast thought of the earth, and waterest her abundantly; thou greatly enrichest her; the brook of God is full of water: thou preparest their corn, when thou hast thus prepared her. 
\v 10 (65:11) Watering her furrows abundantly, smoothing down her ridges, thou softenest her with showers; thou blessest her growth. 
\v 11 (65:12) Thou hast crowned the year of thy goodness; and thy tracks drop fatness: 
\v 12 (65:13) The pastures of the wilderness are dropping [with plenty]: and the hills are girt with gladness. 
\v 13 (65:14) The meadows are clothed with flocks, and the valleys are enveloped with corn: men shout for joy, [yea,] they also sing.

\v 1 “To the chief musician, a song or psalm.” Shout joyfully unto God, all ye lands: 
\v 2 Sing forth the glory of his name; make glorious his praise. 
\v 3 Say unto God, How fear-inspiring is every one of thy works! through the greatness of thy strength will thy enemies yield feigned obedience unto thee. 
\v 4 All the lands shall bow themselves down unto thee, and shall sing praises unto thee; they shall sing praises to thy name. Selah. 
\v 5 Come and see the deeds of God: fear-inspiring is his doing toward the children of men. 
\v 6 He changed the sea into dry land: through the river they went on foot: there did we rejoice in him. 
\v 7 He ruleth by his might for ever; his eyes look upon the nations: the rebellious—these shall not be exalted. Selah. 
\v 8 Bless, O ye people, our God, and cause the voice of his praise to be heard: 
\v 9 Who hath appointed our soul to life, and hath not suffered our foot to slip. 
\v 10 For thou hast proved us, O God: thou hast refined us, as silver is refined. 
\v 11 Thou hast brought us into the net; thou hast placed fetters upon our loins. 
\v 12 Thou hast caused men to ride on our head: we entered into fire and into water; but thou broughtest us out to [the enjoyment] of overflowing plenty. a 
\v 13 I will enter thy house with burnt-offerings: I will pay unto thee my vows, 
\v 14 Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in distress. 
\v 15 Burnt-offerings of fatlings will I offer up unto thee, with the incense of rams; I will prepare steers with he-goats. Selah. 
\v 16 Come, hear, and I will relate, all ye that fear God, what he hath done for my soul. 
\v 17 Unto him I cried with my mouth, and a song of extolling was on my tongue. 
\v 18 If I had looked on wickedness with my heart, the Lord would not have heard; 
\v 19 But verily God hath heard; he hath listened to the voice of my prayer. 
\v 20 Blessed be God, who hath not removed my prayer [from him], nor his kindness from me.

\v 1 “To the chief musician on Neginoth, a psalm or song.” (67:2) May God be gracious unto us, and bless us; may he cause his face to shine upon us. Selah. 
\v 2 (67:3) That upon earth men may know thy way, among all nations thy salvation. 
\v 3 (67:4) The people will thank thee, O God; the people, all of them together, will thank thee. 
\v 4 (67:5) Nations will rejoice and sing for joy: when thou judgest the people righteously, and guidest the nations upon earth. Selah. 
\v 5 (67:6) The people will thank thee, O God; the people, all of them together, will thank thee. 
\v 6 (67:7) The earth yieldeth her products: [yea,] God, our own God, bless us. 
\v 7 (67:8) God will bless us: and all the ends of the earth shall fear him.

\v 1 “To the chief musician, by David, a Psalm or song.” (68:2) Oh that God would arise, that his enemies might be scattered, and those that hate him might flee before him. 
\v 2 (68:3) As smoke is driven off, so drive them away: as wax melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God. 
\v 3 (68:4) But the righteous shall rejoice; they shall exult before God: yea, they shall be exceedingly joyful. 
\v 4 (68:5) Sing unto God, sing praises to his name; extol him who rideth upon the heavens: the Everlasting is his name, and rejoice before him. 
\v 5 (68:6) A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God in his holy habitation. 
\v 6 (68:7) God places those who are solitary in the midst of their families: he bringeth out those who are bound unto happiness; but the rebellious dwell in a dry land. 
\v 7 (68:8) O God, when thou didst go forth before thy people, when thou didst tread along through the wilderness—Selah— 
\v 8 (68:9) The earth quaked, also the heavens dropped at the presence of God, yea, this Sinai, at the presence of God, the God of Israel. 
\v 9 (68:10) Rain of beneficence didst thou pour down, O God, whereby thou didst truly strengthen thy heritage, when it was weary. 
\v 10 (68:11) Thy assembly dwelt therein: thou didst prepare it with thy goodness for the afflicted [people]. O God, 
\v 11 (68:12) The Lord gave [happy] tidings; they are published by the female messengers, a numerous host. 
\v 12 (68:13) The kings of the armies flee away—flee away: yet she that tarried at home divideth the spoil. 
\v 13 (68:14) When ye lie still between the folds [of your cattle], [ye will be like] the wings of the dove covered with sliver, and her pinions shining with flaming gold. 
\v 14 (68:15) When the Almighty scattered kings in the midst of her, then even in darkness shone light [as pure] as snow. 
\v 15 (68:16) A mountain of God is the mount of Bashan; many peaks hath the mount of Bashan. 
\v 16 (68:17) Why watch ye enviously, ye many-peaked mountains, yonder mountain which God hath chosen for his residence? yea, the Lord will also dwell [there] for ever. 
\v 17 (68:18) The chariots of God are two myriads; thousands of angels [follow him]: the Lord is among them: so is Sinai holy [among mountains]. 
\v 18 (68:19) Thou didst ascend on high, lead away captives, receive gifts among men, yea, even the rebellious, to dwell among them. O Lord God. 
\v 19 (68:20) Blessed be the Lord; day by day he loadeth us [with benefits]; our God is our salvation. Selah. 
\v 20 (68:21) Our God is to us the God of salvation: and by the Eternal the Lord are the escapes from death. 
\v 21 (68:22) But God will crush the head of his enemies, the hairy skull of him who walketh in his guiltiness. 
\v 22 (68:23) The Lord hath said, From Bashan will I bring back, I will bring back from the depths of the sea: 
\v 23 (68:24) In order that thou mayest wade with thy feet in blood, feeding the tongue of thy dogs from the enemies' blood. 
\v 24 (68:25) Men see thy goings forth, O God! the goings forth of my God, my King, into the sanctuary. 
\v 25 (68:26) First come singers, then follow players on instruments, in the midst of maidens playing on timbrels. 
\v 26 (68:27) In assemblies bless ye God, [praise] the Lord, ye sprung from Israel's fountain. 
\v 27 (68:28) There Benjamin the youngest leadeth them on, the princes of Judah in purple robes, the princes of Zebulun, the princes of Naphtali. 
\v 28 (68:29) Thy God hath ordained the rule to thee: strengthen, O God, what thou hast wrought for us. 
\v 29 (68:30) Because of thy temple over Jerusalem shall kings bring presents unto thee. 
\v 30 (68:31) Rebuke the wild beasts hiding among the reeds, the troops of steers among the calves of nations, that hasten along with presents of silver. He scattereth nations that are eager for the fight. 
\v 31 (68:32) Nobles will come out of Egypt: Ethiopia will stretch forth eagerly her hands unto God. 
\v 32 (68:33) Kingdoms of the earth, sing unto God; sing praises unto the Lord: Selah; 
\v 33 (68:34) To him who rideth over the highest heavens, of ancient days: hear! he sendeth forth his voice, the voice of might. 
\v 34 (68:35) Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency is over Israel, and his strength is in the skies. 
\v 35 (68:36) Thou art tremendous, O God, from thy holy residences: O God of Israel, [thou art] he that givest strength and power unto [thy] people. Blessed be God.

\v 1 “To the chief musician upon Shoshannim, by David.” (69:2) Save me, O God; for the waters are come even to threaten my life. 
\v 2 (69:3) I am sunk in the mire of the deep, where there is no standing; I am come into the depths of the waters, and the flood overfloweth me. 
\v 3 (69:4) I am weary of my calling; my throat is hoarse; my eyes fail, while I hope for my God. 
\v 4 (69:5) More than the hairs of my head are those that hate me without a cause; numerous are those that would destroy me, that are my enemies wrongfully: what I have not robbed shall I now restore. 
\v 5 (69:6) O God, thou art well aware of my folly, and my guilty deeds are from thee not hidden. 
\v 6 (69:7) Let not those that wait on thee, O Lord Eternal of hosts, be made ashamed through me: let not those that seek thee be confounded through me, O God of Israel. 
\v 7 (69:8) Because for thy sake have I borne reproach, hath confusion covered my face. 
\v 8 (69:9) A stranger am I become unto my brothers, and an alien unto my mother's children. 
\v 9 (69:10) Because the zeal for thy house hath devoured me; and the reproaches of those that reproached thee are fallen upon me. 
\v 10 (69:11) When I wept at the fasting of my soul, it became a reproach to me. 
\v 11 (69:12) And when I made sackcloth my garment, I became a proverb to them. 
\v 12 (69:13) Those that sit in the gate talk against me; and [about me make] songs the drinkers of strong drink. 
\v 13 (69:14) But as for me, I direct my prayer unto thee, O Lord, in a time of favor; O God, in the multitude of thy kindness: answer me in the truth of thy salvation. 
\v 14 (69:15) Deliver me out of the mire, that I may not sink: let me be delivered from those that hate me, and out of the depths of the waters. 
\v 15 (69:16) Let not the flood of waters overflow me, and let not the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit close its mouth upon me. 
\v 16 (69:17) Answer me, O Lord; for thy kindness is good: according to the multitude of thy mercies turn thou unto me. 
\v 17 (69:18) And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in distress: make haste and answer me. 
\v 18 (69:19) Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: because of my enemies do thou ransom me. 
\v 19 (69:20) Thou well knowest my reproach, and my shame, and my confusion: before thee are all my assailants. 
\v 20 (69:21) Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am sick; and I waited for pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none. 
\v 21 (69:22) And they put into my food gall; and in my thirst they give me vinegar to drink. 
\v 22 (69:23) May [then] their table become a snare before them: and to those that are at peace, a trap. 
\v 23 (69:24) May their eyes become dark, that they cannot see; and make their loins continually to waver. 
\v 24 (69:25) Pour out over them thy indignation, and let the heat of thy anger overtake them. 
\v 25 (69:26) May their palace become desolate: in their tents let no one dwell. 
\v 26 (69:27) For whom thou hast smitten they persecute; and of the pain of those whom thou but wounded do they converse. 
\v 27 (69:28) Lay guilt upon their guilt; and let them not come into thy righteousness. 
\v 28 (69:29) Let them be blotted out of the book of the living; and with the righteous let them not be written down. 
\v 29 (69:30) But I am poor and suffering: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high. 
\v 30 (69:31) I will praise the name of God with song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving. 
\v 31 (69:32) And this will please the Lord better than an ox or bullock having horns and cloven hoofs. 
\v 32 (69:33) The meek will see this, and be rejoiced: ye that seek God, and your heart shall revive. 
\v 33 (69:34) For the Lord listeneth unto the needy, and his prisoners he despiseth not. 
\v 34 (69:35) Let heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein. 
\v 35 (69:36) For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may abide there, and have it in possession: 
\v 36 (69:37) And the seed of his servants shall inherit it; and they that love his name shall dwell therein.

\v 1 “To the chief musician, by David, to bring to remembrance.” (70:2) O God, [arise] to deliver me; O Lord, make haste to help me. 
\v 2 (70:3) Let those that seek after my life be made ashamed and put to the blush: let those that desire my unhappiness be turned backward and put to confusion. 
\v 3 (70:4) Let them be turned backward in consequence of their shame, that say, Aha, aha. 
\v 4 (70:5) Let all those that seek thee be glad and rejoice in thee: and let such as love thy salvation say continually, God is great. 
\v 5 (70:6) But I am poor and needy, O God: come hastily unto me; my help and my deliverer art thou: O Lord, do not delay. 
\c 71  
\p
\v 1 In thee, O Lord, do I put my trust; let me never be made ashamed. 
\v 2 In thy righteousness do thou deliver me and release me: incline thy ear unto me, and save me. 
\v 3 Be thou unto me a rocky habitation, whereunto I may continually resort, which thou hast ordained to save me; for my rock and my strong-hold art thou. 
\v 4 O my God, release me out of the hand of the wicked, out of the grasp of the unrighteous and violent man. 
\v 5 For thou art my hope, O Lord Eternal: thou art my trust from my youth. 
\v 6 By thee have I been supported from my birth: thou art he that took me out of my mother's womb: of thee is my praise continually. 
\v 7 As a wonderful token have I been unto many; but thou art my strong refuge. 
\v 8 My mouth shall be filled with thy praise, and with thy glory all the day. 
\v 9 Cast me not off in the time of old age: when my strength faileth, forsake me not. 
\v 10 For my enemies speak of me; and they that watch for my soul take counsel together, 
\v 11 Saying, “God hath forsaken him: pursue and seize him: for there is none to deliver.” 
\v 12 O God, be not far from me: O my God, hasten to my help. 
\v 13 Let those be made ashamed, let them perish, that are adversaries to my soul: let those be covered with reproach and dishonor that seek my unhappiness. 
\v 14 But I will continually hope, and will add yet more to all thy praise. 
\v 15 My mouth shall relate thy righteousness, all the day thy salvation; for I know not their numbers. 
\v 16 I will come to praise the mighty deeds of the Lord Eternal: I will make mention of thy righteousness, yea, thine only. 
\v 17 O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto I ever tell of thy wondrous deeds. 
\v 18 Therefore also even in old age, and when I am grayheaded, O God, forsake me not: until I have told of thy strength unto [this] generation, to every one that may come of thy might. 
\v 19 And thy righteousness, O God, reacheth even to the height, thou, who hast done great things: O God, who is like thee! 
\v 20 Thou, who hast shown me great distresses and misfortunes, wilt again revive me; and from the depths of the earth wilt thou bring me up again. 
\v 21 Thou wilt increase my greatness, and wilt turn round and comfort me. 
\v 22 Also I, I will thank thee with the psaltery, [for] thy truth, O my God: I will sing unto thee with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel. 
\v 23 My lips shall shout joyfully when I sing unto thee; and my soul [too], which thou hast redeemed. 
\v 24 Also my tongue shall speak all the day of thy righteousness; for ashamed, for put to the blush are those that seek my unhappiness.

\v 1 “By Solomon.” O God, give unto the king thy decisions, and thy righteousness unto the king's son. 
\v 2 He shall decide for thy people with righteousness, and for thy afflicted with justice. 
\v 3 The mountains shall bear peace for the people, and the hills [the same], through righteousness. 
\v 4 He shall judge the afflicted of the people, he shall give help to the children of the needy; but he shall crush the oppressor. 
\v 5 They shall fear thee as long as the sun shineth, and in the presence of the moon, throughout all generations. 
\v 6 He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass, as showers which are dropping on the earth. 
\v 7 In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace [shall be] till the moon shall be no more. 
\v 8 And he shall have dominion from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth. 
\v 9 Before him shall bend down those that dwell in the wilderness; and his enemies shall lick the dust. 
\v 10 The kings of Tharshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts. 
\v 11 Yea, there shall bow down before him all kings: all nations shall serve him. 
\v 12 For he will deliver the needy when he crieth; the afflicted also, who hath no helper. 
\v 13 He will spare the poor and needy; and the souls of the needy will he assist. 
\v 14 From wrong and violence will he deliver their soul; and precious shall their blood be in his eyes. 
\v 15 And he shall live; and he will give him of the gold of Sheba: and he will pray in his behalf continually; all the time will he bless him. 
\v 16 There shall be an abundance of corn in the land; upon the top of the mountains its fruit shall shake like [the trees of] Lebanon; and [men] shall blossom out of the city like herbs of the earth. 
\v 17 His name will endure for ever; in the presence of the sun his name shall flourish: and men shall bless themselves with him: all nations shall call him happy. 
\v 18 Blessed be the Lord the God, the God of Israel, who alone doth wondrous things. 
\v 19 And blessed he his glorious name for ever; and with his glory may the whole earth be filled: Amen, and Amen.

\v 1 BOOK THIRD: “A Psalm of Assaph.” Truly God is good to Israel, to such as are pure of heart. 
\v 2 But as for me, it lacked but little that my feet had been moved: almost nothing was needed that my steps had slipped. 
\v 3 For I was envious at the arrogant, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked. 
\v 4 For there are no deadly fetters for them, but their strength is firm. 
\v 5 They share not in the trouble of mortals, and with men are they not afflicted. 
\v 6 Therefore is pride their neck-chain: violence envelopeth them as a garment. 
\v 7 Their eyes start out from fatness: they have exceeded their heart's imaginings. 
\v 8 They scorn, and speak wickedly of oppression: loftily do they speak. 
\v 9 They set their mouth in the heavens, and their tongue walketh busily on the earth. 
\v 10 Therefore do his people turn away hither: and waters of a full cup are drained by them. 
\v 11 And they say, How should God know? and is there knowledge in the Most High? 
\v 12 Behold, these are the wicked; and yet prospering continually they increase in wealth. 
\v 13 Verily in vain have I thus cleansed my heart, and have washed in innocency my hands: 
\v 14 While I was afflicted all the day, and my chastisement [came] every morning. 
\v 15 But if I were to say, I will speak thus: behold, I would be treacherous against the generation of thy children. 
\v 16 And when I should think to know this, it would be trouble in my eyes; 
\v 17 Until I enter into the sanctuary of God; and understand what their future will be. 
\v 18 Surely thou placest them on slippery spots: thou lettest them fall down into destruction. 
\v 19 How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they perish, they come to their end with terrific events. 
\v 20 As a dream after awaking, O Lord, reject thou in wrath their image. 
\v 21 For it fermented in my heart, and in my reins I felt sharp thrusts; 
\v 22 But I was indeed foolish, and I knew it not: I was as a [thoughtless] beast with thee. 
\v 23 Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast seized hold of me by my right hand. 
\v 24 With thy counsel wilt thou guide me, and afterward take me on to glory. 
\v 25 Whom have I in heaven? and beside thee I desire nothing upon earth. 
\v 26 Though my flesh and my heart should fall; yet the rock of my heart, and my portion will be God for ever. 
\v 27 For, lo, those that are far from thee shall perish: thou destroyest every one that strayeth away from thee. 
\v 28 But as regardeth me, to draw near to God is good for me: I have put in the Lord Eternal my trust, that I may relate all thy works.

\v 1 “A Maskil of Assaph.” Why, O God, hast thou cast us off for ever? why will thy anger smoke against the flock of thy pasture? 
\v 2 Remember thy congregation, which thou didst acquire of old; which thou didst redeem as the tribe of thy inheritance: this mount Zion, whereon thou hast dwelt. 
\v 3 Lift up thy steps unto the perpetual heaps of ruins: the enemy hath ill-used every thing in the sanctuary. 
\v 4 Thy adversaries have roared in the midst of thy places of assembly: they have set up their signs for signs. 
\v 5 [The enemy] is known as one that lifteth up high axes against the thickets of a forest. 
\v 6 And now they hew in pieces the carved work thereof altogether with hatchets and hammers. 
\v 7 They have set on fire thy sanctuary; to the ground have they profaned the dwelling-place of thy name. 
\v 8 They have said in their heart, We will oppress them altogether: they have burnt up all the places of assembly of God in the land. 
\v 9 Our signs do we not see: there is no more any prophet: and there is no one among us that knoweth how long. 
\v 10 How long, O God, shall the adversary utter defiance? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever? 
\v 11 Why withdrawest thou thy hand, and thy right hand? [draw it] out of thy bosom—exterminate [them]; 
\v 12 Since [thou] God art my King from olden days, working salvation in the midst of the earth. 
\v 13 It was thou that didst divide by thy strength the sea: thou brokest in pieces the heads of the crocodiles on the waters. 
\v 14 Thou didst crush the heads of leviathan, and gavest them as food to the people inhabiting the wilderness. 
\v 15 Thou didst cleave fountain and stream: thou didst dry up ever-flowing rivers. 
\v 16 Thine is the day and thine is the night: it is thou who hast prepared the luminary and the sun. 
\v 17 It is thou who hast set up all the boundaries of the earth: summer and winter—thou thyself hast formed them. 
\v 18 Remember this, that the enemy hath defied the Lord, and that a worthless foolish people have blasphemed thy name. 
\v 19 Oh give not up unto the multitude of enemies the soul of thy turtle-dove: the congregation of thy afflicted do not thou forget for ever. 
\v 20 Look unto the covenant; for the dark places of the earth are full of habitations of violence. 
\v 21 Oh let not the oppressed return confounded: let the poor and needy praise thy name. 
\v 22 Arise, O God, plead thy own cause: remember thy defiance from the worthless fool all the day. 
\v 23 Forget not the voice of thy adversaries: the tumult of those that rise up against thee ascendeth continually.

\v 3 (75:4) The earth and all her inhabitants are melting away: I myself establish firmly her pillars.” Selah. 
\v 4 (75:5) I said unto the arrogant, Deal not arrogantly: and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn. 
\v 5 (75:6) Lift not up on high your horn, speak not with a stiffly erect neck. 
\v 6 (75:7) For neither from the rising [of the sun], nor from [his] setting, nor from the wilderness of mountains [cometh this]; 
\v 7 (75:8) But God is the judge: he lowereth one, and lifteth up another, 
\v 8 (75:9) For there is a cup in the hand of the Lord, and the wine foameth, it is full of mixture: and he poureth out of the same; but its lees they drain, they drink—all the wicked of the earth. 
\v 9 (75:10) But I will declare for ever, I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.

\v 3 (76:4) There broke he the shining arrows of the bow, shield, and sword, and battle. Selah. 
\v 4 (76:5) Thou art more brilliant, more excellent than the mountains [full] of prey. 
\v 5 (76:6) Bereft of reason are the stouthearted, they slumber their sleep: and none of the men of might have found [the use of] their hands. 
\v 6 (76:7) From thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, lie in deep sleep both chariot and horse. 
\v 7 (76:8) Thou—thou art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when once thy anger [is kindled]? 
\v 8 (76:9) From heaven hast thou caused [thy] sentence to be heard: the earth feared, and became still, 
\v 9 (76:10) When God rose to judgment, to save all the lowly of the earth. Selah. 
\v 10 (76:11) For the fury of man shall praise thee: the remainder of the fury wilt thou gird about thee. 
\v 11 (76:12) Make vows, and pay [them] unto the Lord your God, all ye that are round about him: let men bring presents unto him that exciteth fear.

\v 1 “To the chief musician on Jeduthun, by Assaph a psalm.” (77:2) [I lift up] my voice unto God, and I cry; [I lilt up] my voice unto God: do then give ear unto me. 
\v 2 (77:3) On the day of my distress I sought the Lord; in the night my hand was stretched out, and did not cease: my soul refused to be comforted. 
\v 3 (77:4) I think of God, and moan: I reflect, and my spirit is overwhelmed. Selah. 
\v 4 (77:5) Thou holdest my eyes awake: I am troubled and I cannot speak. 
\v 5 (77:6) I think over the days of old, the years of ancient times. 
\v 6 (77:7) I call to remembrance my song in the night; with my own heart I reflect: and my spirit maketh diligent search. 
\v 7 (77:8) Will the Lord cast me off for ever? and will he never more give his favor again? 
\v 8 (77:9) Is his kindness spent for ever? is his promise come to an end for all generations? 
\v 9 (77:10) Hath God forgotten to be gracious? or hath he shut up in anger his mercies? Selah. 
\v 10 (77:11) And I said, This shall be my entreaty, [for] the years of the right hand of the Most High. 
\v 11 (77:12) I will remember the deeds of the Lord; for I will remember out of ancient times thy wonders. 
\v 12 (77:13) I will meditate also of all thy work, and on thy deeds will I reflect. 
\v 13 (77:14) O God, in holiness is thy way: where is there a god so great as God? 
\v 14 (77:15) Thou art the God that dost wonders: thou hast made known among the people thy strength. 
\v 15 (77:16) Thou hast redeemed with [a mighty] arm thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah. 
\v 16 (77:17) The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they shook: also the depths trembled. 
\v 17 (77:18) The clouds poured out water; the skies sent forth thunder: also thy arrows sped along. 
\v 18 (77:19) The voice of thy thunder was in the whirlwind; lightnings gave light to the world; the earth trembled and quaked, 
\v 19 (77:20) Through the sea led thy way, and thy path was through mighty waters, and thy footsteps could not be known. 
\v 20 (77:21) Thou didst lead like a flock thy people by means of Moses and Aaron.

\v 1 “A Maskil of Assaph.” Give ear, O my people, to my instruction: incline thy ear to the words of my mouth. 
\v 2 I will open with a parable my mouth: I will utter riddles out of ancient times; 
\v 3 Which we have heard and know, and which our fathers have related unto us. 
\v 4 We will not conceal them from their children, relating to the latest generation the praises of the Lord, and his strength, and his wonderful deeds which he hath done. 
\v 5 Yea, he established a testimony in Jacob, and instituted a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children: 
\v 6 In order that the latest generation might know them, even the children that are to be born; that they may arise and relate them to their children; 
\v 7 That they may place in God their hope, and not forget the doings of God, but observe his commandments; 
\v 8 And that they may not be like their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that had not directed their heart firmly, and whose spirit was not faithful to God. 
\v 9 The children of Ephraim, like well-armed archers, that turn round on the day of battle, 
\v 10 Kept not the covenant of God, and in his law they refused to walk; 
\v 11 And they forgot his deeds, as also his wonders, which he had permitted them to see. 
\v 12 In the presence of their fathers did he do wonders, in the land of Egypt, in the fields of Zo'an. 
\v 13 He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters stand upright as a wall. 
\v 14 And he led them with the cloud by day, and all the night with a light of fire. 
\v 15 He split rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the mighty deep. 
\v 16 And he brought forth running streams out of the rock, and caused water to run down like rivers. 
\v 17 But they repeated to sin yet more against him, rebelling against the Most High in the desert. 
\v 18 And they tempted God in their heart, by asking food for their desire. 
\v 19 Yea, they spoke against God: they said, Will God be able to set in order a table in the wilderness? 
\v 20 Behold, he smote the rock, so that waters gushed out, and streams overflowed: shall he also be able to give bread? or can he provide flesh for his people? 
\v 21 Therefore, when the Lord heard this, he became wroth: and a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also ascended against Israel, 
\v 22 Because they had not believed in God, and had not trusted in his salvation. 
\v 23 Then he ordained the skies from above, and the doors of heaven he opened; 
\v 24 And he let rain down upon them manna to eat, and the corn of heaven gave he unto them. 
\v 25 Angels' bread did man eat: he sent them provision to satisfaction. 
\v 26 He caused an east wind to pass along the heavens; and he led forth by his strength the south wind. 
\v 27 And he let rain upon them flesh [as plentiful] as the dust, and winged birds like the sand of the sea; 
\v 28 And he let them fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations. 
\v 29 And they ate, and were greatly satisfied, and what they longed for he brought unto them. 
\v 30 They were not estranged from their longing, yet was their food in their mouth: 
\v 31 When the wrath of God ascended against them, and he slew some of the fattest of them, and the young men of Israel did he strike down. 
\v 32 With all this they sinned again, and believed not in his wonders. 
\v 33 Therefore he caused their days to come to an end in nought, and their years in dread. 
\v 34 When he slew them, then did they seek him, and they returned and inquired earnestly after God. 
\v 35 And they remembered that God was their rock, and the most high God their redeemer. 
\v 36 Nevertheless they prayed insincerely to him with their mouth, and with their tongue they lied unto him. 
\v 37 For their heart was not firm with him, and they were not faithful in his covenant. 
\v 38 But he, being merciful, forgave the iniquity, and destroyed [them] not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not awaken all his fury. 
\v 39 And he remembered that they are but flesh, a spirit that passeth away, and returneth not again. 
\v 40 How oft did they rebel against him in the wilderness, grieve him in the desert! 
\v 41 Yea, they once more tempted God, and set limits to the Holy One of Israel. 
\v 42 They remembered not his hand, the day when he ransomed them from the adversary; 
\v 43 When he displayed in Egypt his signs, and his wonderful tokens in the fields of Zo'an. 
\v 44 And he changed their rivers into blood; and their running streams, that they could not drink [of them]. 
\v 45 He sent out among them various wild beasts, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them. 
\v 46 And he gave unto the cricket their products, and their labor unto the locust. 
\v 47 He slew with hail their vines, and their sycamore-trees with ice-bolts. 
\v 48 And he surrendered to the hail their cattle, and their herds to the lightning's flashes. 
\v 49 He let loose against them the fierceness of his anger, wrath and indignation, and distress, a host of angels of misfortune. 
\v 50 He leveled a path for his anger; he withheld not from death their soul, and their life he surrendered to the pestilence; 
\v 51 And he smote all the first-born in Egypt; the first of their strength in the tents of Ham; 
\v 52 But he caused his own people to depart like flocks, and guided them like a drove in the wilderness. 
\v 53 And he led them in safety, so that they felt no dread; but the sea covered over their enemies. 
\v 54 And he brought them to his holy territory, even to this mount, which his right hand had acquired. 
\v 55 And he drove out from before them nations, and divided them by the measuring-line as an inheritance, and he caused to dwell in their tents the tribes of Israel. 
\v 56 Yet they tempted and rebelled against the most high God, and his testimonies they kept not; 
\v 57 But swerved aside, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers; they turned about like a deceitful bow. 
\v 58 And they provoked him to anger with their high-places, and with their graven images they moved him to jealousy. 
\v 59 God heard this, and he became wroth, and felt greatly disgusted with Israel; 
\v 60 And he cast off the dwelling at Shiloh, the tabernacle where he had dwelt among men; 
\v 61 And he gave up his strength unto captivity, and his glory into the adversary's hand. 
\v 62 And he surrendered his people unto the sword; and with his inheritance was he wroth. 
\v 63 His young men the fire devoured; and his virgins were not demanded in marriage. 
\v 64 His priests fell by the sword; and his widows did not weep. 
\v 65 Then awoke the Lord as one that sleepeth, like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine. 
\v 66 And he smote his enemies backward: a perpetual disgrace on them. 
\v 67 Yet was he disgusted with the tent of Joseph, and of the tribe of Ephraim he made not choice; 
\v 68 But he chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved. 
\v 69 And he built like high [mountains] his sanctuary, like the earth which he hath founded for ever. 
\v 70 And he made choice of David his servant, and took him from the sheep-folds: 
\v 71 From following the ewes with young he brought him, to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance. 
\v 72 And he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and by the skilfulness of his hands did he lead them.

\v 1 “A psalm of Assaph.” O God! nations have entered into thy heritage; they have profaned thy holy temple; they have rendered Jerusalem heaps of ruins. 
\v 2 They have given the dead bodies of thy servants as food unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy pious ones unto the beasts of the earth. 
\v 3 They have shed their blood like water all round about Jerusalem: and there is no one to bury them. 
\v 4 We are become a reproach to our neighbors, a scorn and derision to those that are round about us. 
\v 5 How long, Lord? wilt thou be indignant for ever? shall thy jealousy burn like fire? 
\v 6 Pour out thy fury over the nations that acknowledge thee not, and over the kingdoms that have not called on thy name. 
\v 7 For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling-place. 
\v 8 Oh remember not against us the iniquities of our fathers: make haste, let thy mercies come to our aid; for we are very miserable. 
\v 9 Help us, O God of our salvation, because of the glory of thy name; and deliver us, and atone for our sins, for the sake of thy name. 
\v 10 Wherefore shall the nations say, Where is their God? let there be made known among the nations before our eyes, the vengeance for the blood of thy servants which hath been shed. 
\v 11 Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee: according to the greatness of thy almighty power preserve thou those that are doomed to death; 
\v 12 And recompense unto our neighbors sevenfold into their bosom their defiance wherewith they have defied thee, O Lord. 
\v 13 But we thy people and the flock of thy pasture will give thanks unto thee for ever: from generation to generation will we relate thy praise.

\v 7 (80:8) O God of hosts, cause us to return, and let thy countenance shine, that we may be saved. 
\v 8 (80:9) A vine didst thou remove out of Egypt: thou drovest out nations, and plantedst it.

\v 10 (80:11) Mountains were covered with its shadow, and with its boughs the cedars of God. 
\v 11 (80:12) It sent out its tendrils as far as the sea, and unto the river its suckers. 
\v 12 (80:13) Wherefore hast thou now broken down its fences, so that all who pass by the way pluck the fruit from it? 
\v 13 (80:14) The boar out of the forest doth gnaw at it, and what moveth on the field feedeth on it. 
\v 14 (80:15) O God of hosts, return; I pray thee, look down from heaven, and behold, and think of this vine; 
\v 15 (80:16) And of the sprout which thy right hand hath planted, and of the branch that thou hast made strong for thyself. 
\v 16 (80:17) It is burnt with fire, it is hewn down; because of the rebuke of thy countenance do they perish. 
\v 17 (80:18) Let thy hand be over the man of thy right hand, over the son of man whom thou hast made strong for thyself.

\v 9 (81:10) There shall not be among thee a foreign God; nor shalt thou bow thyself down to any strange God. 
\v 10 (81:11) I am the Lord thy God, who have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt: open wide thy mouth, and I will fill it. 
\v 11 (81:12) But my people did not hearken to my voice; and Israel was not willing [to follow] me. 
\v 12 (81:13) So I let them go in the stubbornness of their own hearts: and they walked in their own counsels. 
\v 13 (81:14) Oh that my people would hearken unto me, that Israel would walk in my ways! 
\v 14 (81:15) In a little while would I subdue their enemies, and against their adversaries would I turn my hand. 
\v 15 (81:16) The haters of the Lord should offer flattery unto him; but their time should endure for ever.

\v 3 (83:4) Against thy people they take crafty secret device, and they consult against those whom thou protectest. 
\v 4 (83:5) They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; and the name of Israel shall be remembered no more. 
\v 5 (83:6) For they have consulted cordially together; against thee they make a covenant: 
\v 6 (83:7) The tents of Edom, and the Ishmaelites: Moab, and the Hagarenes; 
\v 7 (83:8) Gebal, and 'Ammon, and 'Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre; 
\v 8 (83:9) Also Asshur is joined with them; they have become an arm unto the children of Lot. Selah. 
\v 9 (83:10) Do unto them as [unto] Midian; as to Sissera, as to Jabin, at the brook Kishon: 
\v 10 (83:11) Who were annihilated at 'En-dor; they became as dung for the ground.

\v 12 (83:13) Who said, Let us conquer for ourselves the dwellings of God, 
\v 13 (83:14) O my God, render them like the thistle-down, like stubble before the wind. 
\v 14 (83:15) As the fire burneth up a forest, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire: 
\v 15 (83:16) So pursue them with thy storm, and with thy whirlwind do thou terrify them. 
\v 16 (83:17) Fill their faces with shame, that they may seek thy name, O Lord! 
\v 17 (83:18) Let them be made ashamed and terrified for ever and aye; yea, let them be put to the blush and perish:

\v 6 (84:7) Passing through the valley of weeping, they will change it into a spring: also the early rain covereth it with blessings.

\v 1 “To the chief musician, by the sons of Korach, a psalm.” (85:2) Thou hast been favorable, O Lord, unto thy land: thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob. 
\v 2 (85:3) Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people: thou hast covered over all their sin. Selah. 
\v 3 (85:4) Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast relinquished the fierceness of thy anger. 
\v 4 (85:5) Return to us, O God of our salvation, and cause thy ill-will toward us to cease. 
\v 5 (85:6) Wilt thou be wroth with us for ever? wilt thou extend thy anger from generation to generation? 
\v 6 (85:7) Wilt thou not [now] revive us again, that thy people may rejoice in thee? 
\v 7 (85:8) Show us thy kindness, O Lord, and grant us thy salvation. 
\v 8 (85:9) I will hear what God the Lord will speak; for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his pious ones: only let them not turn again to folly. 
\v 9 (85:10) Surely, nigh is his salvation unto those that fear him: that glory may dwell in our land. 
\v 10 (85:11) Kindness and truth are met together: righteousness and peace kiss each other. 
\v 11 (85:12) Truth will grow up out of the earth, and righteousness will look down from heaven. 
\v 12 (85:13) Yea, the Lord will also give the good, and our land will yield its products. 
\v 13 (85:14) Righteousness will walk firmly before him, and will make [level] the way by its steps.

\v 1 “A prayer of David.” Incline, O Lord, thy ear, answer me; for poor and needy am I. 
\v 2 Preserve my soul; for I am pious: help thy servant, O thou my God, that trusteth in thee. 
\v 3 Be gracious unto me, O Lord; for unto thee I call all the time. 
\v 4 Cause to rejoice the soul of thy servant; for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift my soul. 
\v 5 For thou, O Lord, art good and forgiving, and abundant in kindness unto all that call on thee. 
\v 6 Give ear, O Lord, unto my prayer, and attend to the voice of my supplications. 
\v 7 On the day of my distress will I call on thee; for thou wilt answer me. 
\v 8 There is none like unto thee among the Gods, O Lord; and there is nothing like thy works. 
\v 9 All the nations whom thou hast made shall come and bow themselves down before thee, O Lord; and they shall ascribe honor unto thy name. 
\v 10 For great art thou, and doing wondrous things: thou art God by thyself alone. 
\v 11 Teach me, O Lord, thy way; I will walk firmly in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name. 
\v 12 I will thank thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart, and I will honor thy name for evermore. 
\v 13 For thy kindness is great toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the grave of the lower world. 
\v 14 O God, the presumptuous are risen up against me, and the assembly of the powerful wicked have sought after my life, and have not set thee before them. 
\v 15 But thou, O Lord, art God, full of mercy, and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in kindness and truth. 
\v 16 Oh turn unto me, and be gracious unto me: give thy strength unto thy servant, and save the son of thy handmaid. 
\v 17 Display on me a sign for good, that those who hate me may see it, and be ashamed; because thou, Lord, hast helped me, and comforted me.

\v 1 “By the sons of Korach; a psalm or song.” It is founded by him on holy mountains. 
\v 2 The Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob. 
\v 3 Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah. 
\v 4 I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon as those that know me; behold, here is Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia: “This man was born there.” 
\v 5 But of Zion will it be said, “This and that man were born in her:” and the Most High himself doth establish her. 
\v 6 The Lord will number when he writeth down nations. “This man was born there.” Selah.

\v 1 “A song or psalm of the sons of Korach, to the chief musician upon Machalath-le'annoth, a Maskil of Heman the Ezrachite.” (88:2) O Lord the God of my salvation, by day do I cry, [and] at night I am before thee. 
\v 2 (88:3) Let my prayer come unto thy presence; incline thy ear unto my entreaty. 
\v 3 (88:4) For my soul is sated with troubles; and my life draweth nigh unto the nether world. 
\v 4 (88:5) I am counted with those that descend into the pit; I am become as a man without vigor: 
\v 5 (88:6) Free among the dead, like the slain that dwell in the grave, whom thou rememberest no more; and those that are cut off by thy hand. 
\v 6 (88:7) Thou hast laid me in the pit of the lower world, in darkness, in the depths. 
\v 7 (88:8) Upon me lieth heavily thy fury, and with all thy billows hast thou afflicted me. Selah. 
\v 8 (88:9) Thou hast removed my acquaintances far from me; thou hast rendered me an abomination unto them: I am imprisoned, and I cannot go forth. 
\v 9 (88:10) My eye languisheth by reason of affliction: I call on thee, O Lord, every day, I stretch out unto thee my hands. 
\v 10 (88:11) Wilt thou display wonders to the dead? shall the departed arise [and] thank thee? Selah. 
\v 11 (88:12) Shall thy kindness be related in the grave? thy faithfulness in the place of corruption? 
\v 12 (88:13) Shall thy wonders be acknowledged in the darkness? and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness? 
\v 13 (88:14) Yet I cry indeed aloud unto thee, O Lord; and in the morning shall my prayer come before thee. 
\v 14 (88:15) Why, O Lord, wilt thou cast off my soul? [why] wilt thou hide thy face from me? 
\v 15 (88:16) I am afflicted and perishing from my youth up: I bear thy terrors, I am distracted. 
\v 16 (88:17) Over me have the fires of thy wrath passed; thy terrors have destroyed me; 
\v 17 (88:18) They encompass me like water all the time; they have closed in round about me together. 
\v 18 (88:19) Thou hast removed far from me lover and friend, my acquaintances [are in] darkness.

\v 1 “A Maskil of Ethan the Ezrachite.” (89:2) The kindnesses of the Lord will I for ever sing: from generation to generation will I make known thy faithfulness with my mouth. 
\v 2 (89:3) For I have said, To eternity will kindness be built up: the heavens—yea, in these wilt thou establish thy faithfulness. 
\v 3 (89:4) “I have made a covenant with my elect, I have sworn unto David my servant, 
\v 4 (89:5) Unto eternity will I establish thy seed, and I will build up thy throne, from generation to generation.” Selah. 
\v 5 (89:6) And the heavens praise thy wonder, O Lord: also thy faithfulness in the assembly of holy ones. 
\v 6 (89:7) For who in the sky can be compared unto the Lord? who can be likened unto the Lord among the sons of the mighty? 
\v 7 (89:8) God is greatly terrific in the secret council of the holy ones and fear-inspiring over all that are about him. 
\v 8 (89:9) O Lord God of hosts, who is powerful, like thee, Eternal! and thy faithfulness is round about thee. 
\v 9 (89:10) Thou rulest over the pride of the sea: when its waves are lifted up, thou assuagest them. 
\v 10 (89:11) Thou didst crush Rahab as one that is slain: with thy strong arm didst thou scatter thy enemies. 
\v 11 (89:12) Thine are the heavens, also thine is the earth: as for the world and what filleth it, thou hast founded them. 
\v 12 (89:13) The north and the south—these hast thou created: Tabor and Chermon shall rejoice in thy name. 
\v 13 (89:14) Thine is the powerful arm, with might: strong is thy hand, and exalted is thy right hand. 
\v 14 (89:15) Righteousness and justice are the prop of thy throne: kindness and truth precede thy presence. 
\v 15 (89:16) Happy is the people that know the cornet's sound: O Lord, in the light of thy countenance will they ever walk firmly. 
\v 16 (89:17) In thy name will they be glad all the day, and in thy righteousness will they be exalted. 
\v 17 (89:18) For thou art the glory of their strength; and through thy favor will our horn be exalted. 
\v 18 (89:19) For of the Lord is our shield; and of the Holy One of Israel is our king. 
\v 19 (89:20) Then spokest thou in a vision to thy pious [servant], and saidst, “I have bestowed help to one that is mighty; I have exalted a youth out of the people; 
\v 20 (89:21) I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him; 
\v 21 (89:22) With whom my hand shall be firmly established; also my arm shall strengthen him; 
\v 22 (89:23) The enemy shall not exact from him like a lender: and the son of injustice shall not afflict him: 
\v 23 (89:24) And I will beat down before his face his assailants, and those that hate him will I plague. 
\v 24 (89:25) But my faithfulness and my kindness shall be with him: and through my name shall his horn be exalted. 
\v 25 (89:26) And I will place on the sea his hand, and on the rivers his right hand. 
\v 26 (89:27) He will call unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock of my salvation. 
\v 27 (89:28) Also I will appoint my first-born, the highest among the kings of the earth. 
\v 28 (89:29) For evermore will I keep for him my kindness, and my covenant shall stand faithfully with him. 
\v 29 (89:30) And I appoint for ever his seed, and his throne as the days of heaven. 
\v 30 (89:31) If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my ordinances; 
\v 31 (89:32) If they profane my statutes, and keep not my commandments: 
\v 32 (89:33) Then will I visit with the rod their transgressions, and with plagues their iniquity. 
\v 33 (89:34) Nevertheless my kindness will I not make utterly void from him, and I will not act falsely against my faithfulness. 
\v 34 (89:35) I will not profane my covenant, and what is gone out of my lips will I not alter. 
\v 35 (89:36) One thing have I sworn by my holiness, that I will not lie unto David. 
\v 36 (89:37) His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne shall be like the sun before me. 
\v 37 (89:38) Like the moon shall it be firmly established for ever, and as this faithful witness in the sky.” Selah. 
\v 38 (89:39) And yet thou hast east off and despised, thou hast become wroth with thy anointed. 
\v 39 (89:40) Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast profaned, down to the ground, his crown. 
\v 40 (89:41) Thou hast broken down all his fences: thou hast brought his strong-holds to terror. 
\v 41 (89:42) All that pass by the way plunder him: he is become a reproach to his neighbors. 
\v 42 (89:43) Thou hast raised up the right hand of his assailants: thou hast caused all his enemies to rejoice. 
\v 43 (89:44) Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not let him stand erect in the battle. 
\v 44 (89:45) Thou hast made his brilliancy cease; and his throne hast thou thrown down to the ground. 
\v 45 (89:46) Thou hast shortened the days of his youth: thou hast enshrouded him with shame. Selah. 
\v 46 (89:47) How long, Lord, wilt thou hide thyself, continually? how long shall thy fury burn like fire? 
\v 47 (89:48) Remember [what] I am, what my duration is [here], for what nothingness thou hast created all sons of men! 
\v 48 (89:49) What man is there that can live, and shall not see death? that can deliver his soul from the power of the nether word? Selah. 
\v 49 (89:50) Where are thy former kindnesses, O Lord, which thou hast sworn unto David by thy truth? 
\v 50 (89:51) Remember, Lord, the disgrace of thy servants; that I bear in my bosom the [burden] of all the many nations; 
\v 51 (89:52) That thy enemies have defied, O Lord; that they have defied the footsteps of thy anointed. 
\v 52 (89:53) Blessed be the Lord for evermore. Amen, and Amen.

\v 1 BOOK FOURTH: “A prayer of Moses the man of God.” Lord, a place of refuge hast thou been unto us in all generations. 
\v 2 Before yet the mountains were brought forth, or thou hadst ever produced the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God. 
\v 3 Thou turnest man to contrition, and sayest, Return ye children of men. 
\v 4 For a thousand years are in thy eyes but as the yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night. 
\v 5 Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: in the morning [they grow] like the grass which changeth. 
\v 6 In the morning it blossometh, and is changed: in the evening it is mowed off, and withereth. 
\v 7 For [thus] are we consumed by thy anger, and by thy fury are we terrified. 
\v 8 Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our concealed sins before the light of thy countenance. 
\v 9 For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we consume our years like a word that is spoken. 
\v 10 The days of our years in this life are seventy years; and if by uncommon vigor they be eighty, yet is their greatness trouble and mishap; for it soon hasteneth off, and we fly away. 
\v 11 Who knoweth the strength of thy anger, and thy wrath which is like the fear of thee? 
\v 12 Let us then know how to number our days, that we may obtain a heart endowed with wisdom. 
\v 13 Return, O Lord, how long yet? and bethink thee concerning thy servants. 
\v 14 O satisfy us in the morning with thy kindness, that we may be glad and rejoice throughout all our days. 
\v 15 Cause us to rejoice as many days as those wherein thou hast afflicted us, the years wherein we have seen unhappiness. 
\v 16 Let thy act be visible on thy servants, and thy majesty over their children. 
\v 17 And may the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us; and the work of our hands do thou firmly establish upon us: yea, the work of our hands—firmly establish thou it.

\v 1 He who sitteth under the secret protection of the Most High, shall rest under the shadow of the Almighty. 
\v 2 I will say of the Lord, who is my refuge and my stronghold, my God, in whom I ever trust, 
\v 3 That he will surely deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the pestilence of destruction. 
\v 4 With his pinions will he cover thee, and under his wings shalt thou find shelter: shield and buckler is his truth. 
\v 5 Thou shalt not be afraid of the terror of the night; nor of the arrow that flieth by day; 
\v 6 Nor of the pestilence that stalketh in darkness; nor of the deadly disease that wasteth at noonday. 
\v 7 There shall fall at thy side a thousand, and ten thousand at thy right hand; unto thee [however] shall it not come nigh. 
\v 8 Only with thy eyes shalt thou behold it, and see the recompense of the wicked. 
\v 9 Because thou hast [said], The Lord is my protection, the Most High hast thou made thy refuge: 
\v 10 No evil shall befall thee, nor shall any plague come nigh unto thy tent. 
\v 11 For his angels will he give charge concerning thee, to guard thee on all thy ways. 
\v 12 Upon [their] hands shall they bear thee, that thou mayest not dash against a stone thy foot. 
\v 13 Upon the fierce lion and asp shalt thou tread: thou shalt trample under foot the young lion and serpent. 
\v 14 Because he hath fixed his desire upon me, therefore will I release him: I will set him on high, because he knoweth my name. 
\v 15 He will call on me, and I will answer him: with him will I be in distress; I will deliver him, and grant him honor. 
\v 16 With length of days will I satisfy him, and I will let him see my salvation.

\v 1 “A psalm or song for the sabbath day.” (92:2) It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, and to sing praises unto thy name, O Most High: 
\v 2 (92:3) To tell in the morning of thy kindness, and of thy faithfulness in the nights. 
\v 3 (92:4) Upon a ten-stringed instrument, and upon the psaltery; and with the sweet sound of the harp. 
\v 4 (92:5) For thou hast caused me to rejoice, O Lord, through thy doing: because of the works of thy hands will I triumph. 
\v 5 (92:6) How great are thy works, O Lord! exceedingly profound are thy thoughts. 
\v 6 (92:7) A brutish man knoweth it not, and a fool cannot understand this. 
\v 7 (92:8) When the wicked spring up like herbs, and when all the workers of wickedness do flourish; it is that they may be destroyed evermore. 
\v 8 (92:9) But thou art exalted to eternity, O Lord! 
\v 9 (92:10) For, lo, thy enemies, O Lord, for, lo, thy enemies shall perish: all the workers of wickedness shall be scattered. 
\v 10 (92:11) But thou exaltest my horn like that of a reem: I am anointed with fresh oil. 
\v 11 (92:12) And my eye looketh on [the punishment of] those that regard me with envy: of the evildoers that rise up against me my ears shall bear it. 
\v 12 (92:13) The righteous shall spring up like the palm-tree: like a cedar in Lebanon shall he grow high. 
\v 13 (92:14) Planted in the house of the Lord, in the courts of our God shall they spring up. 
\v 14 (92:15) They shall still flourish in high old age; they shall be vigorous and covered with foliage; 
\v 15 (92:16) To declare that the Lord is upright: he is my rock, and there is no faultiness in him.

\v 1 The Lord reigneth, he is clothed with excellency; the Lord is clothed, he hath girded himself with strength: [therefore] also the world is firmly established, that it cannot be moved. 
\v 2 Firmly established is thy throne from the beginning: from everlasting art thou [God]. 
\v 3 The rivers have lifted up, O Lord, the rivers have lifted up their voice; the rivers lift up their waves. 
\v 4 [But] more than the noise of great waters, than the mighty billows of the sea, is the Lord excellent on high. 
\v 5 Thy testimonies are exceedingly steadfast: in thy house abideth holiness, O Lord! to the utmost length of days. 
\c 94  
\p
\v 1 O God, of vengeance, Lord! O God of vengeance, shine forth. 
\v 2 Lift up thyself, O judge of the Earth! bring a recompense upon the proud. 
\v 3 How long shall the wicked, O Lord—how long shall the wicked exult? 
\v 4 They sputter, they speak hard things: all the workers of wickedness boast themselves. 
\v 5 Thy people, O Lord! they crush, and thy heritage they afflict. 
\v 6 The widow and the stranger they slay, and the fatherless they murder. 
\v 7 And they say, The Lord will not see, and the God of Jacob will not take notice of it. 
\v 8 Understand, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when will ye become intelligent! 
\v 9 He that hath planted the ear, shall he not hear? or he that hath formed the eye, shall he not see? 
\v 10 He that admonisheth nations, shall he not correct? is it not he that teacheth man knowledge! 
\v 11 The Lord knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are nought. 
\v 12 Happy is the man whom thou admonisheth, O Lord, and teachest him out of thy law: 
\v 13 That thou mayest grant him repose from the days of evil, until the pot be dug for the wicked. 
\v 14 For the Lord will not cast off his people, and his inheritance will he not forsake. 
\v 15 For unto righteousness will justice return; and it shall be followed by all the upright in heart. 
\v 16 Who will rise up for me against evil-doers? or who will stand forward for me against the workers of wickedness? 
\v 17 Unless the Lord had been a help unto me, but a little would have been wanting that my soul had dwelt in the silence of death. 
\v 18 When I said, My foot hath slipped: thy kindness, O Lord, sustained me. 
\v 19 In the multitude of my [painful] thoughts within me, thy consolations delight my soul. 
\v 20 Can there be associated with thee the throne of destructive wickedness, which frameth mischief as a law? 
\v 21 They band themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and innocent blood do they condemn. 
\v 22 But the Lord is become my defence, and my God, the rock of my refuge. 
\v 23 And he will bring back upon them their own injustice, and in their own wickedness will he destroy them: [yea], he will destroy them—the Lord our God. 
\c 95

\v 1 O come, let us sing unto the Lord: let us shout joyfully to the rock of our salvation. 
\v 2 Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and shout joyfully unto him with psalms. 
\v 3 For a great God is the Lord, and a great King above all Gods; 
\v 4 In whose hand are the deep places of the earth; and whose are the heights of mountains; 
\v 5 Whose is the sea, and who hath made it; and whose hands have formed the dry land. 
\v 6 Oh come, let us prostrate ourselves and bow down: let us kneel before the Lord our Maker. 
\v 7 For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and the flock of his hand: yea, this day, if ye will hearken to his voice, 
\v 8 Harden not your heart, as at Meribah, as on the day of the temptation in the wilderness: 
\v 9 When your fathers tempted me, proved me, although they had seen my doing. 
\v 10 Forty years long did I feel loathing on that generation, and I said, It is a people of an erring heart; and they truly acknowledged not my ways: 
\v 11 So that I swore in my wrath, that they should not enter into my rest. 
\c 96

\v 1 Oh sing unto the Lord a new song: sing unto the Lord, all the lands. 
\v 2 Sing unto the Lord, bless his name: announce from day to day his salvation. 
\v 3 Relate among the nations his honor, among all the people his wonders. 
\v 4 For the Lord is great, and greatly praised: he is to be feared above all gods. 
\v 5 For all the gods of the nations are idols; but the Lord hath made the heavens. 
\v 6 Glory and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his sanctuary. 
\v 7 Ascribe unto the Lord, O ye families of the people, ascribe unto the Lord honor and strength. 
\v 8 Ascribe unto the Lord the honor [due unto] his name: bear hither a present, and come unto his courts. 
\v 9 Bow down unto the Lord in the beauty of holiness: tremble before him, all ye lands. 
\v 10 Say among the nations, “The Lord reigneth;” [therefore] also the world is ever firmly established that it shall hot be moved: he will judge the people in equity. 
\v 11 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad: let the sea roar, with all that filleth it. 
\v 12 Let the field exult, and all that is therein: then shall all the trees of the forest sing for joy, 
\v 13 Before the Lord; for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: he will judge the world with righteousness, and people in his truth. 
\c 97  
\p
\v 1 The Lord reigneth: let the earth be glad; let the multitude of isles rejoice. 
\v 2 Clouds and thick darkness are round about him: righteousness and justice are the support of his throne. 
\v 3 A fire goeth before him, and burneth up round about his adversaries. 
\v 4 His lightnings give light to the world: the earth seeth it, and trembleth. 
\v 5 The mountains melt away like wax at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the Lord of all the earth. 
\v 6 The heavens tell of his righteousness, and all the people his glory. 
\v 7 Made ashamed shall be all that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: unto him bow down all the gods. 
\v 8 Zion heareth it, and rejoiceth; and glad are the daughters of Judah, because of thy decrees, O Lord. 
\v 9 For thou, O Lord, art the most high above all the earth: thou art greatly exalted above all gods. 
\v 10 Ye that love the Lord, hate ye the evil: he preserveth the souls of his pious ones; out of the hand of the wicked he ever delivereth them. 
\v 11 Light is sown for the righteous, and joy for the upright in heart. 
\v 12 Rejoice, ye righteous, in the Lord, and give thanks to his holy memorial. 
\c 98

\v 1 “A psalm.” Oh sing unto the Lord a new song; for he hath done wonderful things: his right hand and his holy arm have gotten him the victory. 
\v 2 The Lord hath made known his salvation: before the eyes of the nations hath he revealed his righteousness. 
\v 3 He hath remembered his kindness and his truth toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God. 
\v 4 Shout joyfully unto the Lord, all the lands: break forth, and rejoice, and sing praises. 
\v 5 Sing praises unto the Lord with the harp,—with the harp, and the voice of psalmody. 
\v 6 With trumpets and the sound of cornet shout joyfully before the King, the Lord. 
\v 7 Let the sea roar, with all that filleth it; the world, with those that dwell therein. 
\v 8 Let the rivers clap their hands; let the mountains be joyful together, 
\v 9 Before the Lord; for he cometh to judge the earth: he will judge the world with righteousness, and people with equity.

\v 1 The Lord reigneth; people tremble: he sitteth enthroned over the cherubim; the earth is moved. 
\v 2 The Lord is great in Zion; and he is exalted above all the people. 
\v 3 They will give thanks to thy name, great, and terrible, [and] holy it is. 
\v 4 And to the power of the king who loveth justice and righteousness hast thou truly executed in Jacob. 
\v 5 Exalt ye the Lord our God, and bow yourselves down before his footstool: he is holy.— 
\v 6 Moses and Aaron were among his priests, and Samuel among those that call on his name; they called on the Lord, and he answered them. 
\v 7 In the pillar of cloud he used to speak unto them: they kept his testimonies, and the statutes which he had given unto them. 
\v 8 O Lord, our God, thou didst answer them: thou wast a forgiving God unto them, yet also an avenger for their wrong doings. 
\v 9 Exalt the Lord our God, and bow yourselves down before his holy mount; for holy is the Lord our God.

\v 4 Enter his gates with thanksgiving, his courts with praise: give thanks unto him, bless his name.

\v 3 I will not set before my eyes a godless thing; to commit a departure [from righteousness] do I hate; it shall not cleave to me. 
\v 4 A perverse heart shall depart from me: evil will I not know. 
\v 5 Whoso slandereth in secret his neighbor, him will I destroy: whoso hath proud eyes and a haughty heart, him will I not suffer. 
\v 6 My eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may abide with me: he that walketh in the way of the perfect, he it is that shall serve me. 
\v 7 He that practiseth deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that speaketh falsehoods shall not succeed before my eyes. 
\v 8 Every morning will I destroy all the wicked of the land, cutting off from the city of the Lord all the wrong-doers.

\v 1 “A prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, and poureth out before the Lord his complaint.” (102:2) O Lord, hear my prayer, and let my cry come unto thee. 
\v 2 (102:3) Hide not thy face from me on the day when I am distressed; incline unto me thy ear; on the day when I call, answer me speedily. 
\v 3 (102:4) For my days vanish in smoke, and my bones are burning like a hearth. 
\v 4 (102:5) Struck [by heat] like the herb and dried up is my heart; for I forget to eat my bread. 
\v 5 (102:6) Because of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my flesh. 
\v 6 (102:7) I am like the pelican of the wilderness: I am become like the owl amid ruins. 
\v 7 (102:8) I watch, and I am become like a [night-]bird sitting alone upon the housetop. 
\v 8 (102:9) All the day my enemies reproach me: they that mock me swear by me. 
\v 9 (102:10) For ashes do I eat like bread, and my drink I mingle with weeping; 
\v 10 (102:11) Because of thy indignation and thy wrath; for thou hadst lifted me up, and hast cast me down. 
\v 11 (102:12) My days are like a shadow that declineth; and like the herb I wither. 
\v 12 (102:13) But thou, O Lord, wilt sit enthroned for ever; and thy memorial is unto all generations. 
\v 13 (102:14) Thou wilt indeed arise; thou wilt have mercy upon Zion; for it is time to favor her, for the appointed time is coming. 
\v 14 (102:15) For thy servants hold dear her stones, and her very dust they cherish. 
\v 15 (102:16) Then shall nations fear the name of the Lord, and all the kings of the earth thy glory: 
\v 16 (102:17) When the Lord shalt have built up Zion, he appeareth in his glory; 
\v 17 (102:18) [When] he hath regarded the prayer of the forsaken, and doth not despise their prayer. 
\v 18 (102:19) This shall be written down for the latest generation; and the people which shall be created shall praise the Lord. 
\v 19 (102:20) For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; the Lord hath cast from heaven his view to the earth: 
\v 20 (102:21) To hear the sighing of the prisoner; to loosen those that are doomed to death: 
\v 21 (102:22) That men may proclaim in Zion the name of the Lord, and his praise in Jerusalem; 
\v 22 (102:23) When people are gathered together, and kingdoms, to serve the Lord.— 
\v 23 (102:24) He hath weakened on the way my strength; he hath shortened my days. 
\v 24 (102:25) I will say, O my God! take me not away in the midst of my days: throughout all generations are thy years. 
\v 25 (102:26) In olden times didst thou lay the foundations of the earth; and the heavens are the work of thy hands. 
\v 26 (102:27) These will indeed perish, but thou wilt ever exist: yea, all of them will wear out like a garment; as a vesture wilt thou change them, and they will be changed; 
\v 27 (102:28) But thou art ever the same, and thy years will have no end. 
\v 28 (102:29) The children of thy servants will dwell [securely], and their seed will be firmly established before thee.

\v 1 “Of David.” Bless, O my soul, the Lord, and all that is within me, his holy name. 
\v 2 Bless, O my soul, the Lord, and forget not all his benefits: 
\v 3 Who forgiveth all thy iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases; 
\v 4 Who redeemeth from the pit thy life; who crowneth thee with kindness and mercies; 
\v 5 Who satisfieth with happiness thy spirit, so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's [plumage]. 
\v 6 The Lord executeth righteousness, and justice for all that are oppressed. 
\v 7 He made known his ways unto Moses, unto the children of Israel his acts. 
\v 8 Merciful and gracious is the Lord, long-suffering and abundant in kindness. 
\v 9 Not for all eternity will he contend; nor will he for ever retain his anger. 
\v 10 Not in accordance with our sins hath he dealt with us; nor according to our iniquities hath he requited us. 
\v 11 For as high as heaven is above the earth, so mighty is his kindness toward those that fear him. 
\v 12 As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed from us our transgressions. 
\v 13 As a father hath mercy on his children, so hath the Lord mercy on those that fear him. 
\v 14 For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust. 
\v 15 As for man, like the grass are his days: as the blossom of the field, so doth he bloom. 
\v 16 When a wind but passeth over it, it is gone, and its place will recognize it no more. 
\v 17 But the kindness of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting over those that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's children, 
\v 18 To such as keep his covenant, and to those who remember his precepts to execute them. 
\v 19 The Lord hath established in the heavens his throne; and his kingdom ruleth over all. 
\v 20 Bless the Lord, ye his angels, mighty in strength, that execute his word, hearkening unto the voice of his word. 
\v 21 Bless ye the Lord, all his hosts, ye his ministers, that execute his will. 
\v 22 Bless the Lord, all his works, in all the places of his dominion; bless, O my soul, the Lord. 
\c 104  
\p
\v 1 Bless, O my soul, the Lord. O Lord my God, thou art very great; with glory and majesty art thou clothed. 
\v 2 [Thou art he] who wrappeth himself in light as with a garment; who stretcheth out the heavens like a curtain; 
\v 3 Who frameth of the waters the beams of his upper-chambers; who maketh the clouds his chariot; who walketh along upon the wings of the wind: 
\v 4 Who maketh the winds his messengers; the flaming fire his ministers; 
\v 5 Who hath founded the earth upon her bases, that she should not be moved to all eternity. 
\v 6 Thou hadst covered the deep as with a garment: above the mountains stood the waters. 
\v 7 At thy rebuke they fled, at the voice of thy thunder they hastened away. 
\v 8 They ascended mountains; they went down valleys, unto the place which thou hadst founded for them. 
\v 9 Bounds hast thou set which they cannot pass over, that they return not again to cover the earth. 
\v 10 [Thou art he] who sendeth springs into the valleys, between mountains they run along. 
\v 11 They give drink to all the beasts of the field: the wild asses quench [thereon] their thirst. 
\v 12 By them have the fowls of the heaven ever their habitation, from between the branches they send forth their voice. 
\v 13 Who watereth the mountains from his upper-chambers: from the fruit of thy works is the earth satisfied. 
\v 14 [Thou art he] who causeth grass to grow for the cattle, and herbs by the service of man, that he may bring forth bread out of the earth; 
\v 15 And wine that maketh joyful the heart of man, [and] oil to brighten his face, and bread which strengtheneth the heart of man. 
\v 16 Full of sap are the trees of the Lord, the cedars of Lebanon which he hath planted; 
\v 17 Where the birds make their nests: the stork—fir-trees are her house. 
\v 18 The high mountains are for the wild goats: the rocks are a shelter for the conies. 
\v 19 He hath made the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down. 
\v 20 Thou causest darkness, and it becometh night, wherein creep forth all the beasts of the forest. 
\v 21 The young lions roar after their prey, and ask from God their food. 
\v 22 The sun ariseth, they withdraw [to their lairs], and lie down in their dens. 
\v 23 Man goeth [then] forth unto his work, and to his labor until the evening. 
\v 24 How manifold are thy works, O Lord! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches. 
\v 25 Here is this great and wide-extended sea; therein are moving things without number, living creatures both small and great. 
\v 26 There the ships make their way: [there also] is the leviathan, whom thou hast made to sport therein. 
\v 27 All of these wait upon thee, to give them their food in its due season. 
\v 28 What thou givest them they gather: thou openest thy hand, they are satisfied with good. 
\v 29 Thou hidest thy face, they suddenly vanish: thou takest away their spirit, they perish, and to their dust they return. 
\v 30 Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created; and thou renewest the face of the earth. 
\v 31 The glory of the Lord will endure for ever; the Lord will rejoice in his works: 
\v 32 He who looketh down on the earth, and she trembleth; who toucheth the mountains, and they smoke. 
\v 33 I will sing unto the Lord while I live: I will sing praises to my God while I exist. 
\v 34 May my speech be agreeable to him: I will indeed rejoice in the Lord. 
\v 35 May the sinners cease from off the earth, and the wicked be no more. Bless, O my soul, the Lord. Hallelujah.

\v 1 O give thanks unto the Lord; call on his name: make known among the people his deeds. 
\v 2 Sing unto, him, sing praises unto him: speak of all his wonderful works. 
\v 3 Glorify yourselves in his holy name: let the heart of those rejoice that seek the Lord. 
\v 4 Inquire after the Lord and his strength: seek his presence evermore. 
\v 5 Remember his wonderful works which he hath done; his tokens, and the decrees of his mouth; 
\v 6 O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob, his elect. 
\v 7 He is the Lord our God: over all the earth are his decrees. 
\v 8 He remembereth his covenant for ever, the word which he hath commanded, to the thousandth generation. 
\v 9 Which he covenanted with Abraham; and his oath unto Isaac; 
\v 10 And which he established unto Jacob as a statute, unto Israel as an everlasting covenant: 
\v 11 Saying, “Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, as the portion of your inheritance.” 
\v 12 When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it; 
\v 13 And when they wandered from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people: 
\v 14 He suffered no man to oppress them; yea, he reproved kings for their sake; 
\v 15 [Saying,] “Touch not my anointed, and do my prophets no harm,”— 
\v 16 And he called for a famine over the land; every staff of bread he broke. 
\v 17 He sent a man before them; for a servant was Joseph sold; 
\v 18 They forced into fetters his feet; in iron was his body put: 
\v 19 Until the time that his word came to pass, [when] the saying of the Lord had purified him. 
\v 20 The king sent and unfettered him; the ruler of people, and let him go free. 
\v 21 He appointed him lord of his house, and ruler of all his possession: 
\v 22 That he might bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his ancients wisdom. 
\v 23 Then came Israel into Egypt, and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham. 
\v 24 And he increased his people greatly, and made them stronger than their adversaries. 
\v 25 He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilely with his servants. 
\v 26 He sent Moses his servant, Aaron also whom he had made choice of. 
\v 27 They displayed among them his effective signs, and wonders in the land of Ham. 
\v 28 He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word. 
\v 29 He changed their waters into blood, and slew their fish. 
\v 30 Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the very chambers of their kings. 
\v 31 He spoke, and there came various wild beasts, lice also within all their boundary. 
\v 32 He gave them as their rain hail, and flames of fire in their land. 
\v 33 And he smote their vines and their fig-trees, and broke the trees within their boundary. 
\v 34 He spoke, and the locusts came, and crickets, and that without number; 
\v 35 And they ate up all the herbs in their land, and ate up the fruit of their ground. 
\v 36 And he smote all the first-born in their land, the first of all their strength. 
\v 37 And he brought them forth with silver and gold: and there was not one that stumbled among his tribes. 
\v 38 Egypt rejoiced when they departed; for the dread of them was fallen upon them. 
\v 39 He spread out a cloud for a covering, and fire to give light in the night. 
\v 40 The people asked, and he brought quails, and with heavenly bread he satisfied them. 
\v 41 He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out: they ran in the dry places like a river. 
\v 42 For he remembered his holy word given to Abraham his servant. 
\v 43 And he brought forth his people with gladness, with joyful song his elect. 
\v 44 And he gave them the lands of nations; and the labor of people they obtained as an inheritance: 
\v 45 So that they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Hallelujah. 
\c 106  
\p
\v 1 Hallelujah. Oh give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good: for to eternity endureth his kindness. 
\v 2 Who can utter the mighty acts of the Lord? who can publish all his praise? 
\v 3 Happy are those that observe justice, that execute righteousness at all times. 
\v 4 Remember me, O Lord, when thou favorest thy people: oh visit me with thy salvation; 
\v 5 That I may look on the happiness of thy elect, that I may rejoice in the joy of thy nation, that I may glorify myself with thy inheritance. 
\v 6 We have sinned together with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly. 
\v 7 Our fathers did not reflect on thy wonders in Egypt: they remembered not the multitude of thy kindnesses; but rebelled at the sea, even at the Red Sea. 
\v 8 Nevertheless he saved them for the sake of his name, to make known his might. 
\v 9 He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up; and he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness. 
\v 10 And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. 
\v 11 And the waters covered their adversaries: not one of them was left. 
\v 12 Then believed they in his words, they sang his praise. 
\v 13 Speedily they forgot his works, they waited not for his counsel; 
\v 14 And they felt a lustful longing in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert. 
\v 15 And he gave them what they had asked; but sent dryness into their soul. 
\v 16 Moreover they envied Moses in the camp, and Aaron the holy one of the Lord. 
\v 17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered over the company of Abiram. 
\v 18 And a fire was kindled in their company: the flame burnt up the wicked. 
\v 19 They made a calf in Horeb, and bowed themselves down to a molten image. 
\v 20 And they exchanged their glory for the similitude of an ox that eateth herbs. 
\v 21 They forgot God their saviour, who had done great things in Egypt, 
\v 22 Wonders in the land of Ham, terrible things by the Red Sea. 
\v 23 He therefore spoke of destroying them: had not Moses his elect stood in the breach before him, to turn away his fury, that he might not destroy. 
\v 24 And they despised the pleasant land, they believed not in his word; 
\v 25 But they murmured in their tents, they hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord. 
\v 26 He therefore lifted up his hand against them, to cause them to fall in the wilderness; 
\v 27 And to let their seed fall among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands. 
\v 28 And they joined themselves unto Ba'al-pe'or, and ate the sacrifices of the dead. 
\v 29 And they provoked him to anger with their deeds: and there broke in among them the plague. 
\v 30 Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and the plague was stayed. 
\v 31 And it was accounted unto him for righteousness, unto all generations for evermore. 
\v 32 They angered him also at the waters of Meribah, and evil happened to Moses for their sake; 
\v 33 Because they had embittered his spirit, and so he spoke thoughtlessly with his lips. 
\v 34 They did not exterminate the nations, that the Lord had indicated to them; 
\v 35 But they mingled themselves among the nations, and learned their doings. 
\v 36 And they served their idols, and these became unto them a snare. 
\v 37 Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto the evil spirits; 
\v 38 And they shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood-guiltiness. 
\v 39 Thus were they made unclean through their own doings, and went astray with their own deeds. 
\v 40 therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled against his people, and be felt disgust for his own inheritance. 
\v 41 And he gave them up into the hand of the nations: and there ruled over them those that hated them. 
\v 42 And their enemies also oppressed them: and they were subdued under their hand. 
\v 43 Many times did he deliver them; but they rebelled with their counsel, and they were brought low through their iniquity. 
\v 44 Nevertheless he looked on when they were in distress, when he heard their entreaty. 
\v 45 And he remembered unto them his covenant, and he bethought himself according to the abundance of his kindnesses; 
\v 46 And be caused them to find mercy before all those that had carried them away captive. 
\v 47 Save us, O Lord our God, and gather us from among the nations, to give thanks unto thy holy name, to triumph in thy praise. 
\v 48 Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel from everlasting even to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen, Hallelujah.

\v 1 BOOK FIFTH: Oh give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good; for unto eternity endureth his kindness. 
\v 2 Thus let the Lord's redeemed say, even those whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the adversary; 
\v 3 And whom he hath gathered out of the [various] lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the sea. 
\v 4 They wandered about in the wilderness, in the desert path; they could not find an inhabited city: 
\v 5 Hungry and thirsty, their soul within them fainted. 
\v 6 Then they cried unto the Lord when they were in distress, [and] out of their afflictions he delivered them. 
\v 7 And he led them forth on the right way, that they might go to an inhabited city. 
\v 8 They [therefore] shall give thanks unto the Lord for his kindness, and [proclaim] his wonders to the children of men! 
\v 9 For he satisfied the longing soul, and the hungry soul he filled with good.— 
\v 10 Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, bound in misery and [fetters of] iron;— 
\v 11 Because they have rebelled against the words of God, and have contemned the counsel of the Most High; 
\v 12 And he humbled with trouble their heart; they stumbled, and there was none to help; 
\v 13 But when they cry unto the Lord when they are in distress, he saveth them out of their afflictions; 
\v 14 He bringeth them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and teareth their bands asunder. 
\v 15 They [therefore] shall give thanks unto the Lord for his kindness, and [proclaim] his wonders to the children of men! 
\v 16 For he hath broken the doors of copper, and the bolts of iron hath he hewn asunder.— 
\v 17 Fools, because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted. 
\v 18 All manner of food their soul abhorreth; and they draw near unto the gates of death; 
\v 19 But when they cry unto the Lord when they are in distress, he saveth them out of their afflictions. 
\v 20 He sendeth his word and healeth them, and delivereth them from their graves. 
\v 21 They [therefore] shall give thanks unto the Lord for his kindness, and [proclaim] his wonders to the children of men! 
\v 22 They shall also sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and relate his deeds with joyful song.— 
\v 23 They who go down to the sea in ships, who do business on great waters;— 
\v 24 These have seen the works of the Lord, and his wonders on the deep. 
\v 25 For he spoke, and he raised the stormy wind, which lifteth up its waves. 
\v 26 They would mount up to heaven, they would go down to the depths: their soul was melted because of their danger. 
\v 27 They would reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and all their wisdom was exhausted. 
\v 28 And they cried unto the Lord when they were in distress, and he brought them out of their afflictions. 
\v 29 He calmed the storm into a whisper, and stilled were the waves of the sea. 
\v 30 And they were rejoiced because they were silent: and then he guided them unto their desired haven. 
\v 31 They [therefore] shall give thanks unto the Lord for his kindness, and [proclaim] his wonders to the children of men! 
\v 32 And they must exalt him in the congregation of the people, and in the assembly of the elders must they praise him.— 
\v 33 He changeth rivers into a wilderness, and water-springs into parched ground; 
\v 34 A fruitful land into a salty waste, for the wickedness of those that dwell therein. 
\v 35 He changeth the wilderness into a pool of water, and desert land into water-springs. 
\v 36 And there he causeth to dwell the hungry, that they may found an inhabited city; 
\v 37 And they sow fields, and plant vineyards, that they may yield the fruits of the [annual] product. 
\v 38 He also blesseth them, and they multiply greatly, and he suffereth not their cattle to diminish. 
\v 39 They were also diminished and bowed low through oppression, misfortune, and sorrow: 
\v 40 He [then] poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in a pathless wilderness. 
\v 41 And he exalteth the needy from misery, and maketh [his] families like flocks. 
\v 42 The righteous shall see it, and rejoice; but all wickedness shall stop her mouth. 
\v 43 Whoever is wise, let him observe these things, and let [all] understand the kindness of the Lord.

\v 1 “To the chief musician, by David, a psalm.” O God of my praise, do not keep silence. 
\v 2 For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit are opened against me: they have spoken with me with the tongue of falsehood. 
\v 3 Also with words of hatred have they encompassed me, and they fight against me without a cause. 
\v 4 In recompense for my love are they my accusers, while I have nothing but prayer. 
\v 5 And they impose evil on me in recompense for good, and hatred in lieu of my love. 
\v 6 Appoint thou a wicked man over him: and let an accuser stand at his right hand. 
\v 7 When he is to be judged, let him go forth guilty, and let his prayer become sin. 
\v 8 Let his days be few, and let another take his office. 
\v 9 Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow. 
\v 10 Let his children be continually moving about, and beg, and let them seek [their bread] out of their ruined places. 
\v 11 Let the creditor lay snares after all that he hath, and let strangers plunder his labor. 
\v 12 Let him have none that extendeth kindness, and let there be none that is gracious to his fatherless children. 
\v 13 Let his posterity be cut off: in another generation let their name be blotted out. 
\v 14 Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered by the Lord, and let the sin of his mother not be blotted out. 
\v 15 Let them be before the Lord continually, that he may cut off from the earth their memory. 
\v 16 For the reason that he remembered not to show kindness; but persecuted the poor and needy man, and the grieved in heart to put him to death. 
\v 17 As he loved cursing, so let it come over him: and as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him. 
\v 18 And he clothed himself with cursing as with his garment, and it cometh like water within him, and like oil into his bones. 
\v 19 Let it be unto him as a garment in which he wrappeth himself, and for a girdle let him be continually girded with it. 
\v 20 Let this be the reward of my accusers from the Lord, and of those that speak evil against my soul. 
\v 21 But thou, O Eternal Lord, deal with me for the sake of thy name: because thy kindness is good, deliver thou me. 
\v 22 For poor and needy am I, and my heart is deeply wounded within me. 
\v 23 Like the shadow when it declineth do I hasten away: I am driven suddenly off like the locusts. 
\v 24 My knees stumble through fasting, and my flesh faileth of fatness. 
\v 25 And I am become a reproach unto them: when they see me, they shake their head. 
\v 26 Help me, O Lord my God: O save me according to thy kindness: 
\v 27 That they may know that this is thy hand: that thou, Lord, hast truly done it. 
\v 28 Let them then curse, but do thou bless: when they arise, let them be made ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice. 
\v 29 Let my accusers be clothed with confusion, and let them wrap themselves, as with a mantle, in their own shame. 
\v 30 I will thank the Lord greatly with my mouth, and in the midst of many will I praise him. 
\v 31 For he ever standeth at the right hand of the needy, to save him from those that judge his soul.

\v 3 Thy people will bring freewill-gifts on the day of thy power, in the ornaments of holiness: as out of the bosom of the morning-dawn so is thine the dew of thy youth. 
\v 4 The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent of it, Thou shalt be a priest for ever after the order of Malki-zedek. 
\v 5 The Lord at thy right hand crusheth kings on the day of his wrath. 
\v 6 He will judge among the nations—there shall be a fulness of corpses—he crusheth heads on a wide-spread land. 
\v 7 From the brook will he drink on the way: therefore will he lift up the head. 
\c 111  
\p
\v 1 Hallelujah. I will thank the Lord with all [my] heart, in the council of the upright, and in the congregation. 
\v 2 Great are the works of the Lord, they are sought for [by them] in all their desires. 
\v 3 Glorious and majestic is his doing, and his righteousness endureth for ever. 
\v 4 He hath made a memorial for his wonderful works: gracious and merciful is the Lord. 
\v 5 He hath given sustenance unto those that fear him: he will for ever be mindful of his covenant. 
\v 6 The power of his works hath he told unto his people, that he might give them the heritage of nations. 
\v 7 The works of his hands are truth and justice: faultless are all his precepts. 
\v 8 They are well supported for ever and eternally: they are framed in truth and uprightness. 
\v 9 Redemption hath he sent unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever: holy and to be feared is his name. 
\v 10 The beginning of wisdom is the fear of the Lord; a good understanding have all that fulfill [his commandments]: his praise endureth for ever. 
\c 112  
\p
\v 1 Hallelujah. Happy is the man that feareth the Lord, that greatly delighteth in his commandments. 
\v 2 His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the upright shall be blessed. 
\v 3 Plenty and riches shall be in his house, and his righteousness shall endure for ever. 
\v 4 There ariseth in the darkness a light to the upright: he is gracious, and merciful, and righteous. 
\v 5 Well will it be with the man who is kind, and lendeth: he will guide his affairs with justice. 
\v 6 Surely unto eternity shall he not be moved: in everlasting remembrance shall the righteous be held. 
\v 7 Of an evil report shall he not be afraid: his heart is firm, trusting in the Lord. 
\v 8 Well supported is his heart, he shall not be afraid, until he looketh on [the punishment of] his assailants. 
\v 9 He distributeth, he giveth to the needy: his righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted in honor. 
\v 10 The wicked shall see it, and be vexed; he will gnash with his teeth, and melt away: the longing of the wicked shall perish. 
\c 113  
\p
\v 1 Hallelujah. Praise, O ye servants of the Lord, praise ye the name of the Lord. 
\v 2 Let the name of the Lord be blessed from this time forth and for evermore. 
\v 3 From the rising of the sun unto his going down the name of the Lord is praised. 
\v 4 High above all nations is the Lord, above the heavens is his glory. 
\v 5 Who is like the Lord our God, who dwelleth on high? 
\v 6 Who condescendeth to view what is done in the heavens, and on the earth? 
\v 7 He raiseth up out of the dust the poor, from the dunghill he lifteth up the needy: 
\v 8 That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people. 
\v 9 He causeth the barren woman to dwell in the midst of [her] household, the joyful mother of children. Hallelujah. 
\c 114

\v 1 When Israel went forth out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of a strange language: 
\v 2 Judah became his sanctuary, [and] Israel his dominion. 
\v 3 The sea beheld it, and fled: the Jordan was driven backward. 
\v 4 The mountains skipped like wethers, the hills like lambs. 
\v 5 What aileth thee, O sea, that thou fleest? thou, O Jordan, that thou art driven backward? 
\v 6 Ye mountains, that ye skip like wethers? ye hills, like lambs? 
\v 7 At the presence of the Lord tremble, O earth, at the presence of the God of Jacob; 
\v 8 Who changeth the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a fountain of water. 
\c 115  
\p
\v 1 Not for our sake, O Lord, not for our sake, but unto thy name give glory, for the sake of thy kindness, for the sake of thy truth. 
\v 2 Wherefore should the nations say, Where now is their God? 
\v 3 Whereas our God is in the heavens: whatsoever he desireth hath he done. 
\v 4 Their idols are sliver and gold, the work of the hands of man. 
\v 5 A mouth they have, but speak not; eyes they have, but see not; 
\v 6 Ears they have, but hear not; a nose they have, but smell not. 
\v 7 They have hands, but they touch not; they have feet, but they walk not: nor do they give any utterance by their throat. 
\v 8 Like them are those that make them, every one that trusteth in them. 
\v 9 O Israel, trust thou in the Lord—he is their help and their shield. 
\v 10 O house of Aaron, trust ye in the Lord—he is their help and their shield. 
\v 11 Ye that fear the Lord, trust ye in the Lord—he is their help and their shield. 
\v 12 The Lord hath even been mindful of us, he will bless [us]; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron; 
\v 13 He will bless those that fear the Lord, the small together with the great. 
\v 14 May the Lord increase you more and more, you and your children. 
\v 15 Blessed are ye of the Lord, who made heaven and earth. 
\v 16 The heavens are the heavens of the Lord; but the earth hath he given to the children of men. 
\v 17 Not the dead can praise the Lord, nor all those that go down into the silence [of death]. 
\v 18 But as for us, we will bless the Lord from this time forth and for evermore. Hallelujah. 
\c 116  
\p
\v 1 It is lovely to me that the Lord heareth my voice, my supplications. 
\v 2 For he hath inclined his ear unto me: therefore throughout all my days will I call on him. 
\v 3 The bands of death had compassed me, and the pangs of the nether world had overtaken me; I had met with distress and sorrow: 
\v 4 I then called on the name of the Lord, I beseech thee, O Lord, release my soul. 
\v 5 Gracious is the Lord, and righteous; and our God is merciful. 
\v 6 The Lord preserveth the simple: I was in misery, and he helped me. 
\v 7 Return, O my soul, unto thy rest; for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee. 
\v 8 For thou hast delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from falling. 
\v 9 I will walk before the Lord in the land of life. 
\v 10 I believe, therefore will I speak: I was greatly afflicted; 
\v 11 I indeed said in my despondency, Every man is a liar. 
\v 12 What shall I give in return unto the Lord for all his bounties toward me? 
\v 13 The cup of salvation will I lift up, and on the name of the Lord will I call. 
\v 14 My vows will I pay unto the Lord, yea, in the presence of all his people. 
\v 15 Grievous in the eyes of the Lord is the death of his pious ones. 
\v 16 O Lord, truly am I thy servant, I am thy servant,—the son of thy handmaid: thou hast loosened my fetters. 
\v 17 Unto thee will I offer the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and on the name of the Lord will I call. 
\v 18 My vows will I pay unto the Lord, yea, in the presence of all his people, 
\v 19 In the courts of the house of the Lord, in thy midst, O Jerusalem. Hallelujah. 
\c 117  
\p
\v 1 Praise the Lord, all ye nations: praise him, all ye people. 
\v 2 For mighty is his kindness over us: and the truth of the Lord endureth for ever. Hallelujah. 
\c 118  
\p
\v 1 O give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good; because unto eternity endureth his kindness. 
\v 2 Let Israel then say so; because to eternity endureth his kindness. 
\v 3 Let the house of Aaron then say so; because to eternity endureth his kindness. 
\v 4 Let those who fear the Lord then say so; because to eternity endureth his kindness. 
\v 5 From the midst of distress I called on the Lord; the Lord answered me with enlargement. 
\v 6 The Lord is for me; I will not fear: what can a man do unto me? 
\v 7 The Lord is for me, among those that help me: therefore shall I indeed look on [the punishment of] those that hate me. 
\v 8 It is better to seek shelter with the Lord than to trust in man. 
\v 9 It is better to seek shelter with the Lord than to trust in princes. 
\v 10 All nations encompassed me about; but in the name of the Lord I will surely cut them off. 
\v 11 They encompassed me about: yea, they compassed about, but in the name of the Lord I will surely cut them off. 
\v 12 They encompassed me about like bees; they blazed up like the fire of thorns; but in the name of the Lord I will surely cut them off. 
\v 13 Thou hast thrust violently at me that I might fall; but the Lord assisted me. 
\v 14 My strength and song is the Lord, and he is become my salvation. 
\v 15 The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tents of the righteous: the right hand of the Lord doth valiantly. 
\v 16 The right hand of the Lord is exalted: the right hand of the Lord doth valiantly. 
\v 17 I shall not die, but I shall live, and relate the works of the Lord. 
\v 18 Severely hath the Lord chastised me; but unto death hath he not given me up. 
\v 19 Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will enter into them. I will give thanks unto the Lord. 
\v 20 This is the gate which belongeth unto the Lord, the righteous shall enter thereby. 
\v 21 I will thank thee: for thou but answered me, and art become my salvation. 
\v 22 The stone which the builders rejected is become the chief corner-stone. 
\v 23 From the Lord is this come to pass, it is marvelous in our eyes. 
\v 24 This is the day which the Lord hath made, we will be glad and rejoice thereon. 
\v 25 We beseech thee, O Lord, save [us] now: we beseech thee, O Lord, send [us] now prosperity. 
\v 26 Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord: we bless you out of the house of the Lord. 
\v 27 God is the Lord, and he giveth us light: bind the festive sacrifice with cords, [leading it] up to the horns of the altar. 
\v 28 Thou art my God, and I will thank thee: my God, I will exalt thee. 
\v 29 Oh give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good; because to eternity endureth his kindness.

\v 1 ALEPH. Happy are they whose way is perfect, who walk in the law of the Lord. 
\v 2 Happy are they who keep his testimonies, that seek him with all their heart. 
\v 3 They also commit no injustice; in his ways do they walk. 
\v 4 Thou thyself hast commanded us thy precepts, that we might keep [them] diligently. 
\v 5 Oh that my ways were firmly directed to observe thy statutes! 
\v 6 Then would I not be made ashamed, while I look at all thy commandments. 
\v 7 I will thank thee with uprightness of heart, when I learn thy righteous ordinances. 
\v 8 Thy statutes will I observe: oh forsake me not too greatly. 
\v 9 BETH. Wherewithal shall a youth keep his way pure? by guarding it according to thy word. 
\v 10 With all my heart have I sought thee: oh let me not wander astray from thy commandments. 
\v 11 In my heart have I treasured up thy saying, in order that I may not sin against thee. 
\v 12 Blessed art thou, O Lord: teach me thy statutes. 
\v 13 With my lips have I related all the ordinances of thy mouth. 
\v 14 On the way of thy testimonies have I been glad, as over all wealth. 
\v 15 On thy precepts will I meditate, and direct my look unto thy paths. 
\v 16 In thy statutes will I seek my delight: I will not forget thy word. 
\v 17 GIMEL. Deal bountifully with thy servant: let me live, that I may observe thy word. 
\v 18 Open thou my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law. 
\v 19 A stranger am I on the earth: hide not from me thy commandments. 
\v 20 My soul is broken from longing for thy ordinances at all times. 
\v 21 Thou hast rebuked the accursed proud, who go erringly astray from thy commandments. 
\v 22 Roll away from me reproach and contempt; for thy testimonies have I kept. 
\v 23 Although even princes should sit and speak against me, thy servant would still meditate on thy statutes. 
\v 24 Also thy testimonies are my delight, my counsellors. 
\v 25 DALETH. My soul cleaveth unto the dust: revive thou me according to thy word. 
\v 26 My ways do I relate [to thee], and thou answerest me: teach me thy statutes. 
\v 27 Cause me to understand the way of thy precepts, that I may meditate on thy wonders. 
\v 28 My soul droppeth away from grief: sustain me according to thy word. 
\v 29 The way of falsehood do thou remove from me, and grant me graciously thy law. 
\v 30 The way of truth have I chosen: thy ordinances have I set [before me]. 
\v 31 I have adhered unto thy testimonies: O Lord, put me not to shame. 
\v 32 The way of thy commandments will I run; for thou wilt enlarge my heart. 
\v 33 HE. Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy statutes, and I shall keep it in all its windings. 
\v 34 Give me understanding, that I may keep thy law, and I will observe it with all [my] heart. 
\v 35 Guide me on the path of thy commandments; for therein do I find my delight. 
\v 36 Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to desire for gain. 
\v 37 Turn away my eyes from beholding vanity: on thy way do thou give me life. 
\v 38 Fulfill unto thy servant thy promise for those who are devoted to thy fear. 
\v 39 Cause to pass away my disgrace of which I have dread; for thy ordinances are good. 
\v 40 Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: through thy righteousness do thou give my life. 
\v 41 VAV. And let thy kindness come unto me, O Lord, thy salvation, according to thy promise. 
\v 42 Then shall I have a word to answer the one that reproacheth me; for I trust in thy word. 
\v 43 And snatch not the word of truth out of my mouth too greatly; for I wait for thy ordinances. 
\v 44 So shall I observe thy law continually for ever and ever. 
\v 45 And I will walk in an open space; for thy precepts have I sought. 
\v 46 And I will speak of thy testimonies before kings, and will not be ashamed. 
\v 47 And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I love. 
\v 48 And so will I lift up my hands unto thy commandments, which I love, and I will meditate on thy statutes. 
\v 49 ZAYIN. Remember thy word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me to wait. 
\v 50 This is my comfort in my affliction, that thy promise hath revived me. 
\v 51 The presumptuous have held me too greatly in derision: yet have I not departed away from thy law. 
\v 52 I remembered thy decrees [which were] from olden times, O Lord, and thus comforted myself. 
\v 53 Horror seized on me because of the wicked that forsake thy law. 
\v 54 Songs have thy statutes been unto me in the house of my pilgrimage. 
\v 55 I remembered in the night thy name, O Lord, and observed thy law. 
\v 56 This came to pass unto me, because I had kept thy precepts. 
\v 57 CHETH. My portion is the Lord, have I said, that I might observe thy words. 
\v 58 I make entreaty before thee with all my heart: be gracious unto me according to thy promise. 
\v 59 I have thought over my ways, and made my feet return unto thy testimonies. 
\v 60 I hastened, and delayed not to observe thy commandments. 
\v 61 Companies of wicked men have surrounded me; but I have not forgotten thy law. 
\v 62 At midnights do I constantly rise to give thanks unto thee, because of thy righteous decrees. 
\v 63 An associate am I unto all that fear thee, and unto those that keep thy precepts. 
\v 64 Of thy kindness, O Lord, is the earth full: teach me thy statutes. 
\v 65 TETH. Thou hast shown goodness on thy servant, O Lord, according to thy word. 
\v 66 The best of discernment and knowledge do thou teach me; for in thy commandments do I believe. 
\v 67 Before I was afflicted I was in error; but now I observe thy saying. 
\v 68 Thou art good, and doing good: teach me thy statutes. 
\v 69 The presumptuous have invented falsehoods against me; but I will with all my heart indeed keep thy precepts. 
\v 70 Gross as fat is their heart; but I take truly delight in thy law. 
\v 71 It is well for me that I have been afflicted, in order that I might learn thy statutes. 
\v 72 Better is unto me the law of thy mouth than thousands of gold and silver. 
\v 73 YOD. Thy hands have made me and established me: give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments. 
\v 74 Those that fear thee will see me and be rejoiced; because I have waited for thy word. 
\v 75 I know, O Lord, that thy decrees are righteous, and that in faithfulness thou hast afflicted me. 
\v 76 Let, I pray thee, thy kindness come to comfort me, according to thy promise unto thy servant. 
\v 77 Let thy mercies come unto me, that I may live; for thy law is my delight. 
\v 78 Let the presumptuous be made ashamed; because they have without a cause dealt perversely with me; but I will indeed meditate on thy precepts. 
\v 79 Let those that fear thee return unto me, and those that know thy testimonies. 
\v 80 Let my heart be entire in thy statutes, in order that I may not be put to shame. 
\v 81 CAPH. My soul ardently desireth for thy salvation: for thy word do I wait. 
\v 82 My eyes look eagerly for thy promise, saying, When wilt thou comfort me? 
\v 83 For I am become like a bottle in the smoke: [yet] do I not forget thy statutes. 
\v 84 How many are the days of thy servant? when wilt thou execute justice on my persecutors? 
\v 85 The presumptuous have dug pits for me, which is not in accordance with thy law. 
\v 86 All thy commandments are founded on truth: without cause they persecute me; help thou me. 
\v 87 But little was wanting that they had consumed me upon earth; but I have truly not forsaken thy precepts. 
\v 88 According to thy kindness give me life, that I may observe the testimony of thy mouth. 
\v 89 LAMED. To eternity, O Lord, standeth firm thy word with the heavens. 
\v 90 Unto all generations endureth thy faithfulness: thou hast established the earth, and she standeth. 
\v 91 According to thy ordinances they exist this day: for all are thy servants. 
\v 92 Unless thy law had been my delights, I should long since have been lost in my affliction. 
\v 93 Never will I forget thy precepts; for with them thou hast kept me alive. 
\v 94 Thine am I, save me; for thy precepts have I sought. 
\v 95 Wicked men have waited for me to destroy me; [but] I will reflect on thy testimonies. 
\v 96 Of all perfection have I seen the end; [but] thy commandment is exceedingly extended. 
\v 97 MEM. Oh how do I love thy law! all the day is it my meditation. 
\v 98 Wiser than my enemy doth thy commandment make me; for it is perpetually with me. 
\v 99 Above all my teachers have I obtained intelligence; for thy testimonies are my meditation. 
\v 100 More than the elders do I possess understanding; because thy precepts do I keep. 
\v 101 From every evil path have I withholden my feet, in order that I might observe thy word. 
\v 102 From thy ordinances have I not departed; for thou hast instructed me. 
\v 103 How much sweeter are to my palate thy sayings than honey to my mouth! 
\v 104 Through thy precepts shall I obtain understanding: therefore do I hate every path of falsehood. 
\v 105 NUN. A lamp unto my feet is thy word, and a light unto my path. 
\v 106 I have sworn, and I will perform it, to observe thy righteous ordinances. 
\v 107 I am afflicted exceedingly much: O Lord, revive me, according to thy word. 
\v 108 Receive in favor the freewill-offerings of my mouth, I beseech thee, O Lord, and teach me thy ordinances. 
\v 109 My life is in my hand continually: yet thy law do I not forget. 
\v 110 The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet have I not erred from thy precepts. 
\v 111 I have taken thy testimonies as a heritage to eternity; for they are the joy of my heart. 
\v 112 I have inclined my heart to perform thy statutes always, in all their ways. 
\v 113 SAMECH. Those of divided thoughts I hate; but thy law do I love. 
\v 114 My shelter and my shield art thou: for thy word do I wait. 
\v 115 Depart from me, ye evildoers, that I may keep the commandments of God. 
\v 116 Uphold me according to thy promise, that I may live, and let me not be made ashamed of my hope. 
\v 117 Support me that I may be placed in safety, and I will direct my regard unto thy statutes continually. 
\v 118 Thou hast trodden down all that erringly stray from thy statutes; for falsehood is their deceit. 
\v 119 Like dross dost thou put away all the wicked of the earth: therefore do I love thy testimonies. 
\v 120 My flesh trembleth shudderingly from dread of thee, and of thy decrees am I afraid. 
\v 121 'AYIN. I have executed justice and righteousness: leave me not to those who oppress me. 
\v 122 Protect thy servant for good: let not the presumptuous oppress me.

\v 124 Deal with thy servant according to thy kindness, and thy statutes do thou teach me. 
\v 125 I am thy servant: give me understanding, that I may know thy testimonies. 
\v 126 It is time to act for the Lord: they have broken thy law. 
\v 127 Therefore do I love thy commandments more than gold, and more than fine gold. 
\v 128 Therefore do I esteem all thy precepts in all things as right: every path of falsehood do I hate. 
\v 129 PE. Wonderful are thy testimonies: therefore doth my soul keep them. 
\v 130 The opening of thy words giveth light, it giveth understanding unto the simple. 
\v 131 I opened my mouth, and panted for breath; because for thy commandments did I long. 
\v 132 Turn thou unto me, and be gracious unto me, as is thy wont unto those that love thy name. 
\v 133 My steps establish thou through thy promise, and suffer not any wrong to have dominion over me. 
\v 134 Deliver me from the oppression of man, and I will observe thy precepts. 
\v 135 Let thy face shine upon thy servant, and teach me thy statutes. 
\v 136 Streams of water have run down my eyes; because they had not observed thy law. 
\v 137 TZADDE. Righteous art thou, O Lord, and upright are thy decrees. 
\v 138 Thou hast commanded thy testimonies, as righteous and faithful exceedingly. 
\v 139 My zeal destroyeth me; because my assailants have forgotten thy words. 
\v 140 Thy promise is greatly refined, and thy servant loveth it. 
\v 141 I am little and despised: yet thy precepts have I not forgotten. 
\v 142 Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth. 
\v 143 Distress and trouble have overtaken me: [yet] are thy commandments my delights. 
\v 144 Righteous are thy testimonies for everlasting: give me understanding, that I may live. 
\v 145 KOPH. I have called with all my heart: answer me, O Lord: thy statutes will I keep. 
\v 146 I have called on thee, save me, and I will observe thy testimonies. 
\v 147 I come before thee in the dawn of morning, and cry: for thy word do I wait. 
\v 148 My eyes are awake before the night-watches, that I may meditate in thy saying. 
\v 149 Hear my voice according to thy kindness: O Lord, according to thy decree do thou grant me life. 
\v 150 They that pursue mischievous devices draw nigh: from thy law are they far. 
\v 151 Near art thou, O Lord; and all thy commandments are the truth. 
\v 152 Of old already I knew of thy testimonies; because for eternity hast thou founded them. 
\v 153 RESH. Look on my affliction, and release me; for thy law have I not forgotten. 
\v 154 Plead my cause, and deliver me: according to thy promise do thou revive me. 
\v 155 Far from the wicked is salvation; because thy statutes have they not sought for. 
\v 156 Thy mercies are abundant, O Lord; according to thy decrees do thou revive me. 
\v 157 Many are my persecutors and my assailants: yet from thy testimonies do I not turn away. 
\v 158 I beheld the treacherous, and felt disgust; because they observed not thy saying. 
\v 159 Behold that I love thy precepts: O Lord, according to thy kindness do thou revive me. 
\v 160 The summit of thy word is truth: and the whole of thy righteous judgment endureth for ever. 
\v 161 SHIN. Princes have persecuted me without a cause; but of thy word standeth my heart in dread. 
\v 162 I am rejoiced over thy promise, as one that findeth great spoil. 
\v 163 Falsehood I hate and abhor: but thy law do I love. 
\v 164 Seven times in the day do I praise thee because of thy righteous decrees. 
\v 165 Abundant peace have they who love thy law; and thee is nothing that causeth them to stumble. 
\v 166 I have hoped for thy salvation, O Lord, and thy commandments have I fulfilled.

\v 4 For thither go up the tribes of the Lord, as a testimony for Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the Lord. 
\v 5 For there are placed chairs for [giving] judgment, the chairs for the house of David.— 
\v 6 Pray ye for the peace of Jerusalem; may those that love thee prosper. 
\v 7 May there be peace within thy walls, prosperity within thy palaces, 
\v 8 For the sake of my brethren and my friends, let me now speak, Peace be within thee. 
\v 9 For the sake of the house of the Lord our God, will I seek thy good.

\v 1 “A song of the degrees.” Unto thee do I lift up my eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens. 
\v 2 Behold, as the eyes of servants are directed unto the hand of their masters, as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress: thus are our eyes directed unto the Lord our God, until he be gracious unto us. 
\v 3 Be gracious unto us, O Lord! be gracious unto us; for we are overburdened with contempt. 
\v 4 Our soul is overburdened with the scorn of those who are at ease, with the contempt of the proud oppressors. 
\c 124  
\p
\v 1 “A song of the degrees by David.” If it had not been the Lord who was for us, so should Israel say; 
\v 2 If it had not been the Lord who was for us, when men rose up against us: 
\v 3 Then would they have swallowed us up alive, when their wrath was kindled against us; 
\v 4 Then would the waters have overwhelmed us, the stream would have passed over our soul; 
\v 5 Then would have passed over our soul the presumptuous waters. 
\v 6 Blessed be the Lord, who hath not given us up as a prey to their teeth. 
\v 7 Our soul is escaped like a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped. 
\v 8 Our help is in the name of the Lord, the maker of heaven and earth. 
\c 125  
\p
\v 1 “A song of the degrees.” Those who trust in the Lord are like mount Zion, which will not he moved, which endureth for ever. 
\v 2 Jerusalem hath mountains round about her: and [so] is the Lord round about his people, from this time forth and for evermore. 
\v 3 For the sceptre of wickedness shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous: in order that the righteous may not stretch forth their hands unto wrong-doing. 
\v 4 Do good, O Lord, unto the good, and to those that are upright in their hearts. 
\v 5 But as for those who turn aside unto their crooked ways, them will the Lord drive away with the workers of wickedness; but peace shall be upon Israel. 
\c 126  
\p
\v 1 “A song of the degrees.” When the Lord bringeth back again the captivity of Zion, then shall we be like dreamers. 
\v 2 Then shall our mouth be filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then shall they say among the nations, Great things hath the Lord done for these. 
\v 3 Great things would the Lord have done for us, [whereat] we should be joyful. 
\v 4 Bring back again, O Lord, our captivity, like rivulets in arid land. 
\v 5 Those that sow in tears shall reap with joyful song. 
\v 6 He goeth forth indeed and weepeth, that beareth the seed for sowing; but he will surely come with joyful song when he beareth [home] his sheaves. 
\c 127  
\p
\v 1 “A song of the degrees for Solomon.” Unless the Lord do build the house, in vain labor they that build on it: unless the Lord guard the city, in vain is the watchman wakeful. 
\v 2 It is in vain for you to be early in rising, to be late in sitting up, eating the bread of painful toils; [for] so doth he give unto his beloved during sleep. 
\v 3 Lo, children are an inheritance from the Lord: a reward is the fruit of the body. 
\v 4 Like arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the children of youth. 
\v 5 Happy is the man that hath his quiver filled with them: they shall not be put to shame, when they do speak with the enemies in the gate. 
\c 128  
\p
\v 1 “A song of the degrees.” Happy is every one that feareth the Lord, that walketh in his ways. 
\v 2 When thou eatest the labor of thy hands: [then] wilt thou be happy, and it shall be well with thee. 
\v 3 Thy wife is [then] as a fruitful vine in the recesses of thy house: thy children, like olive-plants round about thy table. 
\v 4 Behold, truly thus shall be blessed the man that feareth the Lord. 
\v 5 May the Lord bless thee out of Zion: and see thou the happiness of Jerusalem all the days of thy life. 
\v 6 And see thou thy children's children: may there be peace upon Israel. 
\c 129  
\p
\v 1 “A song of the degrees.” Many a time have they assailed me from my youth, so should Israel say; 
\v 2 Many a time have they assailed me from my youth: yet have they not prevailed against me. 
\v 3 Upon my back have ploughmen ploughed; they have drawn long their furrows: 
\v 4 [Yet] the Lord is righteous; he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked. 
\v 5 May all be put to shame and turned backward that hate Zion; 
\v 6 May they become like the grass of the roofs, which withereth before it is pulled up; 
\v 7 Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor his arm he that bindeth sheaves. 
\v 8 Nor do they who pass by say, The blessing of the Lord be with you: we bless you in the name of the Lord. 
\c 130  
\p
\v 1 “A song of the degrees.” Out of the depths have I called thee, O Lord. 
\v 2 Lord, listen to my voice: let thy ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications. 
\v 3 If thou, Lord, shouldst treasure up iniquities, O Lord, who would be able to stand? 
\v 4 But with thee there is forgiveness, in order that thou mayest be feared. 
\v 5 I hope for the Lord, my soul doth hope, and for his word do I wait. 
\v 6 My soul [waiteth] for the Lord, more than they that watch for the morning expect the morning. 
\v 7 Let Israel wait for the Lord; for with the Lord there is kindness, and with him is redemption in abundance; 
\v 8 And he wilt surely redeem Israel from all his iniquities. 
\c 131  
\p
\v 1 “A song of the degrees by David.” O Lord, my heart was not haughty, nor were my eyes lofty: neither have I walked after matters too great, or those too wonderful for me. 
\v 2 Surely I have pacified and stilled my soul, like the suckling on its mother's breast: like a suckling is in me my soul. 
\v 3 Let Israel wait for the Lord from this time forth and for ever more. 
\c 132  
\p
\v 1 “A song of the degrees.” Remember, O Lord, unto David all his afflictions; 
\v 2 How he swore unto the Lord; how he vowed unto the mighty One of Jacob: 
\v 3 Surely, I will not enter into the tent of my house, nor ascend the couch of my repose; 
\v 4 I will not grant any sleep to my eyes, nor to my eyelids any slumber: 
\v 5 Until I shall have found out a place for the Lord, a dwelling-place for the mighty One of Jacob. 
\v 6 “Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we met with it in the fields of the forest: 
\v 7 let us then go into his dwelling: let us prostrate ourselves before his footstool.” 
\v 8 Arise, O Lord, unto thy resting-place: thou, and the ark of thy strength. 
\v 9 Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy pious servants shout for joy. 
\v 10 For the sake of David thy servant turn not away the face of thy anointed. 
\v 11 The Lord hath sworn unto David in truth; he will not turn from it: “From the fruit of thy body will I set [some one] on the throne to succeed thee. 
\v 12 If thy children will observe my covenant and this my testimony which I teach them: then also shall their children sit for evermore upon the throne to succeed thee.” 
\v 13 For the Lord hath made choice of Zion: he hath desired it as a habitation for himself. 
\v 14 This is my resting-place for evermore: here will I dwell; for I have desired it. 
\v 15 Her provision will I bless abundantly: her needy ones will I satisfy with bread. 
\v 16 And her priests will I clothe with salvation: and her pious ones shall shout aloud for joy. 
\v 17 There will I cause to grow a horn unto David: I arrange a lamp for my anointed. 
\v 18 His enemies will I clothe with shame; but upon himself shall his crown shine brilliantly. 
\c 133  
\p
\v 1 “A song of the degrees by David.” Behold, how good and how pleasant it is !!when brethren dwell closely together [in union]! 
\v 2 [It is] like the precious oil upon the head, running down upon the beard, yea, Aaron's beard, which runneth down upon the upper border of his garments; 
\v 3 Like the dew of Chermon, running down upon the mountains of Zion; for there hath the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for evermore. 
\c 134  
\p
\v 1 “A song of the degrees.” Arise! bless ye the Lord, all ye servants of the Lord that stand in the house of the Lord in the nights. 
\v 2 Lift up your hands toward the sanctuary, and bless the Lord. 
\v 3 May the Lord bless thee out of Zion, he that is the maker of heaven and earth. 
\c 135  
\p
\v 1 Hallelujah. Praise ye the name of the Lord; praise him, O ye servants of the Lord; 
\v 2 Ye that stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God. 
\v 3 Hallelujah; for the Lord is good: sing praises unto his name; for it is lovely. 
\v 4 For Jacob hath the Lord chosen unto himself, Israel, as his peculiar treasure. 
\v 5 For I well know that the Lord is great, and that our Lord is above all gods. 
\v 6 Whatsoever the Lord willeth, hath he done in the heavens, and on the earth, in the seas, and in all the deeps. 
\v 7 He causeth clouds to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings with the rain; he bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries. 
\v 8 [He it is] who smote the first-born of Egypt, both of man and of cattle; 
\v 9 Who sent signs and wonderful tokens into the midst of thee, O Egypt, against Pharaoh, and against all his servants; 
\v 10 Who smote many nations, and slew mighty kings; 
\v 11 Sichon the king of the Emorites, and 'Og the king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan; 
\v 12 And gave their land as an inheritance, an inheritance unto Israel his people. 
\v 13 O Lord, thy name [endureth] for ever: O Lord, thy memorial is throughout all generations. 
\v 14 For the Lord will espouse the cause of his people, and concerning his servants will he bethink himself. 
\v 15 The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of the hands of men. 
\v 16 Mouths they have, but they speak not; eyes they have, but they see not; 
\v 17 Ears they have, but they hear not; neither is there any breath in their mouth. 
\v 18 Like them are those that make them, every one that trusteth in them. 
\v 19 O house of Israel, bless ye the Lord; O house of Aaron, bless ye the Lord. 
\v 20 O house of Levi, bless ye the Lord; ye that fear the Lord, bless the Lord. 
\v 21 Blessed be the Lord out of Zion, even he that resideth at Jerusalem. Hallelujah. 
\c 136

\v 1 O give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good; for to eternity endureth his kindness. 
\v 2 O give thanks unto the God of gods; for to eternity endureth his kindness. 
\v 3 O give thanks to the Lord of lords; for to eternity endureth his kindness. 
\v 4 To him who doth great wonders alone; for to eternity endureth his kindness. 
\v 5 To him that made the heavens with understanding; for to eternity endureth his kindness. 
\v 6 To him that stretched out the earth above the waters; for to eternity endureth his kindness. 
\v 7 To him that made great lights; for to eternity endureth his kindness; 
\v 8 The sun for the rule by day; for to eternity endureth his kindness; 
\v 9 The moon and stars for the rule by night; for to eternity endureth his kindness. 
\v 10 To him that smote Egypt in their first-born; for to eternity endureth his kindness; 
\v 11 And brought out Israel from the midst of them; for to eternity endureth his kindness; 
\v 12 With a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm; for to eternity endureth his kindness. 
\v 13 To him who divided the Red Sea into parts; for to eternity endureth his kindness; 
\v 14 And caused Israel to pass through the midst of it; for to eternity endureth his kindness; 
\v 15 But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red Sea; for to eternity endureth his kindness. 
\v 16 To him who led his people through the wilderness; for to eternity endureth his kindness. 
\v 17 To him who smote great kings; for to eternity endureth his kindness; 
\v 18 And slew mighty kings; for to eternity endureth his kindness. 
\v 19 Even Sichon the king of the Emorites; for to eternity endureth his kindness; 
\v 20 And 'Og the king of Bashan; for to eternity endureth his kindness; 
\v 21 And gave their land as an inheritance; for to eternity endureth his kindness; 
\v 22 As an inheritance unto Israel his servant; for to eternity endureth his kindness; 
\v 23 Who hath in our low estate remembered us; for to eternity endureth his kindness; 
\v 24 And hath freed us from our assailants; for to eternity endureth his kindness; 
\v 25 Who giveth food unto all flesh; for to eternity endureth his kindness. 
\v 26 O give thanks unto the God of the heavens; for to eternity endureth his kindness.

\v 1 By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat, and we also wept when we remembered Zion. 
\v 2 Upon the willows in her midst had we hung up our harps. 
\v 3 For there our captors demanded of us the words of song; and those that mocked us, joy, [saying,] Sing for us one of the songs of Zion. 
\v 4 How should we sing the song of the Lord on the soil of the stranger? 
\v 5 If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, may my right hand forget—. 
\v 6 May my tongue cleave to my palate if I do not remember thee: if I recall not Jerusalem at the head of my joy. 
\v 7 Remember, O Lord, unto the children of Edom the day of Jerusalem; who said, Raze it, raze it, even to her very foundation. 
\v 8 O daughter of Babylon, who art wasted: happy he, that repayeth thee thy recompense for what thou hast done to us. 
\v 9 Happy he, that seizeth and dasheth thy babes against the rock.

\v 1 “By David.” I will praise thee with my whole heart: before [thee], O God, will I sing praise unto thee. 
\v 2 I will bow myself down before thy holy temple, and I will thank thy name for thy kindness and for thy truth; for thou hast magnified above all thy name thy promise. 
\v 3 On the day when I called didst thou answer me, and raise me up with strength in my soul. 
\v 4 All the kings of the earth will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, when they hear the promises of thy mouth. 
\v 5 And they will sing on the ways of the Lord; for great is the glory of the Lord. 
\v 6 For exalted is the Lord, yet doth he regard the lowly; but the proud he punisheth from afar. 
\v 7 If I should walk in the midst of distress, thou wilt revive me: against the wrath of my enemies wilt thou stretch forth thy hand, and thy right hand will save me. 
\v 8 The Lord will accomplish [all] in my behalf; O Lord, thy kindness endureth for ever: the works of thy own hands do not abandon. 
\c 139  
\p
\v 1 “To the chief musician, by David, a psalm.” O Lord! thou hast searched me through, and thou knowest [me]. 
\v 2 Thou indeed knowest my sitting down and my rising up, thou understandest my thinking while yet afar off. 
\v 3 My walking and my lying down hast thou limited, and with all my ways art thou acquainted. 
\v 4 For, while there is not a word on my tongue, lo, thou, O Lord, knowest it entirely. 
\v 5 Behind and before hast thou hedged me in, and thou placest upon me thy hand. 
\v 6 Too wonderful is such knowledge for me: it is too exalted, I cannot attain unto it. 
\v 7 Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee away from thy presence? 
\v 8 If I should ascend into heaven, thou art there; and if I should make my bed in the nether world, behold, thou art there. 
\v 9 If I should lift up the wings of the morning-dawn, if I should dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea: 
\v 10 Even there would thy hand lead me, and thy right hand would seize hold of me. 
\v 11 If I said, Surely darkness shall enshroud me, and into night [be turned] the light about me: 
\v 12 Yet even darkness can obscure nothing from thee; but the night will shine like the day; both the darkness and the light are alike [to thee]. 
\v 13 For thou possessest my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb. 
\v 14 I will thank thee therefore, that I am [so] fearfully [and] wonderfully made: wonderful are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well. 
\v 15 My being was not concealed from thee, when I was made in secret, when I was [so to say] embroidered in the lowest parts of the earth. 
\v 16 My undeveloped substance did thy eyes see; and in thy book were all of them written down—the days which have been formed, while yet not one of them was here. 
\v 17 And how precious are unto me thy thoughts, O God! how mightily great is their sum! 
\v 18 Should I count them, they would be more numerous than the sand: I awake, and I am still with thee. 
\v 19 If thou wouldst but slay the wicked, O God! and ye men of blood, depart from me. 
\v 20 Who speak of thee for a wicked end, thy enemies, that bear [thy name] for a vain purpose. 
\v 21 Behold, those that hate thee I ever hate, O Lord; and for those that rise up against thee do I feel loathing. 
\v 22 With the utmost hatred do I hate them: enemies are they become unto me. 
\v 23 Search me through, O God, and know my heart; probe me, and know my thoughts: 
\v 24 And see if there be a way of perverseness in me, and lead me on the way of eternity. 
\c 140

\v 1 “To the chief musician, a psalm of David.” (140:2) Deliver me, O Lord, from an evil man; from a man of violence do thou keep me; 
\v 2 (140:3) Who think over evil [resolves] in their heart, [who] every day are gathered together for war. 
\v 3 (140:4) They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent: the poison of the adder is under their lips. Selah. 
\v 4 (140:5) Preserve me, O Lord, from the hands of the wicked, from the man of violence do thou keep me, who think of overthrowing my steps. 
\v 5 (140:6) The proud have hidden a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the side of [my] track; traps have they set for me. Selah. 
\v 6 (140:7) I have said unto the Lord, Thou art my God: give ear, O Lord, to the voice of my supplications. 
\v 7 (140:8) O thou Eternal Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered my head on the day of battle. 
\v 8 (140:9) Grant not, O Lord, the longings of the wicked; suffer not his wicked device to succeed: lest they exalt themselves. Selah. 
\v 9 (140:10) [As for] the heads of those that encompass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them. 
\v 10 (140:11) Let burning coals be cast upon them: let them be thrown into the fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again. 
\v 11 (140:12) Let not the man of an [evil] tongue be established on the earth: may evil hunt down the violent man to his downfall. 
\v 12 (140:13) I know that the Lord will procure right for the afflicted, [and] justice for the needy. 
\v 13 (140:14) Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the upright shall dwell before thy presence.

\v 1 “A psalm of David.” O Lord, I call thee, hasten unto me: give ear unto my voice, when I call unto thee. 
\v 2 May my prayer be valued as incense before thee, the lifting up of my hands, as the evening offering. 
\v 3 Set, O Lord, a watch unto my mouth: keep a guard at the door of my lips. 
\v 4 Permit not my heart to incline after any evil thing, to practise deeds in wickedness with men that are doers of wrong: and let me not eat of their dainties. 
\v 5 If the righteous strike me, it is a kindness; and if he reprove me, it is [as] oil poured on the head, my head shall not refuse it; for yet my prayer also [is offered] in their sufferings. 
\v 6 Are their judges fallen down through means of a rock: then will they listen to my words; for they are pleasant. 
\v 7 As when one cutteth in and splitteth open the earth: so are our bones scattered for the mouth of the grave. 
\v 8 For unto thee, O Eternal Lord, are my eyes directed; in thee do I trust: pour not out my life. 
\v 9 Guard me from the power of the snare which they have laid for me, and the traps of the wrong-doers. 
\v 10 Let the wicked fall into their own nets, altogether—while I pass safely by.

\v 1 “A Maskil of David, when he was in the cave. A prayer.” (142:2) With my voice I cry unto the Lord: with my voice I make supplication unto the Lord. 
\v 2 (142:3) I pour out before him my grief: my distress I recite before him. 
\v 3 (142:4) When my spirit was overwhelmed within me—and thou knowest well my path—on the way whereon I desired to walk they had secretly laid a snare for me. 
\v 4 (142:5) Look to the right, and behold, yea, there is no man that recognizeth me: [every] refuge is lost to me; there is no one that careth for my soul. 
\v 5 (142:6) I cried unto thee, O Lord: I said, Thou art my refuge, my portion in the land of life. 
\v 6 (142:7) Listen unto my entreaty; for I am very miserable: deliver me from my pursuers; for they are too mighty for me. 
\v 7 (142:8) Bring forth out of prison my soul, that I may thank thy name: with me shall the righteous crown themselves, when thou wilt deal bountifully with me. 
\c 143  
\p
\v 1 “A psalm of David.” O Lord, hear my prayer, give ear to my supplications: in thy faithfulness answer me, in thy righteousness. 
\v 2 And enter not into judgment with thy servant; for no living man can be regarded righteous before thee. 
\v 3 For the enemy hath pursued my soul; he hath crushed to the ground my life; he hath made me dwell in darkness, as those that are dead eternally. 
\v 4 And my spirit within me is overwhelmed: in my bosom is my heart astounded. 
\v 5 I remember the days of olden times: I meditate on all thy doings: on the work of thy hands do I reflect. 
\v 6 I spread forth my hands unto thee: my soul [longeth] for thee, as a thirsty land. Selah. 
\v 7 Hasten, answer me, O Lord, my spirit falleth: hide not thy face from me, that I may not become like those that go down into the pit. 
\v 8 Cause me to hear in the morning thy kindness; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way whereon I should walk; for unto thee do I lift up my soul. 
\v 9 Deliver me, O Lord, from my enemies: by thee do I seek shelter. 
\v 10 Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God: thy spirit is good; guide me on a level land. 
\v 11 For thy sake, O Lord, revive me: in thy righteousness bring forth out of distress my soul. 
\v 12 And in thy kindness destroy my enemies, and annihilate all the adversaries of my soul; far I am thy servant. 
\c 144

\v 1 “By David.” Blessed be the Lord my Rock, who exerciseth my hands for the battle, my fingers for the war: 
\v 2 My kindness, and my strong-hold; my high tower, and my deliverer; my shield, and he in whom I trust; who subdueth my people under me. 
\v 3 Lord, what is man, that thou takest cognizance of him: the son of a mortal, that thou regardest him! 
\v 4 Man is like the breath: his days are like a passing shadow. 
\v 5 O Lord, bend thy heavens, and come down: touch the mountains, that they may smoke. 
\v 6 Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: send out thy arrows, and confound them. 
\v 7 Stretch out thy hands from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of the children of the stranger. 
\v 8 Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and whose right hand is the right hand of falsehood. 
\v 9 O God, a new song will I sing unto thee: upon the ten-stringed psaltery will I sing praises unto thee. 
\v 10 [Thou art he] that giveth victory unto kings: who riddeth David his servant from the evil-bringing sword. 
\v 11 Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of the children of the stranger, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and whose right hand is the right hand of falsehood. 
\v 12 So that our sons may be like plants, grown up in their youth: our daughters, like corner-pillars, sculptured in the model of a palace. 
\v 13 May our garners be full, furnishing all manner of store: our sheep bringing forth thousands and ten thousands in our open pastures. 
\v 14 May our oxen be strong to labor: may there be no breach, nor migration, nor loud complaint in our streets. 
\v 15 Happy the people, that fare thus: happy the people, whose God is the Lord.

\v 1 “A hymn of praise by David.” I will extol thee, my God, O king; and I will bless thy name for ever and ever. 
\v 2 Every day will I bless thee, and I will praise thy name for ever and ever. 
\v 3 Great is the Lord, and greatly praised, and his greatness is unsearchable. 
\v 4 One generation shall praise thy works to the other, and thy mighty acts shall they declare. 
\v 5 On the majestic glory of thy excellence, and on thy wondrous deeds will I meditate. 
\v 6 And of the might of thy terrible acts shall men converse: and thy greatness will I relate. 
\v 7 The memorial of thy abundant goodness shall they loudly proclaim, and they shall sing joyfully of thy righteousness. 
\v 8 Gracious and merciful is the Lord, long-suffering, and great in kindness. 
\v 9 The Lord is good to all, and his mercies are over all his works. 
\v 10 All thy works shall thank thee, O Lord; and thy pious servants shall bless thee. 
\v 11 Of the glory of thy kingdom shall they converse, and of thy might shall they speak: 
\v 12 To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom. 
\v 13 Thy kingdom is a kingdom of all eternities, and thy dominion [subsisteth] throughout all generations. 
\v 14 The Lord upholdeth all who are falling, and raiseth up all those who are bowed down. 
\v 15 The eyes of all wait hopefully upon thee, and thou givest them their food in its due season. 
\v 16 Thou openest thy hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing. 
\v 17 Righteous is the Lord in all his ways, and beneficent in all his works. 
\v 18 The Lord is nigh unto all those who call on him, to all who call on him in truth. 
\v 19 The desire of those who fear him will he fulfill, and their cry will he hear, and save them. 
\v 20 The Lord preserveth all those who love him; but all the wicked will he destroy. 
\v 21 The praise of the Lord shall my mouth speak: and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever. 
\c 146  
\p
\v 1 Hallelujah. Praise, O my soul, the Lord. 
\v 2 I will praise the Lord throughout my life: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being. 
\v 3 Put not your trust in princes, in the son of man, in whom there is no salvation. 
\v 4 When his spirit goeth forth, he returneth to his [native] earth: on that very day perish his thoughts. 
\v 5 [But] happy is he who hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is on the Lord his God; 
\v 6 Who hath made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that is therein; who keepeth truth for ever; 
\v 7 Who executeth justice for the oppressed: who giveth bread to the hungry: the Lord looseneth the prisoners; 
\v 8 The Lord causeth the blind to see; the Lord raiseth up those who are bowed down; the Lord loveth the righteous: 
\v 9 The Lord guardeth the strangers; the fatherless and widow he helpeth up; but the way of the wicked he maketh crooked. 
\v 10 The Lord will reign for ever, even thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Hallelujah. 
\c 147  
\p
\v 1 Hallelujah; for it is good to sing praises unto our God; for it is comely; [him] becometh praise. 
\v 2 The Lord buildeth up Jerusalem: the outcasts of Israel will he gather together; 
\v 3 He that healeth the broken-hearted, and bindeth up their hurts; 
\v 4 Who counteth the number of the stars; who calleth them all by [their] names. 
\v 5 Great is our Lord, and abundant in power: his understanding is immeasurable. 
\v 6 The Lord helpeth up the meek: he bringeth down the wicked to the ground. 
\v 7 Lift up a song unto the Lord with thanksgiving; sing praises unto our God with the harp; 
\v 8 Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who causeth grass to grow upon the mountains; 
\v 9 Who giveth to the beast its food, to the young ravens which cry. 
\v 10 Not in the strength of the horse hath he delight: nor in the [swiftness of the] legs of man taketh he pleasure. 
\v 11 The Lord taketh pleasure in those that fear him, that wait for his kindness. 
\v 12 Glorify, O Jerusalem, the Lord: praise thy God, O Zion. 
\v 13 For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed thy children in the midst of thee; 
\v 14 He who bestoweth peace in thy borders, who satisfieth thee with the best of wheat; 
\v 15 He who sendeth forth his decree unto the earth: how swiftly speedeth his word along! 
\v 16 He who dispenseth snow like wool; who streweth about the hoarfrost like ashes; 
\v 17 He who casteth down his ice like pieces: before his cold who can stand? 
\v 18 He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind to blow, and waters run along. 
\v 19 He declareth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his ordinances unto Israel. 
\v 20 He hath not done so unto any nation: and [his] ordinances— these they know not. Hallelujah. 
\c 148  
\p
\v 1 Hallelujah. Praise ye the Lord from the heavens: praise him in the heights. 
\v 2 Praise ye him, all his angels: praise ye him, all his hosts. 
\v 3 Praise ye him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars of light. 
\v 4 Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that are above the heavens. 
\v 5 Let them praise the name of the Lord; for he commanded and they were created. 
\v 6 And he established them for ever and to eternity: he gave a decree which none shall transgress. 
\v 7 Praise the Lord from the earth, ye sea-monsters, and all deeps; 
\v 8 Fire, and hail, snow, and vapor; thou storm-wind that fulfillest his word; 
\v 9 Ye mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars; 
\v 10 Ye beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and winged birds; 
\v 11 Ye kings of the earth, and all nations; ye princes, and all judges of the earth; 
\v 12 Young men and also virgins; old men, together with boys:— 
\v 13 Let them praise the name of the Lord; for his name alone is exalted; his majesty is above earth and heaven. 
\v 14 He also exalteth the horn of his people, a praise unto all his pious servants, [even] unto the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Hallelujah. 
\c 149  
\p
\v 1 Hallelujah. Sing unto the Lord a new song, his praise in the congregation of the pious. 
\v 2 Let Israel rejoice in his Maker: let the children of Zion exult in their King. 
\v 3 Let them praise his name in the dance: with the timbrel and harp let them sing praises unto him. 
\v 4 For the Lord taketh pleasure in his people; he will adorn the meek with salvation. 
\v 5 Let the pious be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon their couches. 
\v 6 The exalted praises of God are in their mouth, and a two-edged sword is in their hand; 
\v 7 To execute vengeance on the nations, and chastisements on the people: 
\v 8 To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron: 
\v 9 To execute upon them the judgment [which is] written: this is an honor for all his pious servants. Hallelujah. 
\c 150  
\p
\v 1 Hallelujah. Praise ye God in his sanctuary: praise him in the expansion of his power. 
\v 2 Praise him for his acts of might: praise him according to the abundance of his greatness. 
\v 3 Praise him with the blowing of the cornet: praise him with the psaltery and harp. 
\v 4 Praise him with the timbrel and dance: praise him with stringed instruments and pipe. 
\v 5 Praise him upon the clear-ringing cymbals: praise him upon the high-sounding cymbals. 
\v 6 Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
