\v 1 And the Lord spoke unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after their going out of the land of Egypt, saying, 
\v 2 Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, after their families, by the descent from their fathers, by numbering the names, every male according to their polls; 
\v 3 From twenty years old and upward, all that are able to go forth to war in Israel: these shall ye number according to their armies, thou and Aaron. 
\v 4 And with you there shall be one man each of every tribe; a man who is the head of his family division. 
\v 5 And these are the names of the men that shall stand with you; of Reuben: Elizur the son of Shedeur. 
\v 6 Of Simeon: Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai. 
\v 7 Of Judah: Nachshon the son of 'Amminadab. 
\v 8 Of Issachar: Nethanel the son of Zuar. 
\v 9 Of Zebulun: Eliab the son of Chelon. 
\v 10 Of the children of Joseph, of Ephraim: Elishama the son of 'Ammihud; of Menasseh: Gamliel the son of Pedahzur. 
\v 11 Of Benjamin: Abidan the son of Gidoni. 
\v 12 Of Dan: Achiezer the son of 'Ammishaddai. 
\v 13 Of Asher: Pagiel the son of 'Ochran. 
\v 14 Of Gad: Elyassaph the son of Deuel. 
\v 15 Of Naphtali: Achira the son of 'Enan. 
\v 16 These were the selected of the congregation, the princes of the tribes of their fathers; the heads of the thousands of Israel were they. 
\v 17 And Moses and Aaron took these men who are expressed by name: 
\v 18 And all the congregation they assembled together on the first day of the second month, and they were enrolled in the lists of their pedigrees after their families, by the descent from their fathers, by numbering the names, from twenty years old and upward, according to their polls. 
\v 19 As the Lord had commanded Moses, so did he number them in the wilderness of Sinai. 
\v 20 And there were of the children of Reuben the first-born of Israel, by their generations, after their families, by the descent from their fathers, by numbering the names according to their polls, every male from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war; 
\v 21 Those that were numbered of the tribe of Reuben, were forty and six thousand and five hundred. 
\v 22 Of the children of Simeon, by their generations, after their families, by the descent from their fathers, those that were numbered of them, by numbering the names according to their polls, every male from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war; 
\v 23 Those that were numbered of the tribe of Simeon, were fifty and nine thousand and three hundred. 
\v 24 Of the children of Gad, by their generations, after their families, by the descent from their fathers, by numbering the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;

\v 26 Of the children of Judah, by their generations, after their families, by the descent from their fathers, by numbering the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war; 
\v 27 Those that were numbered of the tribe of Judah, were seventy and four thousand and six hundred. 
\v 28 Of the children of Issachar, by their generations, after their families, by the descent from their fathers, by numbering the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war; 
\v 29 Those that were numbered of the tribe of Issachar, were fifty and four thousand and four hundred. 
\v 30 Of the children of Zebulun, by their generations, after their families, by the descent from their fathers, by numbering the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war; 
\v 31 Those that were numbered of the tribe of Zebulun, were fifty and seven thousand and four hundred. 
\v 32 Of the children of Joseph, namely, of the children of Ephraim, by their generations, after their families, by the descent from their fathers, by numbering the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war. 
\v 33 Those that were numbered of the tribe of Ephraim, were forty thousand and five hundred. 
\v 34 Of the children of Menasseh, by their generations, after their families, by the descent from their fathers, by numbering the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war; 
\v 35 Those that were numbered of the tribe of Menasseh, were thirty and two thousand and two hundred. 
\v 36 Of the children of Benjamin, by their generations, after their families, by the descent from their fathers, by numbering the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war; 
\v 37 Those that were numbered of the tribe of Benjamin, were thirty and five thousand and four hundred. 
\v 38 Of the children of Dan, by their generations, after their families, by the descent from their fathers, by numbering the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war; 
\v 39 Those that were numbered of the tribe of Dan, were sixty and two thousand and seven hundred. 
\v 40 Of the children of Asher, by their generations, after their families, by the descent from their fathers, by numbering the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war; 
\v 41 Those that were numbered of the tribe of Asher, were forty and one thousand and five hundred. 
\v 42 Of the children of Naphtali, by their generations, after their families, by the descent from their fathers, by numbering the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war; 
\v 43 Those that were numbered of the tribe of Naphtali, were fifty and three thousand and four hundred. 
\v 44 These are those that were numbered, whom Moses numbered with Aaron, and the princes of Israel, being twelve men; one man each for his family division were they. 
\v 45 Thus were all those that were numbered of the children of Israel, by the descent from their fathers, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war in Israel,— 
\v 46 Even all they that were numbered, were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty. 
\v 47 But the Levites, after the tribe of their fathers, were not numbered among them. 
\v 48 For the Lord had spoken unto Moses, saying, 
\v 49 Only the tribe of Levi shalt thou not number, and their sum shalt thou not take, among the children of Israel; 
\v 50 But thou shalt appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of the testimony, and over all its vessels, and over all things that belong to it: they shall carry the tabernacle, and all its vessels; and they shall minister unto it; and round about the tabernacle shall they encamp. 
\v 51 And when the tabernacle is to be carried forward, the Levites shall take it down; and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death. 
\v 52 And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, according to their armies. 
\v 53 But the Levites shall encamp round shout the tabernacle of the testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of the testimony. 
\v 54 And the children of Israel did so: all, just as the Lord had commanded Moses, so did they. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 
\v 2 Every man by his own standard, by the ensign of their family division, shall the children of Israel pitch their tent; at some distance round about the tabernacle of the congregation shall they encamp. 
\v 3 And they, who encamp on the east, toward the rising of the sun, shall be [those who belong to] the standard of the camp of Judah according to their armies: and the prince of the children of Judah shall be Nachshon the son of 'Amminadab. 
\v 4 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were seventy and four thousand and six hundred. 
\v 5 And those that encamp next unto him shall be the tribe of Issachar: and the prince of the children of Issachar shall be Nethanel the son of Zuar. 
\v 6 And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were fifty and four thousand and four hundred. 
\v 7 [Then] the tribe of Zebulun: and the prince of the children of Zebulun shall be Eliab the son of Chelon. 
\v 8 And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were fifty and seven thousand and four hundred. 
\v 9 All that were numbered of the camp of Judah were one hundred thousand and eighty thousand and six thousand and four hundred, according to their armies: they shall first set forward. 
\v 10 The standard of the camp of Reuben shall be on the south side, according to their armies: and the prince of the children of Reuben shall be Elizur the son of Shedeur. 
\v 11 And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were forty and six thousand and five hundred. 
\v 12 And those that encamp by him shall be the tribe of Simeon: and the prince of the children of Simeon shall be Shelumiel the son of 'Zurishaddai. 
\v 13 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were fifty and nine thousand and three hundred. 
\v 14 Then the tribe of Gad: and the prince of the sons of Gad shall be Elyassaph the son of Reuel. 
\v 15 And his host, and those who were numbered of them, were forty and five thousand and six hundred and fifty. 
\v 16 All that were numbered of the camp of Reuben were one hundred thousand and fifty and one thousand and four hundred and fifty, according to their armies; and as the second shall they set forward. 
\v 17 Then shall the tabernacle of the congregation, the camp of the Levites, set forward in the midst of the camps: as they encamp, so shall they set forward, every man in his place after their standards. 
\v 18 The standard of the camp of Ephraim shall be on the west side, according to their armies: and the prince of the sons of Ephraim shall be Elishama the son of 'Ammihud. 
\v 19 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were forty thousand and five hundred. 
\v 20 And by him shall be the tribe of Menasseh; and the prince of the children of Menasseh shall be Gamliel the son of Pedahzur. 
\v 21 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were thirty and two thousand and two hundred. 
\v 22 Then the tribe of Benjamin: and the prince of the sons of Benjamin shall be Abidan the son of Gidoni. 
\v 23 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were thirty and five thousand and four hundred. 
\v 24 All that were numbered of the camp of Ephraim were one hundred thousand and eight thousand and one hundred, according to their armies; and as the third shall they set forward. 
\v 25 The standard of the camp of Dan shall be on the north side, according to their armies: and the prince of the children of Dan shall be Achiezer the son of 'Ammishaddai. 
\v 26 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were sixty and two thousand and seven hundred. 
\v 27 And those that encamp by him shall be the tribe of Asher: and the prince of the children of Asher shall be Pagiel the son of 'Ochran. 
\v 28 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were forty and one thousand and five hundred. 
\v 29 Then the tribe of Naphtali: and the prince of the children of Naphtali shall be Achira the son of 'Enan. 
\v 30 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were fifty and three thousand and four hundred. 
\v 31 All those that were numbered of the camp of Dan were one hundred thousand and fifty and seven thousand and six hundred; the hindmost shall they set forward according to their standards. 
\v 32 These are those that were numbered of the children of Israel according to their family divisions: and all those that were numbered of the camps, according to their armies, were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty. 
\v 33 But the Levites were not numbered among the children of Israel; as the Lord had commanded Moses. 
\v 34 And the children of Israel did all just as the Lord had commanded Moses, so did they encamp by their standards, and so did they set forward every one after his family, by his division.

\p
\v 1 And these are the generations of Aaron and Moses, on the day that the Lord spoke with Moses on mount Sinai. 
\v 2 And these are the names of the sons of Aaron: the firstborn Nadab, and Abihu, Elazar, and Ithamar. 
\v 3 These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests that were anointed, who were consecrated to minister as priests. 
\v 4 And Nadab and Abihu died before the Lord, when they offered a strange fire before the Lord, in the wilderness of Sinai, and they had no children: and Elazar and Ithamar ministered as priests in the life-time of Aaron their father. 
\v 5 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 6 Bring the tribe of Levi near, and present the same before Aaron the priest, that they may serve him. 
\v 7 And they shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole congregation before the tent of the congregation, to do the service of the tabernacle. 
\v 8 And they shall keep all the vessels of the tent of the congregation, and the charge of the children of Israel, to do the service of the tabernacle. 
\v 9 And thou shalt give the Levites unto Aaron and to his sons: as associates are they given unto him out of the children of Israel. 
\v 10 And Aaron and his sons shalt thou instruct, that they shall guard well their priest's office; and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death. 
\v 11 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 12 And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from the midst of the children of Israel instead of every first-born that openeth the womb among the children of Israel; and the Levites shall be mine. 
\v 13 Because mine is every first-born; on the day when I smote every first-born in the land of Egypt I hallowed unto me every first-born in Israel, both man and beast: mine shall they be; I am the Lord. 
\v 14 And the Lord spoke unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying, 
\v 15 Number the children of Levi after their divisions, by their families; every male of them from a month old and upward shalt thou number. 
\v 16 And Moses numbered them according to the order of the Lord, as he had been commanded. 
\v 17 And these were the sons of Levi by their names: Gershon, and Kehath, and Merari. 
\v 18 And these are the names of the sons of Gershon after their families: Libni, and Shimi. 
\v 19 And the sons of Kehath after their families: 'Amram, and Yizhar, Chebron, and 'Uzziel. 
\v 20 And the sons of Merari after their families: Machli, and Mushi; these are the families of the Levites according to their family divisions. 
\v 21 Of Gershon: the family of the Libnites, and the family of the Shimites; these are the families of the Gershunites. 
\v 22 Those that were numbered of them, by the numbering of all the males from a month old and upward, even those that were numbered of them, were seven thousand and five hundred. 
\v 23 The families of the Gershunites used to encamp behind the tabernacle, westward. 
\v 24 And the prince of the family division of the Gershunites was Elyassaph the son of Lael. 
\v 25 And the charge of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of the congregation was the tabernacle and the tent, its covering, and the hanging for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, 
\v 26 And the hangings of the court, and the curtain for the door of the court, which is by the tabernacle and by the altar, round about, and its cords for all the service thereof. 
\v 27 And of Kehath: the family of the 'Amramites, and the family of the Yizharites, and the family of the Chebronites, and the family of the 'Uzzielites; these are the families of the Kehathites. 
\v 28 By the numbering of all the males, from a month old and upward, they were eight thousand and six hundred, keeping the charge of the sanctuary. 
\v 29 The families of the sons of Kehath used to encamp on the side of the tabernacle, southward. 
\v 30 And the prince of the division of the families of the Kehathites was Elizaphan the son of 'Uzziel. 
\v 31 And their charge was the ark, and the table, and the candlestick, and the altars, and the vessels of the sanctuary which are used for the service, and the vail, and all belonging thereto. 
\v 32 And the chief over the princes of the Levites was Elazar the son of Aaron the priest, having the oversight of those that kept the charge of the sanctuary. 
\v 33 Of Merari: the family of the Machlites, and the family of the Mushites; these are the families of Merari. 
\v 34 And those that were numbered of them, by the numbering of all the males, from a month old and upward, were six thousand and two hundred. 
\v 35 And the chief of the division of the families of Merari was Zuriel the son of Abichayil: they used to encamp on the side of the tabernacle, northward. 
\v 36 And under the custody and charge of the sons of Merari were the boards of the tabernacle, and its bars, and its pillars, and its sockets, and all its vessels, and all that belongeth thereto, 
\v 37 And the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets, and their pins, and their cords. 
\v 38 But those that encamped before the tabernacle toward the east, even before the tabernacle of the congregation toward the rising of the sun, were Moses, and Aaron, and his sons, keeping the charge of the sanctuary for the charge of the children of Israel; and the stranger that came nigh was to be put to death. 
\v 39 All that were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses numbered with Aaron, at the order of the Lord, according to their families, all the males from a month old and upward, were twenty and two thousand. 
\v 40 And the Lord said unto Moses, Number all the first-born males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward, and take the number of their names. 
\v 41 And thou shalt take the Levites for me, I am the Lord, instead of all the first-born among the children of Israel; and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the first-born among the cattle of the children of Israel. 
\v 42 And Moses numbered, as the Lord had commanded him, all the first-born among the children of Israel. 
\v 43 And all the first-born males, by the numbering of the names, from a month old and upward, of those that were numbered of them, were twenty and two thousand two hundred and seventy and three. 
\v 44 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 45 Take the Levites instead of all the first-born among the children of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle; and the Levites shall be mine: I am the Lord. 
\v 46 And [for] those that are to be redeemed, the two hundred and seventy and three of the first-born of the children of Israel, who are more than the Levites, 
\v 47 Thou shalt take five shekels apiece for the poll; after the shekel of the sanctuary shalt thou take, twenty gerahs to the shekel; 
\v 48 And thou shalt give unto Aaron and to his sons the money, [for] those who are to be redeemed of those that are over the number of them. 
\v 49 And Moses took the redemption-money of those that were over in number above those who were redeemed by the Levites: 
\v 50 Of the first-born of the children of Israel did he take the money; a thousand three hundred and sixty and five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary. 
\v 51 And Moses gave the money of those who were redeemed unto Aaron and unto his sons, by the order of the Lord; as the Lord had commanded Moses. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 
\v 2 Take the sum of the sons of Kehath from among the sons of Levi, after their families, by their divisions, 
\v 3 From thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old, all that are fitted for the service, to do work at the tabernacle of the congregation. 
\v 4 This shall be the service of the sons of Kehath at the tabernacle of the congregation: The most holy things. 
\v 5 And Aaron shall come with his sons, when the camp setteth forward, and they shall take down the vail of the separation, and cover therewith the ark of the testimony; 
\v 6 And they shall put over it a covering of badgers' skins, and they shall spread over all a cloth wholly of blue [woollen yarn], and they shall put in its staves. 
\v 7 And over the table of the showbread shall they spread a cloth of blue, and put thereon the dishes, and the spoons, and the tubes, and the staves of the covering; and the continual bread shall be thereon: 
\v 8 And they shall spread over them a cloth of scarlet, and cover the same with a covering of badgers' skins; and they shall put in its staves. 
\v 9 And they shall take a cloth of blue, and cover the candlestick of the lighting, and its lamps, and its tongs, and its snuff-dishes, and all the oil-vessels thereof, wherewith they minister by it: 
\v 10 And they shall put it and all its vessels within a covering of badgers' skins, and they shall put it upon a barrow. 
\v 11 And over the golden altar shall they spread a cloth of blue, and cover it with a covering of badgers' skins; and they shall put in its staves. 
\v 12 And they shall take all the vessels of the service, wherewith they minister in the sanctuary, and put them in a cloth of blue, and cover them with a covering of badgers' skins; and they shall put them on a barrow. 
\v 13 And they shall take away the ashes from the altar, and spread over it a cloth of purple; 
\v 14 And they shall put upon it all its vessels, wherewith they minister upon it, the fire-pans, the forks, and the shovels, and the basins, all the vessels of the altar; and they shall spread over it a covering of badgers' skins, and put in its staves. 
\v 15 And when Aaron and his sons have thus made an end of covering the sanctuary, and all the vessels of the sanctuary, when the camp is to set forward: then shall, after that, the sons of Kehath come to carry it; but they shall not touch any holy thing, lest they die; these are the things which the sons of Kehath are to carry at the tabernacle of the congregation. 
\v 16 And under the supervision of Elazar the son of Aaron the priest shall be the oil for the lighting, and the incense of spices, and the daily meat-offering, and the anointing-oil; the supervision of all the tabernacle, and of all that is therein, over the sanctuary, and over its vessels. 
\v 17 And the Lord spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 
\v 18 Do ye not cause the tribe of the families of the Kehathites to be cut off from among the Levites; 
\v 19 But thus do unto them, that they may live, and not die, when they approach unto the most holy things: Aaron and his sons shall go in, and appoint them, every one, to his service and to his burden; 
\v 20 That they may not go in to see when the holy things are covered, and die. 
\v 21 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 22 Take also the sum of the sons of Gershon, by their divisions, after their families; 
\v 23 From thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shalt thou number them; all that are fitted for the service, to do work in the tabernacle of the congregation. 
\v 24 This shall be the service of the families of the Gershunites, to serve, and to carry: 
\v 25 They shall carry the curtains of the tabernacle, and of the tent of the congregation, its covering, and the covering of the badgers' skins that is over it above, and the hanging for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, 
\v 26 And the hangings of the court, and the hanging for the door of the gate of the court, which is by the tabernacle and by the altar round about, and their cords, and all the vessels of their service; and all that is delivered to them shall they perform. 
\v 27 By the order of Aaron and his sons shall be all the service of the sons of the Gershunites, in all their carrying, and in all their service: and ye shall designate unto them in charge all which they have to carry. 
\v 28 This is the service of the families of the sons of the Gershunites at the tabernacle of the congregation; their charge shall be under the supervision of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest. 
\v 29 The sons of Merari, shalt thou number after their families, by their divisions; 
\v 30 From thirty years old and upward, even until fifty years old, shalt thou number them, every one that is fitted for the service, to do the work of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
\v 31 And this is what is confided to them to carry, regarding all their service at the tabernacle of the congregation: The boards of the tabernacle, and its bars, and its pillars, and its sockets, 
\v 32 And the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets, and their pins, and their cords, with all their instruments, and all which belongeth thereto; and by name shall ye designate [to them] the vessels which are confided to them to carry. 
\v 33 This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari, regarding all their service, at the tabernacle of the congregation, under the supervision of Ithamar the son of Aaron, the priest. 
\v 34 And Moses with Aaron and the princes of the congregation numbered the sons of the Kehathites after their families, and after their divisions, 
\v 35 From thirty years old and upward, even until fifty years old, every one that was fitted for the service, for the work at the tabernacle of the congregation. 
\v 36 And those that were numbered of them after their families were two thousand seven hundred and fifty. 
\v 37 These were they that were numbered of the families of the Kehathites, all that could do service at the tabernacle of the congregation, whom Moses with Aaron numbered by the order of the Lord through the hand of Moses. 
\v 38 And those that were numbered of the sons of Gershon, after their families, and after their divisions, 
\v 39 From thirty years old and upward, even until fifty years old, every one that was fitted for the service, for the work at the tabernacle of the congregation, 
\v 40 Even those that were numbered of them, after their families, after their divisions, were two thousand and six hundred and thirty. 
\v 41 These are they that were numbered of the families of the sons of Gershon, all that could do service at the tabernacle of the congregation, whom Moses with Aaron numbered by the order of the Lord. 
\v 42 And those that were numbered of the families of the sons of Merari, after their families, after their divisions, 
\v 43 From thirty years old and upward, even until fifty years old, every one that was fitted for the service, for the work at the tabernacle of the congregation. 
\v 44 Even those that were numbered of them after their families, were three thousand and two hundred. 
\v 45 These are those that were numbered of the families of the sons of Merari, whom Moses with Aaron numbered by the order of the Lord through the hand of Moses. 
\v 46 All those that were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses with Aaron and the chiefs of Israel numbered, after their families, and after their divisions, 
\v 47 From thirty years old and upward, even until fifty years old, every one that came to do the service of the ministry, and the service of the carrying at the tabernacle of the congregation, 
\v 48 Even those that were numbered of them, were eight thousand and five hundred and eighty. 
\v 49 By the order of the Lord through the hand of Moses, did he appoint them, every one to his proper service, and to his proper carrying: and they were numbered, as the Lord had commanded Moses. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Command the children of Israel, that they send out of the camp every leper, and every one that hath an issue, and whosoever is defiled by the dead: 
\v 3 Both male and female shall ye send out, to without the camp shall ye send them; that they defile not their camps, in the midst whereof I dwell. 
\v 4 And the children of Israel did so, and they sent them out to without the camp: as the Lord had spoken unto Moses, so did the children of Israel. 
\v 5 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 6 Speak unto the children of Israel, If any man or woman commit any sin against a fellow-man, thereby doing a trespass against the Lord, and this person thus become guilty: 
\v 7 Then shall they confess their sin which they have committed; and he shall make restitution for his trespass with the principal thereof, and its fifth part shall he add thereto, and give it unto him against whom he hath trespassed. 
\v 8 But if the man have no kinsman to whom restitution could be made for the trespass, then shall the trespass which is restored unto the Lord, belong to the priest; besides the ram of the atonement, whereby an atonement shall be made for him. 
\v 9 And every offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they bring unto the priest, shall be his. 
\v 10 And every man's hallowed things shall be his: whatsoever any man giveth to the priest, shall belong to him. 
\v 11 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 12 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If the wife of any man go aside, and commit a trespass against him, 
\v 13 And a man lie with her carnally, and it be hidden from the eyes of her husband, because she hath been secretly defiled; and there be no witness against her, and she have not been detected and in the fact; 
\v 14 And the spirit of jealousy come over him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she have been defiled; or the spirit of jealousy come over him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she have not been defiled: 
\v 15 Then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, and he shall bring her offering for her, the tenth part of an ephah of barley-meal; he shall not pour any oil upon it, nor put any frankincense thereupon; for it is a meat-offering of jealousy, a meat-offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance. 
\v 16 And the priest shall bring her near, and place her before the Lord; 
\v 17 And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take, and put it into the water; 
\v 18 And the priest shall place the woman before the Lord, and uncover the woman's head, and put upon her hands the meat-offering of memorial, it is the meat-offering of jealousy; and in the hand of the priest shall be the bitter waters that bring the curse. 
\v 19 And the priest shall charge her by an oath, and he shall say unto the woman, If no man have lain with thee, and if thou hast not gone aside to uncleanness behind thy husband: then be thou free from these bitter waters that bring the curse. 
\v 20 But if thou hast gone aside behind thy husband, and if thou hast been defiled, and some man have lain with thee besides thy husband:— 
\v 21 And the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of imprecation, and the priest shall say unto the woman, The Lord then make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when the Lord doth cause thy thigh to fall away, and thy belly to swell; 
\v 22 And these waters that bring the curse shall go into thy bowels, to cause the belly to swell, and the thigh to fall away; and the woman shall say, Amen, amen. 
\v 23 And the priest shall write these curses on a roll, and he shall blot them out with the bitter waters. 
\v 24 And he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter waters that bring the curse: and the waters that bring the curse shall enter into her for bitterness. 
\v 25 And the priest shall take out of the woman's hand the meat-offering of jealousy, and he shall wave the meat-offering before the Lord, and bring it near to the altar: 
\v 26 And the priest shall take a handful from the meat-offering, as its memorial, and burn it upon the altar, and after that shall he cause the woman to drink the water. 
\v 27 And when he hath made her drink the water, then shall it come to pass, if she have been defiled, and have committed a trespass against her husband, that the waters that bring the curse shall enter into her, for bitterness, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall fall away; and the woman shall become a curse among her people. 
\v 28 And if the woman have not been defiled, but be clean: then shall she remain unharmed, and she shall conceive seed. 
\v 29 This is the law of jealousies, when a woman goeth aside behind her husband, and hath been defiled; 
\v 30 Or when the spirit of jealousy cometh over him, and he be jealous of his wife; and he shall place the woman before the Lord, and the priest shall do unto her altogether according to this law. 
\v 31 And the man shall be guiltless from iniquity; but this woman shall bear her iniquity. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When either man or woman pronounce an especial vow, the vow of a Nazarite, to be abstinent in honor of the Lord: 
\v 3 Then shall he abstain from wine and strong drink, vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink shall he not drink, and any infusion of grapes shall he not drink, and grapes, fresh or dried, shall he not eat. 
\v 4 All the days of his abstinence shall he eat nothing that is made of the grape-vine, from the kernels even to the husk. 
\v 5 All the days of the vow of his abstinence no razor shall pass over his head: until the days be completed, in which he abstaineth in honor of the Lord, shall he be holy, letting grow untouched the hair of his head. 
\v 6 All the days of his abstinence in honor of the Lord shall he not come near any dead body. 
\v 7 On his father, or on his mother, on his brother, or on his sister, shall he not make himself unclean, when they die; because the consecration of his God is upon his head. 
\v 8 All the days of his abstinence is he holy unto the Lord. 
\v 9 And if some one die very suddenly by him, and he thus defile his consecrated head: then shall he shave his head on the day of his being cleansed, on the seventh day shall he shave it. 
\v 10 And on the eighth day shall he bring two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: 
\v 11 And the priest shall prepare the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, and make an atonement for him, because he hath sinned through the dead; and he shall hallow his head on that same day. 
\v 12 And he shall consecrate unto the Lord [again] the days of his abstinence, and he shall bring a sheep of the first year for a trespass-offering; but the prior days shall not be counted, because his consecration hath been defiled. 
\v 13 And this is the law of the Nazarite: On the day when the days of his abstinence are completed, shall he present himself at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation; 
\v 14 And he shall bring his offering unto the Lord, one male sheep of the first year without blemish for a burnt-offering, and one ewe of the first year without blemish for a sin-offering, and one ram without blemish for a peace-offering, 
\v 15 And a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil; and their meat-offering, and their drink-offerings. 
\v 16 And the priest shall bring them near before the Lord, and he shall prepare his sin-offering, and his burnt-offering: 
\v 17 And the ram shall he prepare for a sacrifice of peace-offering unto the Lord, with the basket of unleavened bread; and the priest shall prepare his meat-offering and his drink-offering. 
\v 18 And the Nazarite shall shave at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation his consecrated head; and he shall take the hair of his consecrated head, and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace-offering. 
\v 19 And the priest shall take the shoulder of the ram when it is cooked, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and he shall put them upon the hands of the Nazarite, after he hath shaved his consecrated [head]. 
\v 20 And the priest shall make with them a waving before the Lord; it is a holy gift for the priest, together with the breast that was waved and the shoulder that was lifted up: and after that may the Nazarite drink wine. 
\v 21 This is the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed; his offering unto the Lord for his abstinence, besides that which he may be able to give: according to his vow which he may vow, so must he do in addition to what is required by the law of his abstinence. 
\v 22 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 23 Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, Thus shall ye bless the children of Israel, saying unto them, 
\v 24 The Lord bless thee, and preserve thee; 
\v 25 The Lord make his face shine unto thee, and be gracious to thee; 
\v 26 The Lord lift up his countenance unto thee, and give thee peace. 
\v 27 And they shall put my name upon the children of Israel: and I will bless them. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass on the day that Moses had finally set up the tabernacle, and had anointed, and sanctified it, and all its vessels, as also the altar and all its vessels, and had anointed them, and sanctified them: 
\v 2 That the princes of Israel, the heads of their family divisions, who were the princes of the tribes, the same who had superintended the numbering, offered. 
\v 3 And they brought their offering before the Lord, six covered wagons, and twelve oxen; a wagon for two princes, and an ox for each one: and they presented them before the tabernacle. 
\v 4 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 5 Take it from them, that they may be used to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; and thou shalt give them unto the Levites, to every man according to his service. 
\v 6 And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them unto the Levites. 
\v 7 Two of the wagons and four of the oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon, according to their service: 
\v 8 And four of the wagons and eight of the oxen he gave unto the sons of Merari, according to their service, under the supervision of Ithamar, the son of Aaron the priest. 
\v 9 But unto the sons of Kehath he gave none; because the service of the sanctuary belonged unto them, they were to bear upon their shoulders. 
\v 10 The princes also offered for the dedicating of the altar on the day that it was anointed; and the princes presented their offering before the altar. 
\v 11 And the Lord said unto Moses, One prince each on a given day, shall they offer their offering, for the dedication of the altar.

\v 89 And when Moses went into the tabernacle of the congregation to speak with Him, then heard he the voice speaking unto him from off the mercy-seat that was upon the ark of testimony, from between the two cherubim: and thus he spoke unto him. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Speak unto Aaron, and say unto him, When thou lightest the lamps, then shall the seven lamps give light toward the body of the candlestick. 
\v 3 And Aaron did so; toward the body of the candlestick did he light its lamps; as the Lord had commanded Moses. 
\v 4 And this was the workmanship of the candlestick: It was of beaten gold, from the shaft thereof, unto the flowers thereof, it was beaten work; according unto the pattern which the Lord had shown Moses, so made he the candlestick. 
\v 5 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 6 Take the Levites from the midst of the children of Israel, and cleanse them. 
\v 7 And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: Sprinkle upon them water of purification, after they have let the razor pass over all their flesh, and then let them wash their clothes, and so shall they be clean. 
\v 8 And they shall take a young bullock with his meat-offering, fine flour mingled with oil; and another young bullock shalt thou take for a sin-offering. 
\v 9 And thou shalt bring near the Levites before the tabernacle of the congregation: and thou shalt assemble together the whole congregation of the children of Israel. 
\v 10 And when thou hast brought near the Levites before the Lord, then shall the children of Israel lay their hands upon the Levites: 
\v 11 And Aaron shall make with the Levites a waving before the Lord from the children of Israel, that they may be ready to execute the service of the Lord. 
\v 12 And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks: and thou shalt prepare the one as a sin-offering, and the other as a burnt-offering, unto the Lord, to make an atonement for the Levites. 
\v 13 And thou shalt place the Levites before Aaron and before his sons, and make with them a waving before the Lord. 
\v 14 Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from the midst of the children of Israel: and the Levites shall be mine. 
\v 15 And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation: after thou shalt have cleansed them, and made with them a waving. 
\v 16 For they are wholly given unto me from the midst of the children of Israel: instead of every one that openeth the womb, of every first-born of the children of Israel, have I taken them unto me. 
\v 17 For mine are all the first-born of the children of Israel, both of man and beast: on the day that I smote every first-born in the land of Egypt did I sanctify them unto myself. 
\v 18 And I have taken the Levites, instead of all the first-born among the children of Israel. 
\v 19 And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from the midst of the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation, and to make an atonement for the children of Israel; that there be no plague among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel come nigh unto the sanctuary. 
\v 20 And so did Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of Israel, to the Levites: according unto all that the Lord had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did the children of Israel unto them. 
\v 21 And the Levites purified themselves, and they washed their clothes; and Aaron made with them a waving before the Lord: and Aaron made an atonement for them to cleanse them. 
\v 22 And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the tabernacle of the congregation before Aaron, and before his sons: as the Lord had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did they unto them. 
\v 23 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 24 This shall be the rule for the Levites: From twenty and five years old and upward shall he go into the ranks to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; 
\v 25 And from the age of fifty years shall he go out of the ranks of the service, and he shall serve no more; 
\v 26 But he shall wait on his brethren in the tabernacle of the congregation, to keep the charge, but the service shall he not perform; thus shalt thou do unto the Levites in the discharge of their office. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spoke unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the second year after their coming out of the land of Egypt, in the first month, saying, 
\v 2 That the children of Israel shall prepare the passover-lamb at its appointed season. 
\v 3 On the fourteenth day of this month, toward evening, shall ye prepare it at its appointed season: according to all its ordinances, and according to all its prescribed rules, shall ye prepare it. 
\v 4 And Moses spoke unto the children of Israel, that they should prepare the passover-lamb. 
\v 5 And they prepared the passover-lamb on the fourteenth day of the first month toward evening in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the Lord had commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel. 
\v 6 But there were certain men, who had been defiled by the dead body of a man, and they could not prepare the passover-lamb on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day. 
\v 7 And these men said unto him, We are defiled by the dead body of a man: wherefore shall we be kept back, so as not to offer the sacrifice of the Lord at its appointed season in the midst of the [other] children of Israel? 
\v 8 And Moses said unto them, Wait ye, and I will hear what the Lord will command concerning you. 
\v 9 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 10 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man whatever should be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be on a distant journey, among you or your posterity: yet shall he prepare the passover-lamb unto the Lord; 
\v 11 In the second month on the fourteenth day toward evening shall they prepare it, with unleavened bread and bitter herbs shall they eat it. 
\v 12 They shall leave none of it until morning, and no bone shall they break on it: according to the whole ordinance of the passover-lamb shall they prepare it. 
\v 13 But the man that is clean, and is not on a journey, and forbeareth to prepare the passover-lamb, even that same soul shall be cut off from his people; because the offering of the Lord hath he not brought at its appointed season, his sin shall that man bear. 
\v 14 And if a stranger sojourn among you, and will prepare the passover-lamb unto the Lord: according to the ordinance of the passover-lamb, and according to its prescribed rule, so shall he prepare it; one statute shall be for you, both for the stranger, and for the native born in the land. 
\v 15 And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle of the tent of the testimony: and in the evening there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until morning. 
\v 16 So it used to be always: the cloud covered it [by day], and the appearance of fire by night. 
\v 17 And as the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that did the children of Israel journey forward: and in the place where the cloud halted, there did the children of Israel encamp. 
\v 18 At the order of the Lord did the children of Israel journey forward, and at the order of the Lord they encamped: all the days that the cloud abode upon the tabernacle did they remain in camp. 
\v 19 And when the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle many days, then did the children of Israel keep the charge of the Lord, and journeyed not forward. 
\v 20 And at times it was, that the cloud remained but a few days upon the tabernacle; at the order of the Lord they abode in camp, and at the order of the Lord they journeyed forward. 
\v 21 And at times it was, that the cloud remained from evening until morning; and when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they journeyed forward; or a day and a night, and when the cloud was taken up, they journeyed forward; 
\v 22 Or two days, or a month, or a year; so long as the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, to remain thereon, did the children of Israel remain encamped, and journeyed not forward; but when it was taken up, they journeyed forward. 
\v 23 At the order of the Lord they remained in camp, and at the order of the Lord they journeyed forward: the charge of the Lord they kept, at the order of the Lord by the hand of Moses. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Make unto thyself two trumpets of silver, beaten out of one piece shalt thou make them; and they shall serve thee for the calling of the congregation, and for the setting forward of the camps. 
\v 3 And when they shall blow with both, all the congregation shall assemble themselves unto thee at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
\v 4 And if they blow with but one, then shall assemble themselves unto thee the princes, the heads of the thousands of Israel. 
\v 5 And when ye blow an alarm, then shall set forward the camps that encamp on the east side. 
\v 6 And when ye blow an alarm the second time, then shall set forward the camps that encamp on the south side: an alarm shall they blow for their setting forward. 
\v 7 But at the assembling of the assembly, ye shall blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm. 
\v 8 And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations. 
\v 9 And if ye go to war in your land against the oppressor that oppresseth you, then shall ye blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before the Lord your God, and ye shall be saved from your enemies. 
\v 10 And on the day of your gladness, and on your appointed festivals, and on the beginnings of your months, shall ye blow with the trumpets over your burnt-offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace-offerings; and they shall be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the Lord your God. 
\v 11 And it came to pass in the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony. 
\v 12 And the children of Israel set forward on their journeys from the wilderness of Sinai, and the cloud halted in the wilderness of Paran. 
\v 13 And they set forward for the first time at the order of the Lord by the hand of Moses. 
\v 14 And the standard of the camp of the children of Judah set forward at the first, according to their armies: and over their host was Nachshon the son of 'Amminadab. 
\v 15 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was Nethanel the son of Zuar. 
\v 16 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Chelon. 
\v 17 And [in the mean time] the tabernacle was taken down; and then set forward the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, the bearers of the tabernacle. 
\v 18 Then set forward the standard of the camp of Reuben, according to their armies: and over their host was Elizur the son of Shedeur. 
\v 19 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai. 
\v 20 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was Elyassaph the son of Deuel. 
\v 21 And then set forward the Kehathites, the bearers of the sanctuary: and the others set up the tabernacle against they came. 
\v 22 Then set forward the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim according to their armies; and over their host was Elishama the son of 'Ammihud. 
\v 23 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Menasseh was Gamliel the son of Pedahzur. 
\v 24 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gidoni. 
\v 25 Then set forward the standard of the camp of the children of Dan, the rereward of all the camps, according to their hosts: and over their host was Achiezer the son of 'Ammishaddai. 
\v 26 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel the son of 'Ochran. 
\v 27 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Achira the son of 'Enan. 
\v 28 In this order were the journeyings of the children of Israel according to their armies, when they set forward. 
\v 29 And Moses said unto Chobab, the son of Reuel the Midianite, the father-in-law of Moses, We are journeying unto the place of which the Lord hath said, This will I give unto you: come thou with us, and we will do thee good; for the Lord hath spoken [to bring] good upon Israel. 
\v 30 And he said unto him, I will not go; but to my own land, and to my birthplace will I go. 
\v 31 And he said, Do not, I pray thee, leave us; since thou didst find out the places where we were to encamp in the wilderness, and thou hast been to us instead of eyes. 
\v 32 And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that the same goodness which the Lord may do unto us, will we do unto thee. 
\v 33 And they set forward from the mount of the Lord a three days' journey; and the ark of the covenant of the Lord went before them in the three days' journey, to search out for them a resting-place. 
\v 34 And the cloud of the Lord was over them by day, when they set forward from the camp. 
\v 35 And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, Lord, and let thy enemies be scattered; and let those that hate thee flee before thy face. 
\v 36 And when it rested, he said, Return, O Lord, among thy myriads of the thousands of Israel. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass that as the people complained in a manner displeasing in the ears of the Lord, the Lord heard it, and his anger was kindled, and the fire of the Lord burnt among them, and consumed at the uttermost part of the camp. 
\v 2 And the people then cried unto Moses; and Moses prayed unto the Lord, and the fire disappeared. 
\v 3 And he called the name of the place Tab'erah; because the fire of the Lord had burnt among them. 
\v 4 And the mixed multitude that was among them felt a lustful longing: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who will give us flesh to eat? 
\v 5 We remember the fish, which we could eat in Egypt for naught; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic; 
\v 6 But now our soul is faint: there is nothing at all, only to the manna are our eyes [directed]. 
\v 7 But the manna was like coriander-seed, and its color as the color of the bdellium. 
\v 8 The people went about and gathered it, and ground it in a mill, or pounded it in a mortar, and boiled it in a pot, or made cakes of it: and its taste was as the taste of cakes mixed with oil. 
\v 9 And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it. 
\v 10 And Moses heard the people weep according to their families, every man at the door of his tent: and the anger of the Lord was kindled greatly; and in the eyes of Moses also was it displeasing. 
\v 11 And Moses said unto the Lord, Wherefore hast thou done evil to thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favor in thy eyes, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me? 
\v 12 Was it I who have conceived all this people? or was it I who have begotten them? that thou shouldst say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the sucking child, unto the land which thou hast sworn unto their fathers? 
\v 13 Whence shall I obtain flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep around me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat. 
\v 14 I am not able by myself alone to bear all this people, because it is too heavy for me. 
\v 15 And if thou wilt thus deal with me, then slay me, I pray thee, at once, if I have found favor in thy eyes: that I may not see my wretchedness. 
\v 16 And the Lord said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and its officers; and take them unto the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall stand there with thee. 
\v 17 And I will come down and speak with thee there: and I will take some of the spirit which is upon thee, and I will put it upon them; and they shall bear with thee the burden of the people, and thou shalt not bear it by thyself alone. 
\v 18 And unto the people shalt thou say, Hold yourselves ready against tomorrow, that ye may eat flesh; for ye have wept in the ears of the Lord, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was better with us in Egypt: thus will the Lord give you flesh, and ye shall eat. 
\v 19 Not one day shall ye eat, nor two days, nor five days, nor ten days, nor twenty days; 
\v 20 But up to a full month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it become loathsome unto you; because that ye have despised the Lord who is in the midst of you, and ye have wept before him, saying, Why did we come forth out of Egypt? 
\v 21 And Moses said, Six hundred thousand men on foot is the people, in the midst of whom I am; and yet thou hast said, Flesh will I give them, that they may eat a whole month. 
\v 22 Shall flocks and herds be slain for them, that they may suffice for them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, that they may suffice for them? 
\v 23 And the Lord said unto Moses, Should the Lord's hand be too short? now shalt thou see whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not. 
\v 24 And Moses went out, and spoke to the people the words of the Lord; and he assembled seventy men from the elders of the people, and placed them round about the tabernacle. 
\v 25 And the Lord came down in a cloud and spoke unto him; and he took some of the spirit that was upon him, and put it upon the seventy men, the elders: and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, but they did not so any more. 
\v 26 And there remained two men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad; and the spirit rested upon them; and they were of those that were written down, but they had not gone out unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp. 
\v 27 And there ran a young man, and told to Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp. 
\v 28 And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses from his youth, answered and said, My Lord Moses, forbid them. 
\v 29 And Moses said unto him, Art thou zealous for my sake? And oh that one might render all the people of the Lord prophets, that the Lord would put his spirit upon them! 
\v 30 And Moses retired back into thy camp, he with the elders of Israel. 
\v 31 And a wind went forth from the Lord, and drove up quails from the sea, and scattered them over the camp, about a day's journey on this side, and about a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and about two cubits high over the face of the earth. 
\v 32 And the people arose all that day, and all that night, and all the following day, and they gathered the quails; he that had taken the least, had gathered ten chomers: and they spread them out for themselves round about the camp. 
\v 33 The flesh was yet between their teeth, it was not yet chewed: when the wrath of the Lord was kindled against the people, and the Lord smote among the people a very great plague. 
\v 34 And he called the name of that place Kibroth-hattaavah; because there they buried the people that had lustfully craved. 
\v 35 From Kibroth-hattaavah the people journeyed unto Chazeroth; and they remained at Chazeroth. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses, on account of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married; for an Ethiopian woman had he married. 
\v 2 And they said, Hath then only with Moses the Lord spoken? hath he not also spoken with us? And the Lord heard it. 
\v 3 (But the man Moses was very meek, more so than any man who was upon the face of the earth.) 
\v 4 And the Lord said suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam, Go out ye three unto the tabernacle of the congregation; and these three went out. 
\v 5 And the Lord came down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the door of the tabernacle; and he called Aaron and Miriam, and both of them went out. 
\v 6 And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet of your kind, I, the Lord, do make myself known unto him in a vision, in a dream do I speak with him. 
\v 7 Not so is my servant Moses, in all my house is he faithful. 
\v 8 Mouth to mouth do I speak with him, even evidently, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the Lord doth he behold: wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant, against Moses? 
\v 9 And the anger of the Lord was kindled against them, and he went away. 
\v 10 And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold, Miriam became leprous, [white] as snow; and Aaron turned toward Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous. 
\v 11 Then said Aaron unto Moses, Alas, my Lord, do not, I beseech thee, account to us as sin that wherein we have done foolishly, and wherein we have sinned. 
\v 12 Let her not be as a dead-born child, of which half the flesh is consumed, when it cometh out of its mother's womb. 
\v 13 And Moses cried unto the Lord, saying, O God! do thou heal her, I beseech thee. 
\v 14 And the Lord said unto Moses, If her father had spit in her face, would she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut up seven days outside of the camp, and after that let her be brought in again. 
\v 15 And Miriam was shut up outside of the camp seven days; and the people did not set forward till Miriam was brought in again. 
\v 16 And afterward the people removed from Chazeroth, and encamped in the wilderness of Paran. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Send thou out some men that they may spy out the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel: one man each of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send, every one who is a prince among them. 
\v 3 And Moses sent them out from the wilderness of Paran by the order of the Lord: they all were men, [who] were heads of the children of Israel. 
\v 4 And these are their names: Of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur. 
\v 5 Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Chori. 
\v 6 Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Yephunneh. 
\v 7 Of the tribe of Issachar, Yigal the son of Joseph. 
\v 8 Of the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea, the son of Nun. 
\v 9 Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu. 
\v 10 Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi. 
\v 11 Of the tribe of Joseph, of the tribe of Menasseh, Gaddi the son of Sussi. 
\v 12 Of the tribe of Dan, 'Ammiel the son of Gemalli. 
\v 13 Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael. 
\v 14 Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nachbi the son of Vophsi. 
\v 15 Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi. 
\v 16 These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land; and Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun, Joshua [[Yehoshua']]. 
\v 17 And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and he said unto them, Go you up this way at the south side, and go up into the mountain; 
\v 18 And see the land, what it is; and the people that dwell therein, whether they be strong or weak, whether they be few or many; 
\v 19 And what the land is on which they dwell, whether it be good or bad; and what the cities are in which they dwell, whether in open places, or in strongholds; 
\v 20 And what the land is, whether it be fat or lean, whether there be trees therein, or not; and take ye courage, and take away some of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the season of the first ripening of grapes. 
\v 21 And they went up, and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rechob, on the road to Chamath. 
\v 22 And they ascended on the south side, and came unto Hebron; and there were Achiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of 'Anak; [now Hebron had been built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.] 
\v 23 And they came unto the valley of Eshcol, and they cut down from there a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bore it upon a barrow between two; and [they took some] of the pomegranates and of the figs. 
\v 24 That place was called the valley of Eshcol, on account of the cluster which the children of Israel cut down from there. 
\v 25 And they returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days. 
\v 26 And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and they brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land. 
\v 27 And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou didst send us, and truly doth it flow with milk and honey; and this is its fruit. 
\v 28 Nevertheless the people are strong that dwell in the land, and the cities are very strongly walled, and great; and the children of 'Anak also have we seen there. 
\v 29 The Amalekites dwell in the southern country; and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Emorites, dwell in the mountains; and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the margin of the Jordan. 
\v 30 And Caleb stilled the people toward Moses, and he said, We can easily go up, and take possession of it; for we are well able to overcome it. 
\v 31 But the men who had gone up with him said, We are not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we. 
\v 32 And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had spied out unto the children of Israel, saying, The land through which we have passed to spy it out, is a land that consumeth its inhabitants; and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great stature. 
\v 33 And there we saw the giants, the sons of 'Anak, of the giants' [family]: and we were in our own eyes as grasshoppers, and so were we in their eyes. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1 And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried aloud; and the people wept that night. 
\v 2 And all the people murmured against Moses and against Aaron; and the whole congregation said unto them, Oh who would grant that we had died in the land of Egypt! or that we might but die in this wilderness! 
\v 3 And wherefore doth the Lord bring us unto yonder land, to fall by the sword? that our wives and our children may become a prey? is it not better for us to return to Egypt? 
\v 4 And they said one to another, Let us appoint a chief, and let us return to Egypt. 
\v 5 Then fell Moses and Aaron on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel. 
\v 6 And Joshua, the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Yephunneh, of those that had spied out the land, rent their garments. 
\v 7 And they said unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, as followeth, The land, through which we have passed to spy it out, this land is exceedingly good. 
\v 8 If the Lord have delight in us, then will he bring us into this land, and give it to us: a land which is flowing with milk and honey. 
\v 9 Only against the Lord do ye not rebel; and then ye need not fear the people of the land; for they are our bread: their shadow is departed from them, while the Lord is with us; fear them not. 
\v 10 But all the congregation said to stone them with stones: when the glory of the Lord appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation unto all the children of Israel. 
\v 11 And the Lord said unto Moses, How long yet shall this people provoke me? and how long yet will they not believe in me, with all the signs which I have shown in the midst of them? 
\v 12 I will smite them with the pestilence, and root them out, and I will make of thee a nation greater and mightier than they. 
\v 13 And Moses said unto the Lord, But when the Egyptian hear, from the midst of whom thou hast brought up in thy might this people;— 
\v 14 And when they tell to the inhabitants of this land, who have heard that thou, Lord, art in the midst of this people, that face to face thou, Lord, art seen, and that thy cloud standeth over them, and that in a pillar of cloud thou goest before them by day, and in a pillar of fire by night;— 
\v 15 That thou hast killed this people as one man: then will the nations that have heard thy fame, say in this manner, 
\v 16 That because the Lord was not able to bring this people into the land which he had sworn unto them, hath he slain them in the wilderness. 
\v 17 And now, I beseech thee, let the greatness of the power of the Lord be made manifest, as thou hast spoken, saying, 
\v 18 The Eternal is long-suffering, and abundant in beneficence, forgiving iniquity and transgression; but who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, upon the third and upon the fourth generation. 
\v 19 Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people, according to the greatness of thy beneficence, and as thou hast been indulgent to this people, from Egypt even until hitherto. 
\v 20 And the Lord said, I have pardoned according to thy word. 
\v 21 But as truly as I live, and as all the earth is filled with the glory of the Lord:— 
\v 22 That all the men who have seen my glory, and my signs, which I have displayed in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice, 
\v 23 Shall surely not see the land which I have sworn unto their fathers, yea all those that have provoked me shall not see it. 
\v 24 But my servant Caleb, as a reward that he had another spirit with him, and followed me fully,—therefore will I bring him into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it. 
\v 25 And the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwell in the valley: tomorrow turn you, and set forward into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea. 
\v 26 And the Lord spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 
\v 27 How long [shall indulgence be given] to this evil congregation, that murmur against me? the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me, have I heard. 
\v 28 Say unto them, As truly as I live, saith the Lord, as ye have spoken in my ears, so will I do to you: 
\v 29 In this wilderness shall your carcasses fall, and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward; ye who have murmured against me; 
\v 30 Truly ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I have lifted up my hand to let you dwell therein; save Caleb the son of Yephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun. 
\v 31 But your little ones of which ye said, They would become a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised. 
\v 32 But as for you, your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness. 
\v 33 And your children shall wander about in the wilderness forty years, and bear your backslidings, until your carcasses be spent in the wilderness. 
\v 34 After the number of the days in which ye spied out the land, forty days, yea, each one day for a year, shall ye bear for your iniquities, forty years; and ye shall experience my withdrawal [of protection]. 
\v 35 I the Lord have spoken it, surely, this will I do unto all this evil congregation that have assembled against me: in this wilderness shall they be spent, and therein shall they die. 
\v 36 And the men whom Moses had sent to spy out the land, and who returned, and caused all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up an evil report against the land, 
\v 37 Even these men, that had brought up the evil report of the land, died by the plague before the Lord. 
\v 38 But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Yephunneh, remained alive of those men, who had gone to spy out the land. 
\v 39 And Moses spoke these words unto all the children of Israel; and the people mourned greatly. 
\v 40 And they rose up early in the morning, and went up to the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, here we are, and we will go up unto the place of which the Lord hath spoken; for we have sinned. 
\v 41 And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the order of the Lord? and it will not prosper. 
\v 42 Do not go up, for the Lord is not among you; that ye may not be smitten before your enemies. 
\v 43 For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and ye will fall by the sword; since, because ye are turned away from the Lord, the Lord also will not be with you. 
\v 44 Yet they persisted to go up unto the top of the mountain; but the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and Moses, did not move out of the camp. 
\v 45 Then came down the Amalekites, and the Canaanites that dwelt on that mountain, and smote them, and discomfited them, even unto Chormah. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them, When ye shall have come into the land of your habitations, which I give unto you, 
\v 3 And ye will prepare a fire-offering unto the Lord, a burnt-offering, or a sacrifice, in performing a pronounced vow, or as a freewill-offering, or on your solemn feasts, to prepare a sweet savor unto the Lord, of the herds of the flocks: 
\v 4 Then shall he that bringeth his offering unto the Lord, bring as a meat-offering a tenth part of fine flour mingled with the fourth of a hin of oil. 
\v 5 And wine for a drink-offering, the fourth of a hin, shalt thou prepare with the burnt-offering or sacrifice, for each one sheep. 
\v 6 But for a ram, shalt thou prepare as a meat-offering two tenth parts of fine flour mingled with the third of a hin of oil. 
\v 7 And wine for the drink-offering, the third of a hin, shalt thou bring, for a sweet savor unto the Lord. 
\v 8 And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt-offering, or for a sacrifice, in performing a pronounced vow, or a peace-offering unto the Lord: 
\v 9 Then shall he bring with the bullock as a meat-offering, three tenth parts of fine flour mingled with half a hin of oil. 
\v 10 And wine shalt thou bring for a drink-offering, half a hin, as a fire-offering of a sweet savor unto the Lord. 
\v 11 Thus shall it be done for each one bullock, or for each one ram, or for a lamb, be it of the sheep or of the goats. 
\v 12 According to the number that ye may prepare, so shall ye do to every one according to their number. 
\v 13 All that are born in the country shall do these things after this manner, in offering a fire-offering of a sweet savor unto the Lord. 
\v 14 And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever may be among you in your generations, and will make an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto the Lord: as ye do, so shall he do. 
\v 15 Congregation! one statute shall be for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth: a statute for ever in your generations; as ye are, so shall the stranger be before the Lord. 
\v 16 One law and one code shall be for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you. 
\v 17 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 18 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land whither I bring you: 
\v 19 Then shall it be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye shall set aside a heave-offering unto the Lord. 
\v 20 As the first of your doughs shall ye set aside a cake for a heave-offering; like the heave-offering of the threshing-floor, so shall ye set this aside. 
\v 21 Of the first of your doughs shall ye give unto the Lord a heave-offering, in your generations. 
\v 22 And if ye err, and do not observe all these commandments, which the Lord hath spoken unto Moses, 
\v 23 All that the Lord hath commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the Lord commanded [the same] and thenceforward, among your generations: 
\v 24 Then shall it be, if, through inadvertence of the congregation, it was committed by ignorance, that all the congregation shall prepare one young bullock for a burnt-offering, for a sweet savor unto the Lord, with his meat-offering, and his drink-offering, according to the prescribed manner, and one he-goat for a sin-offering. 
\v 25 And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven unto them; for it is [a sin of] ignorance; and they have brought their offering, a sacrifice made by fire unto the Lord, and their sin-offering before the Lord, for their [sin of] ignorance: 
\v 26 And it shall be forgiven unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them; for by all the people [was it done] in ignorance. 
\v 27 And if any person sin through ignorance, then shall he bring a she-goat of the first year for a sin-offering. 
\v 28 And the priest shall make an atonement for the person that hath erred, in his sinning through ignorance before the Lord; to make an atonement for him, that it may be forgiven unto him. 
\v 29 For the native born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them:—one law shall be for you, for him that acteth through ignorance. 
\v 30 But the person that doth aught with a high hand, be he one born in the land, or a stranger, the same dishonoreth the Lord; and that person shall be cut off from among his people. 
\v 31 Because the word of the Lord hath he despised, and his commandment hath he broken; that person shall be cut off, his iniquity is upon him. 
\v 32 And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks upon the sabbath-day. 
\v 33 And they that found him gathering sticks brought him for judgment unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation. 
\v 34 And they put him in ward; because it had not been declared what should be done to him. 
\v 35 And the Lord said unto Moses, The man shall be put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp. 
\v 36 And all the congregation brought him forth to without the camp, and they stoned him with stones, and he died; as the Lord had commanded Moses. 
\v 37 And the Lord said unto Moses, as followeth, 
\v 38 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say to them, that they shall make themselves fringes on the corners of their garments throughout their generations, and that they shall put upon the fringe of the corner a thread of blue: 
\v 39 And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the Lord, and do them; and that ye seek not after [the inclination of] your own heart and [the delight of] your eyes, in pursuit of which ye have been led astray. 
\v 40 In order that ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God. 
\v 41 I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the Lord your God. 
\c 16  
\p
\v 1 Now Korach, the son of Yizhar, the son of Kehath, the son of Levi, was presumptuous, together with Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben: 
\v 2 So that they rose up before Moses, with certain men of the children of Israel, in number two hundred and fifty; [who were] princes of the congregation, called to the assembly, men of renown. 
\v 3 And they assembled themselves against Moses, and against Aaron, and said unto them, Ye assume too much; for the whole of the congregation are all of them holy, and the Lord is among them; wherefore then will you lift yourselves up above the congregation of the Lord? 
\v 4 And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face: 
\v 5 And he spoke unto Korach and unto all his company, saying, Tomorrow,—then will the Lord make known who is his, and who is holy, that he may cause them to come near unto him; and him whom he shall choose will he cause to come near unto him. 
\v 6 This do ye: Take yourselves censers, Korach and all his company; 
\v 7 And put therein fire, and put upon them incense before the Lord, tomorrow; and it shall be that the man whom the Lord will choose, he shall be the holy one; you assume too much, ye sons of Levi. 
\v 8 And Moses said unto Korach, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi: 
\v 9 It is too little for you, that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near unto himself, to do the service of the tabernacle of the Lord, and to stand before the congregation to minister for them? 
\v 10 And he hath brought thee near, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee: and now will ye seek the priesthood also? 
\v 11 For which cause [beware], thou and all thy company that are gathered together against the Lord; for Aaron, what is he, that ye should murmur against him: 
\v 12 And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab; but they said, We will not come up: 
\v 13 Is it too little that thou hast brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, that thou wilt assume to make thyself also a prince over us? 
\v 14 Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, and thou hast not given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou bore out the eyes of these men? we will not come up. 
\v 15 And this displeased Moses greatly, and he said unto the Lord, Have no respect unto their offering: I have not taken away an ass of any one of them, nor have I done wrong to any one of them. 
\v 16 And Moses said unto Korach, Thou and all thy company, be ye before the Lord, thou, and they, and Aaron, tomorrow: 
\v 17 And take ye every man his censer, and put incense upon them, and bring ye near before the Lord every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also, and Aaron, each his censer. 
\v 18 And they took every man his censer, and put fire on them, and laid incense thereupon; and they stood at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moses and Aaron.— 
\v 19 And Korach assembled against them all the congregation unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation; and the glory of the Lord then appeared unto all the congregation. 
\v 20 And the Lord spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 
\v 21 Separate yourselves from the midst of this congregation, and I will make an end of them in a moment. 
\v 22 And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, this one man doth sin, and with all the congregation wouldst thou be wroth! 
\v 23 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 24 Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you away from about the dwelling of Korach, Dathan, and Abiram. 
\v 25 And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and there went after him the elders of Israel. 
\v 26 And he spoke unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing which belongeth to them, lest ye be destroyed through all their sins. 
\v 27 So they got away from the dwelling of Korach, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, standing [boldly] at the door of their tents, with their wives, and their sons, and their little ones. 
\v 28 And Moses said, Through this shall ye know that the Lord hath sent me to do all these deeds; that [I have] not done them out of my own heart. 
\v 29 If these men die as all men die, and if the visitation of all men be visited on them: then hath the Lord not sent me. 
\v 30 But if the Lord do create a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertaineth unto them, and they go down alive into the pit: then shall ye understand that these men have provoked the Lord. 
\v 31 And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground that was under them was cloven asunder: 
\v 32 And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained unto Korach, and all their goods. 
\v 33 And they went down, they, and all they that appertained to them, alive into the pit; and the earth closed over them, and they disappeared from the midst of the congregation. 
\v 34 And all Israel that were round about them fled at their cry; for they said, Perhaps the earth may swallow us up [also]. 
\v 35 And there came out a fire from the Lord, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that had offered the incense. 
\v 36 (17:1) And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 37 (17:2) Speak unto Elazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he lift up the censers out of the burning, and throw out the fire far away; for they have been hallowed: 
\v 38 (17:3) The censers of these sinners against their own lives; and they shall make of them broad plates for a covering for the altar; for they brought them near before the Lord, and they have thus become hallowed; and they shall serve for a sign unto the children of Israel. 
\v 39 (17:4) And Elazar the priest took the copper censers, which they that were burnt had brought near; and they beat them out for a covering unto the altar: 
\v 40 (17:5) As a memorial unto the children of Israel, in order that no stranger, who is not of the seed of Aaron, should come near to burn incense before the Lord; that he become not as Korach, and as his company; as the Lord had spoken to him by the hand of Moses. 
\v 41 (17:6) And all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron, on the morrow, saying, It is you who have caused the people of the Lord to die. 
\v 42 (17:7) And it came to pass, when the congregation assembled against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation, and, behold, the cloud covered it; and the glory of the Lord appeared. 
\v 43 (17:8) And Moses came with Aaron before the tabernacle of the congregation. 
\v 44 (17:9) And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 45 (17:10) Remove yourselves from the midst of this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment. And they fell upon their faces. 
\v 46 (17:11) And Moses said unto Aaron, Take the censer, and put therein fire from off the altar, and put on incense, and carry [it] quickly unto the congregation, and make an atonement for them; for the wrath is gone forth from the Lord; the plague hath begun. 
\v 47 (17:12) And Aaron took as Moses had commanded, and he ran into the midst of the assembly; and, behold, the plague had begun among the people: and he put on the incense, and made an atonement for the people. 
\v 48 (17:13) And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed. 
\v 49 (17:14) And those who died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides those that had died about the matter of Korach. 
\v 50 (17:15) And Aaron returned unto Moses, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, after the plague had been stayed. 
\c 17  
\p
\v 1 (17:16) And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 (17:17) Speak unto the children of Israel, and take from them one staff each for a family division, from all their princes, according to their family divisions, twelve staves: the name of each man shalt thou write upon his staff. 
\v 3 (17:18) And the name of Aaron shalt thou write upon the staff of Levi; for there shall be but one staff for the head of their family division. 
\v 4 (17:19) And thou shalt lay them down in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony, where I usually meet with you. 
\v 5 (17:20) And it shall come to pass, that the staff of the man whom I shall choose, shall blossom: and I will allay from around me the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against you. 
\v 6 (17:21) And Moses spoke unto the children of Israel, and all their princes gave him each a staff, one for every prince, according to their family divisions, twelve staves: and the staff of Aaron was among their staves. 
\v 7 (17:22) And Moses laid down the staves before the Lord in the tabernacle of the testimony. 
\v 8 (17:23) And it came to pass on the morrow, that as Moses went into the tabernacle of the testimony, behold, the staff of Aaron for the house of Levi had budded; and it brought forth buds, and produced blossoms, and yielded ripe almonds. 
\v 9 (17:24) And Moses brought out all the staves from before the Lord unto all the children of Israel; and they looked [at them], and took away every one his staff. 
\v 10 (17:25) And the Lord said unto Moses, Carry back the staff of Aaron before the testimony, to be kept as a token against the children of rebellion, that there may be an end of their murmurings from around me, and they die not. 
\v 11 (17:26) And Moses did so; as the Lord had commanded him, so did he. 
\v 12 (17:27) And the children of Israel said unto Moses, thus, Behold, we perish, we are lost, we are all lost. 
\v 13 (17:28) Every one that cometh near at all unto the tabernacle of the Lord must die: shall we totally perish? 
\c 18  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord said unto Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy father's house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary; and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood. 
\v 2 And also thy brethren, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou near with thee, that they may be joined with thee, and minister unto thee; while thou and thy sons with thee shall be before the tabernacle of the testimony. 
\v 3 And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the tabernacle: only unto the vessels of the sanctuary and unto the altar shall they not come near, that they may not die, either they or you. 
\v 4 And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, respecting all the service of the tabernacle: and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you. 
\v 5 And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar; that there be not any more wrath upon the children of Israel. 
\v 6 And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from the midst of the children of Israel; unto you are they given as a gift for the Lord, to perform the service of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
\v 7 And thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priesthood concerning every matter of the altar, and for that within the vail, where ye shall serve: as a service of gift do I give you your priesthood; and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death. 
\v 8 And the Lord spoke unto Aaron, And I, behold, I give thee the charge of my heave-offerings; of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel, unto thee have I given them as an official portion, and to thy sons, as a fixed right for ever. 
\v 9 This shall belong to thee of the most holy things, from the fire-[offerings]: every oblation of theirs, namely, every meat-offering of theirs, and every sin-offering of theirs, and every, trespass-offering of theirs, which they shall render unto me, shall, as most holy things, belong to thee and to thy sons. 
\v 10 In a most holy place shalt thou eat it: every male shall eat it; holy shall it be unto thee. 
\v 11 And this shall be thine, as the heave-offering of their gift, of all the wave-offerings of the children of Israel; unto thee have I given them, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, as a fixed portion for ever: every one that is clean in thy house may eat thereof. 
\v 12 All the best of oil, and all the best of wine, and of corn, the first-fruits thereof which they shall offer unto the Lord, to thee have I given them. 
\v 13 The first ripe fruit of whatsoever is in their land, which they may bring unto the Lord, shall be thine: every one that is clean in thy house may eat thereof. 
\v 14 Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine. 
\v 15 Whatever openeth the womb of all flesh, which they bring unto the Lord, be it of men or of cattle, shall be thine: nevertheless thou shalt redeem the first-born of man, and the firstling of the unclean cattle shalt thou redeem. 
\v 16 And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem, according to the usual estimation of five shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs. 
\v 17 But the firstling of an ox, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: their blood shalt thou sprinkle upon the altar, and their fat shalt thou burn as a fire-offering, for a sweet savor unto the Lord. 
\v 18 And their flesh shall be thine: as the breast that is waved and as the right shoulder shall it be thine. 
\v 19 All the heave-offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel set apart unto the Lord, I have given to thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, as a fixed portion for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before the Lord for thee and for thy seed with thee. 
\v 20 And the Lord said unto Aaron, In their land shalt thou have no inheritance, and any portion shalt thou not have among them: I am thy portion and thy inheritance among the children of Israel. 
\v 21 And to the children of Levi, behold, I have given every tithe in Israel, for an inheritance, in lieu of their service which they render, the service of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
\v 22 And the children of Israel shall not henceforth come nigh unto the tabernacle of the congregation, to bear sin, to die thereby. 
\v 23 But they of the tribe of Levi themselves shall perform the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: a statute for ever shall it be throughout your generations; and among the children of Israel shall they not possess any inheritance. 
\v 24 But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as a heave-offering unto the Lord, have I given to the Levites for an inheritance: therefore have I said unto them, Among the children of Israel shall they obtain no inheritance. 
\v 25 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 26 And unto the Levites shalt thou speak, and say unto them, When ye take from the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance: then shall ye separate therefrom a heave-offering of the Lord, the tenth part of the tithe. 
\v 27 And your heave-offering shall be reckoned unto you, like the corn of the threshing-floor, and as the fulness of the wine-press. 
\v 28 Thus shall ye also offer a heave-offering unto the Lord from all your tithes, which ye may receive from the children of Israel; and ye shall give thereof the heave-offering of the Lord to Aaron the priest. 
\v 29 From all your gifts shall ye set apart every heave-offering of the Lord, from every best part thereof, its hallowed portion therefrom. 
\v 30 And thou shalt say unto them, When ye have separated the best thereof from it: then shall [the remainder] be counted unto the Levites as the produce of the threshing-floor, and as the produce of the wine-press. 
\v 31 And ye may eat it in every place, ye and your households; for it is your reward in lieu of your service at the tabernacle of the congregation. 
\v 32 And ye shall not bear any sin by reason of it, when ye have separated its best part from it: and the holy things of the children of Israel shall ye not profane, lest ye die. 
\c 19  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 
\v 2 This is the statute of the law which the Lord hath commanded, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee a completely red cow, on which there is no blemish, upon which no yoke hath ever come. 
\v 3 And ye shall give her unto Elazar the priest, and he shall lead her forth to without the camp, and some one shall slay her before his face: 
\v 4 And Elazar the priest shall take some of her blood with his finger; and he shall sprinkle in the direction of the front of the tabernacle of the congregation of her blood seven times. 
\v 5 And some one shall burn the cow before his eyes; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn. 
\v 6 And the priest shall take cedar-wood, and hyssop, and a scarlet string, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the cow. 
\v 7 And the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward may he come into the camp; and the priest shall be unclean until the evening. 
\v 8 And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water; and he shall be unclean until the evening. 
\v 9 And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the cow, and lay them up without the camp in a clean place; and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of sprinkling: it is a purification-offering. 
\v 10 And he that gathereth up the ashes of the cow shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening: and it shall be unto the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them, for a statute for ever. 
\v 11 He that toucheth the dead body of any human person shall be unclean seven days. 
\v 12 Such a one shall purify himself with it on the third day and on the seventh day, when he shall be clean; but if he purify himself not on the third day and on the seventh day, he shall not be clean. 
\v 13 Whosoever toucheth the dead body, the person of any man that is dead, and purifieth himself not, hath defiled the tabernacle of the Lord; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel; because the water of sprinkling was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet upon him. 
\v 14 This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent: Every one that cometh into the tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days. 
\v 15 And every open vessel, on which there is not a closely fitting cover, is unclean. 
\v 16 And whosoever toucheth in the open field one that hath been slain with a sword, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days. 
\v 17 And they shall take for the unclean person some of the ashes of the burnt purification-offering, and they shall put thereupon running water in a vessel. 
\v 18 And a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the persons that have been there, and upon him that hath touched the bone, or the one slain, or the dead, or the grave: 
\v 19 And the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day; and when he hath purified him on the seventh day, then shall he wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at evening. 
\v 20 But a man that is unclean, and doth not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation; because the sanctuary of the Lord hath he defiled; the water of sprinkling hath not been sprinkled upon him; he is unclean. 
\v 21 And it shall be unto them for a perpetual statute; and he that sprinkleth the water of sprinkling shall wash his clothes; and he that toucheth the water of sprinkling shall be unclean until the evening. 
\v 22 And whatsoever the unclean person may touch shall be unclean; and the person that toucheth him shall be unclean until the evening. 
\c 20  
\p
\v 1 And the children of Israel, the whole congregation, came into the desert of Zin in the first month, and the people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there. 
\v 2 And there was no water for the congregation; and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron. 
\v 3 And the people quarreled with Moses, and said thus, Oh that we had but perished when our brethren perished before the Lord! 
\v 4 And why have ye brought the congregation of the Lord into this wilderness, to die there, we and our cattle! 
\v 5 And wherefore have ye caused us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place? it is no place for sowing, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; and water even there is none to drink. 
\v 6 And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their faces: and the glory of the Lord appeared unto them. 
\v 7 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 8 Take the staff, and gather the assembly together, thou, with Aaron thy brother, and ye shall speak unto the rock before their eyes, that it shall give forth its water; and thou shalt bring forth for them water out of the rock, and give drink to the congregation and their cattle. 
\v 9 And Moses took the staff from before the Lord, as he had commanded him. 
\v 10 And Moses and Aaron assembled the congregation together before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels! shall we out of this rock bring forth water for you? 
\v 11 And Moses lifted up his hand, and he smote the rock with his staff twice: and there came out much water, and the congregation drank, together with their cattle. 
\v 12 And the Lord said unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye have not confided in me, to sanctify me before the eyes of the children of Israel: therefore shall ye not bring this congregation into the land which I have given to them. 
\v 13 These are the waters of Meribah; where the children of Israel quarreled with the Lord, and through which he was sanctified. 
\v 14 And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, Thus hath said thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the hardship that hath befallen us. 
\v 15 How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we dwelt in Egypt many days; and the Egyptians did evil to us, and to our fathers: 
\v 16 And we cried unto the Lord, and he heard our voice, and he sent a messenger, and caused us to go forth out of Egypt; and, behold, we are in Kadesh, a city at the outmost end of thy border. 
\v 17 Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy country; we will not pass through field, or through vineyard, and we will not drink the water of the wells: by the king's highway will we go, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy border. 
\v 18 And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass through my land, lest I come against thee with the sword. 
\v 19 And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the highway: and if we drink of thy water, I and my cattle, then will I pay its value; I will do thee no injury, only on foot will I pass through. 
\v 20 And he said, Thou shalt not pass through; and Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand. 
\v 21 And as Edom thus refused to permit Israel to pass through his border, Israel turned away from him. 
\v 22 And they set forward from Kadesh; and the children of Israel, the whole congregation, came unto mount Hor. 
\v 23 And the Lord said unto Moses and Aaron at mount Hor, by the boundary of the land of Edom, as followeth, 
\v 24 Aaron shall be gathered unto his people; for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my order at the waters of Meribah. 
\v 25 Take Aaron and Elazar, his son, and cause them to go up unto mount Hor: 
\v 26 And cause Aaron to take off his garments, and clothe therewith Elazar his son; and Aaron shall be gathered in, and he shall die there. 
\v 27 And Moses did as the Lord had commanded; and they went up to mount Hor before the eyes of all the congregation. 
\v 28 And Moses caused Aaron to take off his garments, and he clothed therewith Elazar his son; and Aaron died there on the top of the mount; and Moses and Elazar then came down from the mount. 
\v 29 And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was departed, they wept for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel. 
\c 21  
\p
\v 1 And when the Canaanite, the king of 'Arad, who dwelt in the south, heard that Israel was coming by the way of the spies: he made an attack on Israel, and took from them some prisoners. 
\v 2 And Israel made a vow unto the Lord, and said, If thou wilt but deliver this people into my hand, then will I devote their cities. 
\v 3 And the Lord hearkened to the voice of Israel, and he delivered up the Canaanites; and they devoted them and their cities: and they called the name of the place Chormah. 
\v 4 And they set forward from mount Hor by the way to the Red Sea, to go round the land of Edom: and the spirit of the people became impatient because of the way. 
\v 5 And the people spoke against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, and there is no water; and our soul loatheth this miserable bread. 
\v 6 And the Lord let loose against the people poisonous serpents, and they bit the people; and there died much people of Israel. 
\v 7 And the people then came to Moses, and they said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the Lord, and against thee; pray unto the Lord, that he take away from us the serpents. And Moses prayed for the people. 
\v 8 And the Lord said unto Moses, Make thyself a serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that whoever is bitten shall look at it, and he shall live. 
\v 9 And Moses made a serpent of copper, and put it upon a pole; and it came to pass, that, when a serpent had bitten any man, and he looked up to the serpent of copper, he remained alive. 
\v 10 And the children of Israel set forward, and encamped in Oboth. 
\v 11 And they journeyed from Oboth, and encamped at 'Iye-ha'abarim, in the wilderness, which is before Moab, toward the rising of the sun. 
\v 12 From there they set forward and encamped in the valley of Zered. 
\v 13 From there they set forward, and encamped on the other side of Arnon, which is in the wilderness, and which cometh out of the boundary of the Emorites; for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and between the Emorites. 
\v 14 Therefore mention is made in the book of the wars of the Lord, of Vaheb in Supha, and of the brooks of Arnon, 
\v 15 And the descent of the brooks, that turneth toward Shebeth-'Ar, and leaneth upon the border of Moab; 
\v 16 And from there to the well; this is the well where the Lord said unto Moses, Assemble the people and I will give them water. 
\v 17 Then did Israel sing this song, Come up, O well; sing ye unto it: 
\v 18 Well, which the princes have dug, which the nobles of the people have hollowed out with the sceptre, with their staves;— and from the wilderness to Mattanah; 
\v 19 And from Mattanah to Nachaliel; and from Nachaliel to Bamoth; 
\v 20 And from Bamoth to the valley, which is in the fields of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward the desert. 
\v 21 And Israel sent messengers unto Sichon the king of the Emorites, saying, 
\v 22 Let me pass through thy land; we will not turn aside into field, or into vineyard; we will not drink the water of a well: by the king's highway will we go along, until we have passed thy border. 
\v 23 But Sichon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border; and Sichon assembled all his people together; and went out against Israel into the wilderness; and he came to Yahaz, and fought against Israel. 
\v 24 And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and took possession of his land from Arnon unto Yabbok, even unto the children of 'Ammon; for the border of the children of 'Ammon was strong. 
\v 25 And Israel took all these cities; and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Emorites, in Cheshbon, and in all the villages thereof. 
\v 26 For Cheshbon was the city of Sichon the king of the Emorites; and he had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, up to the Arnon. 
\v 27 Therefore said the poets, Come into Cheshbon, let the city of Sichon be built and established. 
\v 28 For a fire is gone out of Cheshbon, a flame from the city of Sichon: it hath consumed 'Ar-Moab, the men of the high places of the Arnon. 
\v 29 Woe to thee, Moab! thou art lost, O people of Kemosh: he hath suffered his sons to become fugitives, and his daughters to go into captivity, unto the king of the Emorites, Sichon. 
\v 30 We have thrown them down; lost is Cheshbon even unto Dibon, and we have laid waste [all] up to Nophach, which reacheth unto Medeba. 
\v 31 Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Emorites. 
\v 32 And Moses sent to spy out Ya'zer, and they captured the villages thereof, and drove out the Emorites that were there. 
\v 33 And they turned and went up by the way to Bashan; and 'Og, the king of Bashan, went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battle at Edrei. 
\v 34 And the Lord said unto Moses, Fear him not; for into thy hand have I delivered him, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do unto him as thou hast done unto Sichon, the king of the Emorites, who dwelt at Cheshbon. 
\v 35 And they smote him and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left unto him that escaped; and they took possession of his land. 
\c 22  
\p
\v 1 And the children of Israel set forward, and encamped in the plains of Moab, on this side of the Jordan, opposite Jericho. 
\v 2 And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Emorites. 
\v 3 And Moab was greatly afraid of the people, because it was numerous; and Moab was horrified because of the children of Israel. 
\v 4 And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now will this assemblage devour all that is round about us, as the ox devoureth the grass of the field; and Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time. 
\v 5 And he sent messengers unto Bil'am the son of Beor to Pethor, which is by the river, in the land of the children of his people, to have him called; saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt; behold, it covereth the surface of the earth, and it is abiding opposite to me: 
\v 6 And now do but come, curse me this people; for it is too mighty for me; peradventure I may be able to smite it, that I may drive it out of the land; for I know that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed. 
\v 7 And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Bil'am, and spoke unto him the words of Balak. 
\v 8 And he said unto them, Remain you here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the Lord may speak unto me; and the princes of Moab abode with Bil'am. 
\v 9 And God came unto Bil'am, and said, Who are these men with thee? 
\v 10 And Bil'am said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, the king of Moab, hath sent unto me, [saying,] 
\v 11 Behold, there is the people that is come out of Egypt, and covereth the face of the earth: now come, denounce it for me; peradventure I shall be able to fight against it, and drive it away. 
\v 12 And God said unto Bil'am, Thou shalt not go with them: thou shalt not curse the people; for it is blessed. 
\v 13 And Bil'am rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Go back to your land; for the Lord refuseth to give me leave to go with you. 
\v 14 And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Bil'am refuseth to come with us. 
\v 15 And Balak sent yet again princes, more in number, and more honorable than those. 
\v 16 And they came to Bil'am, and said to him, Thus hath said Balak the son of Zippor, Do not suffer thyself, I pray thee, to be prevented from coming unto me; 
\v 17 For I will honor thee greatly, and whatsoever thou mayest say unto me will I do: and only come, I pray thee, denounce me this people. 
\v 18 And Bil'am answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not transgress the order of the Lord my God, to do a small or a great thing. 
\v 19 And now, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the Lord will farther speak with me. 
\v 20 And God came unto Bil'am at night, and said unto him, If to call thee the men have come, rise up, go with them; but only the word which I shall speak unto thee, that shalt thou do. 
\v 21 And Bil'am rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab. 
\v 22 And the anger of God was kindled, because he went; and an angel of the Lord placed himself in the way to be a hindrance to him; and he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him. 
\v 23 And the ass saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Bil'am smote the ass, to make her turn into the way. 
\v 24 But the angel of the Lord stepped into a path between the vineyards, [with] a wall on this side, and a wall on that side. 
\v 25 And when the ass saw the angel of the Lord, she forced herself against the wall, and pressed Bil'am's foot against the wall: and he smote her again. 
\v 26 And the angel of the Lord went yet farther, and stood in a narrow place, where there was no way to turn either to the right or to the left. 
\v 27 And when the ass saw the angel of the Lord, she lay down under Bil'am: whereupon Bil'am's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a stick. 
\v 28 And the Lord opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Bil'am, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times? 
\v 29 And Bil'am said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: had I but a sword in my hand, I would assuredly have now killed thee. 
\v 30 And the ass said unto Bil'am, Am not I thy ass, upon which thou hast ridden from thy commencement unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? and he said, No. 
\v 31 Then the Lord opened the eyes of Bil'am, and he saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head and prostrated himself on his face. 
\v 32 And the angel of the Lord said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thy ass these three times? behold, I went out to be a hindrance; because the journey which is odious to me was too quickly begun. 
\v 33 And the ass saw me, and turned aside before me these three times; if she had not turned aside from me, I would surely now not only have slain thee, but saved her alive. 
\v 34 And Bil'am said unto the angel of the Lord, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou wast standing against me in the way; but now, if it be evil in thy eyes, I will return home again. 
\v 35 And the angel of the Lord said unto Bil'am, Go with the men; however, only the word which I will speak unto thee, that shalt thou speak: and Bil'am went with the princes of Balak. 
\v 36 And when Balak heard that Bil'am was come, he went out to meet him unto 'Ir-Moab, which is on the border of Arnon, which is at the outmost end of the boundary. 
\v 37 And Balak said unto Bil'am, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to have thee called? wherefore camest thou not unto me? in truth, am I not able to honor thee? 
\v 38 And Bil'am said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee; have I now any power whatever to speak the least? the word that God may put in my mouth, that alone must I speak. 
\v 39 And Bil'am went with Balak, and they came unto Kiryath-chuzoth. 
\v 40 And Balak slew oxen and sheep, and sent to Bil'am and to the princes that were with him. 
\v 41 And it came to pass in the morning, that Balak took Bil'am, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, and he saw thence a portion of the people. 
\c 23  
\p
\v 1 And Bil'am said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams. 
\v 2 And Balak did as Bil'am had spoken; and Balak and Bil'am offered a bullock and a ram on every altar. 
\v 3 And Bil'am said unto Balak, Place thyself by thy burnt-offering; and I will go, peradventure the Lord will come to meet me, and whatsoever he may show me I will tell thee: and he went thoughtfully alone. 
\v 4 And God met Bil'am: and he said unto him, The seven altars have I made ready, and I have offered a bullock and a ram upon every altar. 
\v 5 And the Lord put a word in Bil'am's mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus shalt thou speak. 
\v 6 And he returned unto him, and, lo, he was standing by his burnt-offering, he, and all the princes of Moab. 
\v 7 And he took up his parable, and said, From Aram did Balak send for me, the king of Moab, out of the mountains of the east, Come, curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel. 
\v 8 How shall I denounce, whom God hath not denounced? and how shall I defy, whom the Lord hath not defied? 
\v 9 For from the top of rocks I see him, and from hills I behold him: lo, it is a people that shall dwell alone, and among the nations it shall not be reckoned. 
\v 10 Who can count the dust of Jacob, and number the fourth part of Israel? May my soul die the death of the righteous, and may my last end be like his! 
\v 11 And Balak said unto Bil'am, What hast thou done unto me? to denounce my enemies did I take thee, and, behold, thou hast even blessed them. 
\v 12 And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that only which the Lord may put in my mouth? 
\v 13 And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from where thou canst see them; nevertheless a portion of them only wilt thou see, but the whole of them thou wilt not see: and denounce them for me from there. 
\v 14 And he brought him to the field of the watchmen, on the top of Pisgah, and he built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar. 
\v 15 And he said unto Balak, Place thyself here by thy burnt-offering, while I will repair to yonder place. 
\v 16 And the Lord met Bil'am, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus shalt thou speak. 
\v 17 And he came to him, and, behold, he was standing by his burnt-offering, and the princes of Moab with him; and Balak said unto him: What hath the Lord spoken? 
\v 18 And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; bend hither thy ear unto me, son of Zippor! 
\v 19 God is not a man, that he should lie; nor a son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? and hath he spoken, and shall he not fulfill it? 
\v 20 Behold, to bless I have received [the word]; and he hath blessed, and I cannot reverse it. 
\v 21 He hath not beheld any wrong in Jacob, nor hath he seen perverseness in Israel: the Lord his God is with him, and the glory of the king dwelleth among him. 
\v 22 God, who brought them out of Egypt, is to them like the heights of the reem. 
\v 23 For there is no enchantment in Jacob, nor is there any divination in Israel: at the proper time shall it be said to Jacob and to Israel, what God doth work. 
\v 24 Behold, it is a people, that shall rise up as a lioness, and as a lion shall it raise itself: it will not lie down until it have eaten the prey, and have drunk the blood of the slain. 
\v 25 And Balak said unto Bil'am, Neither shalt thou denounce them, nor shalt thou any wise bless them. 
\v 26 But Bil'am answered and said unto Balak, Have I not spoken unto thee, saying, all that the Lord will speak, that must I do. 
\v 27 And Balak said unto Bil'am, Come, I pray thee, I will take thee unto another place, peradventure it may be pleasing in the eyes of God that thou mayest denounce them for me from there. 
\v 28 And Balak took Bil'am unto the top of Peor, that looketh toward the desert. 
\v 29 And Bil'am said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams. 
\v 30 And Balak did as Bil'am had said, and he offered a bullock and a ram on every altar. 
\c 24  
\p
\v 1 And when Bil'am saw that it was pleasing in the eyes of the Lord to bless Israel, he went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness. 
\v 2 And Bil'am lifted up his eyes, and when he saw Israel encamped according to their tribes, there came upon him the spirit of God. 
\v 3 And he took up his parable, and said, Thus saith Bil'am the son of Beor, and thus saith the man whose eyes are open; 
\v 4 Thus saith he who heareth the sayings of God, who seeth the vision of the Almighty, falling down, with unvailed eyes: 
\v 5 How beautiful are thy tents, O Jacob, thy dwelling, O Israel! 
\v 6 As streams are they spread forth, as gardens by the river's side, as aloe-trees, which the Lord hath planted, as cedar-trees beside the waters. 
\v 7 Water runneth out of His buckets, that his seed may be moistened by abundance of water; and exalted above Agag shall be his king, and raised on high shall be his kingdom. 
\v 8 God, who brought him forth out of Egypt, is to him like the heights of the reem; he will devour nations, his oppressors, and their bones will he break, and pierce [them] through with his arrows. 
\v 9 He coucheth, he lieth down as a lion, and as a lioness: who shall make him rise up? They that bless thee be blessed, and they that curse thee be cursed. 
\v 10 And the anger of Balak was kindled against Bil'am, and he struck his hands together: and Balak said unto Bil'am, To denounce my enemies did I call thee, and, behold, thou hast even blessed them these three times. 
\v 11 And now flee thou to thy place: I thought to honor thee greatly; but, lo, the Lord hath kept thee back from honor. 
\v 12 And Bil'am said unto Balak, Did I not already speak to thy messengers, whom thou sentest unto me, saying, 
\v 13 If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not transgress the order of the Lord, to do good or evil out of my own heart: what the Lord will speak, that must I speak? 
\v 14 And now, behold, I am going unto my people: come, I will advise thee against what this people will do to thy people in the end of days. 
\v 15 And he took up his parable and said, Thus saith Bil'am the son of Beor, and thus saith the man whose eyes are open; 
\v 16 Thus saith he who heareth the sayings of God, and knoweth the knowledge of the Most High, who seeth the vision of the Almighty, falling down, with unvailed eyes: 
\v 17 I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not nigh; there steppeth forth a star out of Jacob, and there ariseth a sceptre out of Israel, and he pierceth the chiefs of Moab, and destroyeth all the children of Sheth. 
\v 18 And Edom shall be a conquest, and Seir shall be a conquest for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly. 
\v 19 And there shall rule the one from Jacob, and he shall destroy whatever escapeth out of the city. 
\v 20 And he looked on Amalek, and he took up his parable, and said, The first of nations is Amalek; but his latter end shall be destruction for ever. 
\v 21 And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is thy dwelling-place, and placed on the rock is thy nest. 
\v 22 Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted: whither will Asshur carry thee away captive? 
\v 23 And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when God doth appoint this one? 
\v 24 But ships will come from the coast of Kittim, and will afflict Asshur, and will afflict 'Eber; and he also will be given to destruction for ever. 
\v 25 And Bil'am rose up, and went and returned to his place; and Balak also went his way. 
\c 25  
\p
\v 1 And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit incest with the daughters of Moab. 
\v 2 And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods: and the people did eat, and bowed themselves down to their gods. 
\v 3 And Israel joined themselves unto Baal-peor; and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel. 
\v 4 And the Lord said unto Moses, Take all the heads of the people, and [cause them to] hang the [guilty] up before the Lord, in the face of the sun, that the fierce anger of the Lord may be turned away from Israel. 
\v 5 And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his men that have been joined unto Baal-peor. 
\v 6 And, behold, one of the children of Israel came, and brought unto his brethren a Midianitish woman, before the eyes of Moses, and before the eyes of all the congregation of the children of Israel, and these were weeping by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
\v 7 And when Phinehas, the son of Elazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from the midst of the congregation, and took a javelin in his hand; 
\v 8 And he went after the man of Israel into the tent, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her body: and the plague was stayed from the children of Israel. 
\v 9 And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand. 
\v 10 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 11 Phinehas, the son of Elazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned away my wrath from the children of Israel, while he was zealous in my stead in the midst of them, that I consumed not the children of Israel in my indignation. 
\v 12 Therefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace; 
\v 13 And it shall be unto him and unto his seed after him a covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the children of Israel. 
\v 14 Now the name of the man of Israel that was slain, who was slain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Sahlu, a prince of a family division among the Simeonites. 
\v 15 And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was head of tribes, of a family division in Midian. 
\v 16 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 17 Attack the Midianites and smite them; 
\v 18 For they are enemies unto you with their wiles, wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister, who was slain on the day of the plague for the sake of Peor. 
\c 26  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass after the plague, That the Lord spoke unto Moses and unto Elazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying, 
\v 2 Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, by the descent from their fathers, all that are able to go forth to war in Israel. 
\v 3 And Moses with El'azar the priest spoke with them in the plains of Moab by the Jordan opposite Jericho, saying, 
\v 4 [Take the sum of the people,] from twenty years old and upward; as the Lord commanded Moses and the children of Israel, who went forth out of the land of Egypt. 
\v 5 Reuben, the eldest son of Israel: the children of Reuben, of Chanoch, the family of the Chanochites; of Pallu, the family of the Palluites; 
\v 6 Of Chezron, the family of the Chezronites; of Carmi, the family of the Carmites. 
\v 7 These are the families of the Reubenites; and those that were numbered of them were forty and three thousand and seven hundred and thirty. 
\v 8 And the sons of Pallu: Eliab. 
\v 9 And the sons of Eliab: Nemuel, and Dathan, and Abiram. These are Dathan and Abiram, men called to the assembly, who quarreled against Moses and against Aaron in the company of Korach, at the time they quarreled against the Lord; 
\v 10 When the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up together with Korach, while that company died, when the fire devoured the two hundred and fifty men; and they became a sign. 
\v 11 But the sons of Korach did not die. 
\v 12 The sons of Simeon after their families: of Nemuel, the family of the Nemuelites; of Yamin, the family of the Yaminites; of Yachin, the family of the Yachinites;

\v 41 These are the sons of Benjamin after their families; and those that were numbered of them were forty and five thousand and six hundred.

\v 51 These were the numbered of the children of Israel, six hundred thousand, and one thousand, seven hundred and thirty. 
\v 52 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 53 Unto these shall the land be divided for an inheritance according to the number of the names. 
\v 54 To the large tribe shalt thou give the more inheritance, and to the small shalt thou give the less inheritance: to each according to those that were numbered thereof shall its inheritance be given. 
\v 55 Nevertheless, through the lot shall the land be divided: according to the names of the tribes of their fathers shall they obtain their inheritance. 
\v 56 By the decision of the lot shall the inheritance of each be divided, according as they are many or few. 
\v 57 And these are those that were numbered of the Levites after their families: of Gershon, the family of the Gershunites: of Kehath, the family of the Kehathites; of Merari, the family of the Merarites. 
\v 58 These are the families of Levi: the family of the Libnites, the family of the Chebronites, the family of the Machlites, the family of the Mushites, the family of the Korchites; and Kehath begat 'Amran. 
\v 59 And the name of 'Amram's wife was Yochebed, the daughter of Levi, whom [her mother] bore to Levi in Egypt; and she bore unto Amram, Aaron and Moses, and Miriam their sister. 
\v 60 And there were born unto Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, Elazar, and Ithamar. 
\v 61 And Nadab and Abihu died, when they offered a strange fire before the Lord. 
\v 62 And those that were numbered of them were twenty and three thousand, all the males from a month old and upward; for they were not numbered among the children of Israel, because there was not given unto them any inheritance among the children of Israel. 
\v 63 These are those that were numbered by Moses and Elazar the priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan, opposite Jericho. 
\v 64 And among these there was not one man of those whom Moses and Aaron the priest had numbered, who numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai. 
\v 65 For the Lord had said of them, They shall surely die in the wilderness: and there was not left of them one man, save Caleb the son of Yephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun. 
\c 27  
\p
\v 1 And there came nigh the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Chepher, the son of Gil'ad, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Menasseh the son of Joseph: and these are the names of his daughters, Machlah, No'ah, and Choglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah. 
\v 2 And they stood before Moses, and before Elazar the priest, and before the princes, and all the congregation, by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying, 
\v 3 Our father died in the wilderness; but he was not among the company of those that gathered themselves together against the Lord in the company of Korach; but in his own sin he died, and sons he had not. 
\v 4 Why should the name of our father be done away from the midst of his family, because he hath no son? Give unto us a possession among the brothers of our father. 
\v 5 And Moses brought their cause before the Lord. 
\v 6 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 7 The daughters of Zelophehad speak rightly: thou shalt indeed give them a possession as an inheritance among the brothers of their father; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them. 
\v 8 And unto the children of Israel shalt thou speak, saying, If a man die, and have no son, then shall ye cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter. 
\v 9 And if he have no daughter, then shall ye give his inheritance unto his brothers. 
\v 10 And if he have no brothers, then shall ye give his inheritance unto his father's brothers. 
\v 11 And if his father have no brothers, then shall ye give his inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his family, and he shall inherit it; and it shall be unto the children of Israel a statute of justice, as the Lord hath commanded Moses. 
\v 12 And the Lord said unto Moses, Go thou up unto this mount of 'Abarim, and see the land which I have given unto the children of Israel. 
\v 13 And when thou hast seen it, then shalt thou also be gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother hath been gathered. 
\v 14 Because ye rebelled against my order in the desert of Zin, at the quarreling of the congregation, to sanctify me through the waters before their eyes: these are the waters of Meribah in Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin. 
\v 15 And Moses spoke unto the Lord, saying, 
\v 16 Let the Lord, the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the congregation, 
\v 17 Who may go out before them, and who may come in before them, and who may lead them out, and who may bring them in; that the congregation of the Lord be not as a flock which have no shepherd. 
\v 18 And the Lord said unto Moses, Take to thyself Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom there is a spirit, and thou shalt lay thy hand upon him; 
\v 19 And thou shalt cause him to stand before Elazar the priest, and before all the congregation; and thou shalt give him a charge before their eyes. 
\v 20 And thou shalt put some of thy greatness upon him; in order that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient. 
\v 21 And before Elazar the priest shall he stand, and he shall ask of him after the judgment of the Urim before the Lord: at his direction shall they go out, and at his direction shall they come in, he, and all the children of Israel with him, and all the congregation. 
\v 22 And Moses did, as the Lord had commanded him; and he took Joshua, and caused him to stand before Elazar the priest, and before all the congregation; 
\v 23 And he laid his hands upon him, and gave him a charge: as the Lord had commanded by the hand of Moses. 
\c 28  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, My offering, my bread for my sacrifices consumed by fire, for a sweet savor unto me, shall ye observe to offer unto me in its due season. 
\v 3 And thou shalt say unto them, This is the offering made by fire which ye shall bring unto the Lord: Sheep of the first year without blemish, two on every day, as a continual burnt-offering. 
\v 4 The one sheep shalt thou prepare in the morning, and the other sheep shalt thou prepare toward evening; 
\v 5 And a tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meat-offering, mingled with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil. 
\v 6 It is a continual burnt-offering, as it was prepared at mount Sinai, for a sweet savor, a sacrifice made by fire unto the Lord. 
\v 7 And the drink-offering thereof shall be the fourth part of a hin for the one sheep: in the holy place shalt thou cause the strong wine to be poured out as a drink-offering unto the Lord. 
\v 8 And the other sheep shalt thou prepare toward evening: as the meat-offering of the morning, and as the drink-offering thereof, shalt thou prepare it; an offering made by fire, for a sweet savor unto the Lord. 
\v 9 And on the sabbath-day two sheep of the first year without blemish, and two tenth parts of fine flour for a meat-offering, mingled with oil, and the drink-offering thereof. 
\v 10 This is the burnt-offering of the sabbath on every sabbath, besides the continual burnt-offering, and its drink-offering. 
\v 11 And on the beginnings of your months shall ye bring as a burnt-offering unto the Lord, two young bullocks, and one ram, seven sheep of the first year without blemish.

\v 40 (30:1) And Moses said to the children of Israel according to all that the Lord had commanded Moses. 
\c 30  
\p
\v 1 (30:2) And Moses spoke unto the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel, saving, This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded, 
\v 2 (30:3) If a man make a vow unto the Lord, or he swear an oath to bind his soul with an obligation: he shall not profane his word; according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth shall he do. 
\v 3 (30:4) And if a woman make a vow unto the Lord, and bind herself by an obligation, being in her father's house in her youth; 
\v 4 (30:5) And her father hear her vow, and her obligation wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father be silent to her: then shall all her vows stand, and every obligation wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand. 
\v 5 (30:6) But if her father disallow her on the day that he heareth it: all her vows or her obligations, wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall not stand; and the Lord will forgive her, because her father hath disallowed her. 
\v 6 (30:7) And if she be given to a man, and have vows upon her, or what she may have uttered with her lips, wherewith she hath bound her soul; 
\v 7 (30:8) And her husband hear it, and be silent to her on the day that he heareth it: then shall her vows stand, and her obligations wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand. 
\v 8 (30:9) But if on the day of her husband's hearing it, he disallow her: then doth he annul her vow which is upon her, and that which she hath uttered with her lips, wherewith she hath bound her soul; and the Lord will forgive her. 
\v 9 (30:10) But regarding the vow of a widow, or of her that is divorced, all, wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand for her. 
\v 10 (30:11) And if she had vowed in her husband's house, or had bound her soul by an obligation with an oath; 
\v 11 (30:12) And her husband heard it, and was silent to her, and disallowed her not: then all her vows shall stand, and every obligation, wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand. 
\v 12 (30:13) But if her husband hath annulled them on the day he heard them: then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips, concerning her vows, or concerning the obligation of her soul, shall not stand; her husband hath annulled them; and the Lord will forgive her. 
\v 13 (30:14) Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the person, her husband may confirm it, or her husband may annul it. 
\v 14 (30:15) But if her husband should be silent to her from day to day: then hath he confirmed all her vows, or all her obligations, which are upon her; he hath confirmed them, because he was silent to her on the day that he heard them. 
\v 15 (30:16) But if he should annul them after [the day] that he hath heard them: then shall he bear her iniquity. 
\v 16 (30:17) These are the statutes, which the Lord commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between the father and his daughter, being yet in her youth, in her father's house. 
\c 31  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Execute the vengeance of the children of Israel on the Midianites, after which thou shalt be gathered unto thy people. 
\v 3 And Moses spoke unto the people, saying, Arm from yourselves some men for the army, and let them go against the Midianites, to execute the vengeance of the Lord on Midian. 
\v 4 A thousand each for every tribe, of all the tribes of Israel, shall ye send to the army. 
\v 5 And there were levied out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for the army. 
\v 6 And Moses sent them, a thousand of every tribe, to the army; them and Phinehas the son of Elazar the priest, to the army, with the holy vessels, and the trumpets for blowing the alarm in his hand. 
\v 7 And they marched out against the Midianites, as the Lord had commanded Moses; and they slew every male. 
\v 8 And the kings of Midian they slew, besides the rest of their men that were slain; namely, Evi and Rekem, and Zur, and Chur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian; and Bil'am the son of Beor they slew with the sword. 
\v 9 And the children of Israel took captives the women of Midian, and their little ones; and all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods, they took as spoil. 
\v 10 And all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all their castles they burnt with fire. 
\v 11 And they took all the spoil, and all the booty, both of men and of cattle. 
\v 12 And they brought unto Moses, and to Elazar the priest, and unto the congregation of the children of Israel, the captives, and the booty, and the spoil, unto the camp, to the plains of Moab, which are by the Jordan opposite Jericho. 
\v 13 And Moses, and Elazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them, to without the camp. 
\v 14 And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, the captains over the thousands, and the captains over the hundreds, who had come from the war-campaign. 
\v 15 And Moses said unto them, Have ye allowed all the females to live? 
\v 16 Behold, these chiefly were the cause unto the children of Israel, through the counsel of Bil'am, to commit the gross trespass against the Lord in the matter of Peor; through which there was the plague among the congregation of the Lord. 
\v 17 And now kill ye every male among the little ones, and every woman that hath known man by lying with him shall ye kill. 
\v 18 But all among the women-children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves. 
\v 19 But ye,—you must abide without the camp seven days: all ye who have killed any person, and all who have touched any one slain, shall purify yourselves on the third day, and on the seventh day; both you and your captives. 
\v 20 And every garment, and whatever is made of skins, and every work of goats' hair, and every vessel made of wood, shall ye purify unto yourselves. 
\v 21 And Elazar the priest said unto the men of the army who had gone to the battle, This is the ordinance of the law which the Lord hath commanded Moses: 
\v 22 Nevertheless the gold, and the silver, the copper, the iron, the tin, and the lead, 
\v 23 Every thing that cometh into the fire shall ye make go through the fire, and it shall be clean; only it shall be purified with the waters of sprinkling: and whatsoever doth not come into the fire shall ye cause to go through the water. 
\v 24 And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall be clean, and after that may ye come into the camp. 
\v 25 And the Lord said unto Moses, as followeth, 
\v 26 Take the sum of the booty of the captives, both of man and of cattle, thou, with Elazar the priest, and the chiefs of the families of the congregation: 
\v 27 And thou shalt divide the booty, between those that carried on the war, who went out to the army, and between all the congregation. 
\v 28 And thou shalt levy a tribute unto the Lord from the men of war who went out to the army, one individual from every five hundred, of the persons, and of the beef-cattle, and of the asses, and of the sheep; 
\v 29 From their half shall ye take it; and thou shalt give it unto Elazar the priest, for a heave-offering of the Lord. 
\v 30 And from the half of the children of Israel, shalt thou take one individual, as it may come, from any fifty, of the persons, of beef-cattle, of the asses, and of the flocks, of all manner of cattle; and thou shalt give the same unto the Levites, who keep the charge of the tabernacle of the Lord. 
\v 31 And Moses with Elazar the priest did, as the Lord had commanded Moses. 
\v 32 And the booty, being the rest of the spoil which the men of the army had taken, was of sheep and goats, six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand, 
\v 33 And of beef-cattle, seventy and two thousand, 
\v 34 And of asses, sixty and one thousand, 
\v 35 And of human persons, of women that had not known men by lying with him, in all thirty and two thousand. 
\v 36 And the half, the portion of those who had gone out in the army, was, in the number of sheep and goats, three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred. 
\v 37 And the tribute unto the Lord of the flocks was six hundred and seventy and five. 
\v 38 And the beef-cattle were thirty and six thousand; and the tribute thereof unto the Lord was seventy and two. 
\v 39 And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; and the tribute thereof unto the Lord was sixty and one. 
\v 40 And the human persons were sixteen thousand; and the tribute thereof unto the Lord was thirty and two persons. 
\v 41 And Moses gave the tribute, the Lord's heave-offering, unto Elazar the priest, as the Lord had commanded Moses. 
\v 42 And from the half of the children of Israel, which Moses divided off from the men that had gone forth in the army,— 
\v 43 (Now the half of the congregation was, of sheep and goats three hundred thousand and thirty thousand, seven thousand and five hundred. 
\v 44 And beef-cattle, thirty and six thousand, 
\v 45 And asses thirty thousand five hundred, 
\v 46 And human persons sixteen thousand;) 
\v 47 And Moses took from this half of the children of Israel, as it came, one from every fifty, of man and of cattle, and gave the same unto the Levites, who kept the charge of the tabernacle of the Lord; as the Lord had commanded Moses. 
\v 48 And there came near unto Moses the officers who had been over the thousands of the army, the captains of the thousands, and the captains of the hundreds. 
\v 49 And they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war who have been under our command, and there lacketh not one man of us. 
\v 50 We have therefore brought an oblation unto the Lord, each what he hath gotten of vessels of gold, chains, and bracelets, finger-rings, earrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the Lord. 
\v 51 And Moses with Elazar the priest took the gold from them, all kinds of wrought articles. 
\v 52 And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the Lord, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels, from the captains of the thousands, and from the captains of the hundreds. 
\v 53 The men of the army had taken spoil, every man for himself. 
\v 54 And Moses and Elazar the priest took the gold from the captains of the thousands and of the hundreds, and they brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation, as a memorial for the children of Israel before the Lord. 
\c 32  
\p
\v 1 Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle; and they saw the land of Ya'zer, and the land of Gil'ad, that, behold, the place was a place for cattle. 
\v 2 And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben came, and said unto Moses, and unto Elazar the priest, and unto the princes of the congregation, as followeth, 
\v 3 'Ataroth, and Dibon, and Ya'zer, and Nimrah, and Cheshbon, and El'aleh, and Sebam, and Nebo, and Be'on, 
\v 4 The country which the Lord hath smitten before the congregation of Israel, is a land for cattle; and thy servants have cattle. 
\v 5 And they said, If we have found grace in thy eyes, let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession: do not compel us to go over the Jordan. 
\v 6 And Moses said unto the children of Gad, and unto the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to the war, and will ye sit here? 
\v 7 And wherefore will you turn aside the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the Lord hath given them? 
\v 8 Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea' to see the land. 
\v 9 For they went up as far as the valley of Eshcol, and they saw the land, and then they turned aside the heart of the children of Israel, so that they would not go into the land which the Lord had given them. 
\v 10 And the anger of the Lord was kindled on that day, and he swore, saying, 
\v 11 Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I swore unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me: 
\v 12 Save Caleb the son of Yephunneh the Kenizzite, and Joshua the son of Nun; for they have wholly followed the Lord. 
\v 13 And the anger of the Lord was thus kindled against Israel, and he made them wander about in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation was spent, that had done the evil in the eyes of the Lord. 
\v 14 And now, behold, ye are risen up in your father's stead, a new race of sinful men, to augment yet more the fierce anger of the Lord toward Israel. 
\v 15 For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet longer leave them in the wilderness; and ye will thus be destruction to all this people. 
\v 16 And they came near unto him, and said, Sheepfolds will we build for our cattle here, and cities for our little ones; 
\v 17 But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel, until that we have brought them unto their place; and our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities, because of the inhabitants of the land. 
\v 18 We will not return unto our houses, until the children of Israel have acquired for themselves every man his inheritance. 
\v 19 For we will not take possession with them on the other side of the Jordan, and farther on: when our inheritance hath come to us on this side of the Jordan eastward. 
\v 20 And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will arm yourselves before the Lord for the war; 
\v 21 And every armed man of you will go over the Jordan before the Lord, until he have driven out his enemies from before him; 
\v 22 And when, only after the land hath been subdued before the Lord, ye will return, and ye be thus guiltless before the Lord, and before Israel: then shall this land be yours for a possession before the Lord. 
\v 23 But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the Lord; and ye shall experience the punishment of your sin which will overtake you. 
\v 24 Build yourselves cities for your little ones, and folds for your flocks; and that which hath proceeded out of your mouth shall ye do. 
\v 25 And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben said unto Moses, as followeth, Thy servants will do as my Lord commandeth. 
\v 26 Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall remain there in the cities of Gil'ad; 
\v 27 But thy servants will pass over, every one that is armed for the army, before the Lord, to the war, as my Lord speaketh. 
\v 28 And Moses commanded concerning them Elazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the chiefs of the families of the tribes of the children of Israel; 
\v 29 And Moses said unto them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben do pass with you over the Jordan, every one that is armed for the war, before the Lord, and the land shall be subdued before you: then shall ye give to them the land of Gil'ad for a possession; 
\v 30 But if they should not pass over armed with you, they shall take possessions among you in the land of Canaan. 
\v 31 And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, That which the Lord hath spoken concerning thy servants, even so will we do. 
\v 32 We will indeed pass over armed before the Lord into the land of Canaan, while ours remaineth the possession of our inheritance on this side of the Jordan. 
\v 33 And Moses gave unto them, to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and to half the tribe of Menasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sichon, the king of the Emorites, and the kingdom of 'Og, the king of Bashan, the land, with its cities within the boundaries, the cities of the country round about. 
\v 34 And the children of Gad built Dibon, and 'Ataroth, and 'Aro'er, 
\v 35 And 'Atroth-shophan, and Ya'zer, and Yogbehah. 
\v 36 And Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran, fortified cities, and folds for flocks, 
\v 37 And the children of Reuben built Cheshbon, and El'aleh, and Kiryathayim, 
\v 38 And Nebo, and Ba'al-me'on [their names being changed], and Shibmah; and they gave the former names unto the cities which they built. 
\v 39 And the children of Machir the son of Menasseh went to Gil'ad, and conquered it, and dispossessed the Emorites who were in it. 
\v 40 And Moses gave Gil'ad unto Machir the son of Menasseh; and he dwelt therein. 
\v 41 And Yair the son of Menasseh went and conquered the small towns thereof, and called them Chavoth-yair. 
\v 42 And Nobach went and conquered Kenath, and the villages thereof, and called it Nobach, after his own name. 
\c 33  
\p
\v 1 These are the journeys of the children of Israel, who went forth out of the land of Egypt according to their armies, under the guidance of Moses and Aaron. 
\v 2 And Moses wrote their departures according to their journeys by the order of the Lord; and these are their journeys according to their departures. 
\v 3 And they set forward from Ra'meses in the first month; on the fifteenth day of the first month, on the morrow after the passover-sacrifice the children of Israel went out with a high hand before the eyes of all the Egyptians. 
\v 4 And the Egyptians were burying all the first-born, whom the Lord had smitten among them; and upon their gods also did the Lord execute judgments. 
\v 5 And the children of Israel removed from Ra'meses, and encamped in Succoth. 
\v 6 And they removed from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, which is on the edge of the wilderness: 
\v 7 And they removed from Etham, and returned unto Pi-hachiroth, which is before Ba'al-zephon; and they encamped before Migdol. 
\v 8 And they removed from before Pi-hachiroth, and passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness; and they went three days' journey in the wilderness of Etham, and encamped in Marah. 
\v 9 And they removed from Marah, and came unto Elim; and in Elim there were twelve springs of water, and seventy palm-trees; and they encamped there. 
\v 10 And they removed from Elim, and encamped by the Red Sea. 
\v 11 And they removed from the Red Sea, and encamped in the wilderness of Sin. 
\v 12 And they removed from the wilderness of Sin, and encamped in Dophkah. 
\v 13 And they removed from Dophkah, and encamped in Alush. 
\v 14 And they removed from Alush, and encamped at Rephidim, and there was no water for the people to drink. 
\v 15 And they removed from Rephidim, and encamped in the wilderness of Sinai. 
\v 16 And they removed from the wilderness of Sinai, and encamped in Kibroth-hattaavah. 
\v 17 And they removed from Kibroth-hattaavah, and encamped in Chazeroth. 
\v 18 And they removed from Chazeroth, and encamped in Rithmah. 
\v 19 And they removed from Rithmah, and encamped in Rimmon-perez. 
\v 20 And they removed from Rimmon-perez, and encamped in Libnah. 
\v 21 And they removed from Libnah, and encamped in Rissah. 
\v 22 And they removed from Rissah, and encamped in Kehelathah. 
\v 23 And they removed from Kehelathah, and encamped in mount Shapher. 
\v 24 And they removed from mount Shapher, and encamped in Charadah. 
\v 25 And they removed from Charadah, and encamped in Makheloth. 
\v 26 And they removed from Makheloth, and encamped in Tachath. 
\v 27 And they removed from Tachath, and encamped in Tarach. 
\v 28 And they removed from Tarach, and encamped in Mithkah. 
\v 29 And they removed from Mithkah, and encamped in Chashmonah. 
\v 30 And they removed from Chashmonah, and encamped in Mosseroth. 
\v 31 And they removed from Mosseroth, and encamped in Bene-ya'akan. 
\v 32 And they removed from Bene-ya'akan, and encamped in Chor-hagidgad. 
\v 33 And they removed from Chor-hagidgad, and encamped in Yotbathah. 
\v 34 And they removed from Yotbathah, and encamped in 'Abronah. 
\v 35 And they removed from 'Abronah, and encamped at 'Ezyon-geber. 
\v 36 And they removed from 'Ezyon-geber, and encamped in the wilderness of Zin, which is Kadesh. 
\v 37 And they removed from Kadesh, and encamped at mount Hor, in the edge of the land of Edom. 
\v 38 And Aaron the priest went up on mount Hor by the order of the Lord, and died there, in the fortieth year after the going out of the children of Israel from the land of Egypt, in the fifth month, on the first of the month. 
\v 39 And Aaron was a hundred and twenty and three years old when he died on mount Hor. 
\v 40 And the Canaanite the king of 'Arad, who dwelt on the south side in the land of Canaan, heard of the coming of the children of Israel. 
\v 41 And they removed from mount Hor, and encamped in Zalmonah. 
\v 42 And they removed from Zalmonah, and encamped in Punon. 
\v 43 And they removed from Punon, and encamped in Oboth. 
\v 44 And they removed from Oboth, and encamped in 'Iye-ha'abarim, on the border of Moab. 
\v 45 And they removed from Iyim, and encamped in Dibon-gad. 
\v 46 And they removed from Dibon-gad, and encamped in 'Almon-diblathaymah. 
\v 47 And they removed from 'Almon-diblathaymah, and encamped on the mountains of 'Abarim, before Nebo. 
\v 48 And they removed from the mountains of 'Abarim, and encamped in the plains of Moab by the Jordan opposite Jericho. 
\v 49 And they encamped by the Jordan, from Beth-hayeshimoth even unto Abel-hashittim in the plains of Moab. 
\v 50 And the Lord spoke unto Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan opposite Jericho, saying, 
\v 51 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan: 
\v 52 Then shall ye drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and ye shall destroy all their statues, and all their molten images shall ye destroy, and devastate all their high places. 
\v 53 And ye shall drive out [the inhabitants of] the land, and ye shall dwell therein; for unto you have I given the land to possess it. 
\v 54 And ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families; to the numerous shall ye give the more inheritance, and to the small in number shall ye give the less inheritance: there, where the lot designateth it for him, shall every one's possessions be; according to the tribes of your fathers shall ye divide it among yourselves. 
\v 55 But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you: then shall it come to pass, that those whom ye will let remain of them shall be as thorns in your eyes, and as stings in your sides, and they shall trouble you in the land wherein ye dwell. 
\v 56 And it shall come to pass, that as I purposed to do unto them, will I do unto you. 
\c 34  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, when ye come into the land of Canaan, shall this be the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance: The land of Canaan according to its boundaries. 
\v 3 And the southern side shall be unto you from the wilderness of Zin along by the boundary of Edom, and your southern border shall commence at the outmost edge of the Salt Sea on its east side. 
\v 4 And the border shall turn for you from the south of the ascent of 'Akrabbim, and pass on to Zin; and its terminating points shall be to the south of Kadesh-barnea', and shall go on to Chazar-addar, and pass on to Azmon; 
\v 5 And the border shall turn from 'Azmon unto the river of Egypt, and its terminating points shall be at the sea. 
\v 6 And as the western border, shall ye have the Great Sea for a border: this shall be your western border. 
\v 7 And this shall be unto you the northern border: from the Great Sea shall ye mark out for you [the boundary to] mount Hor; 
\v 8 From mount Hor shall ye mark out [the boundary] unto the entrance of Chamath; and the terminations of the border shall be toward Zedad; 
\v 9 And the border shall go on to Ziphron, and its terminating points shall be at Chazar'-enan: this shall be unto you the northern border. 
\v 10 And ye shall turn yourselves to the eastern border, from Chazar-'enan to Shepham; 
\v 11 And the boundary shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, to the eastward of 'Ayin; and the boundary shall descend, and shall touch upon the coast of the sea of Kinnereth, eastward; 
\v 12 And the border shall go down to the Jordan, and its terminating points shall be at the Salt Sea: this shall be your land after its boundaries round about. 
\v 13 And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This is the land which ye shall divide among yourselves by lot, which the Lord hath commanded to give unto the nine tribes, and to the half tribe. 
\v 14 For the tribe of the children of Reuben according to their family divisions, and the tribe of the children of Gad according to their family divisions, have received,—and the half of the tribe of Menasseh have received their inheritance; 
\v 15 The two tribes and the half tribe have received their inheritance on this side of the Jordan opposite Jericho eastward, toward the rising of the sun. 
\v 16 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 17 These are the names of the men who shall parcel out unto you the land: Elazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun. 
\v 18 And one prince each from every tribe shall ye take to parcel out the land. 
\v 19 And these are the names of the men: Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Yephunneh: 
\v 20 And of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of 'Ammihud; 
\v 21 Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Kisslon; 
\v 22 And of the tribe of the children of Dan the prince, Bukki the son of Yogli; 
\v 23 Of the children of Joseph, for the tribe of the children of Menasseh the prince, Channiel the son of Ephod; 
\v 24 And of the tribe of the children of Ephraim the prince, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan; 
\v 25 And of the tribe of the children of Zebulun the prince, Elizaphan the son of Parnach; 
\v 26 And of the tribe of the children of Issachar the prince, Paltiel the son of 'Azzan; 
\v 27 And of the tribe of the children of Asher the prince, Achihud the son of Shelomi; 
\v 28 And of the tribe of the children of Naphtali the prince, Pedahel the son of 'Ammihud. 
\v 29 These are they whom the Lord hath commanded to divide out the inheritance unto the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.

\v 1 And the Lord spoke unto Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan opposite Jericho, saying, 
\v 2 Command the children of Israel, that they give unto the Levites from the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and an open space for the cities round about them shall ye give [also] unto the Levites. 
\v 3 And the cities shall serve them to dwell in; and their open spaces shall be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for all their requirements. 
\v 4 And the open spaces of the cities, which ye shall give unto the Levites, shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about. 
\v 5 And ye shall measure from without the city on the east side two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits, with the city in the midst: this shall be to them the open spaces of the cities. 
\v 6 And the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites shall be the six cities of refuge, which ye shall appoint that the manslayer may flee thither; and in addition to them shall ye give forty and two cities. 
\v 7 All the cities which ye shall [thus] give to the Levites shall be forty and eight cities, they with their open spaces. 
\v 8 And the cities which ye shall give of the possession of the children of Israel, from the tribe that hath many shall ye give many; but from the one that hath few shall ye give few: every one according to its inheritance which it may inherit shall give of its cities unto the Levites. 
\v 9 And the Lord spoke unto Moses. saying, 
\v 10 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye have passed over the Jordan into the land of Canaan: 
\v 11 Then ye shall appoint unto yourselves proper cities, that they be cities of refuge for you; and thither shall flee the manslayer who killeth any person at unawares. 
\v 12 And these cities shall be unto you for a refuge from the avenger; that the manslayer die not, until he have stood before the congregation for trial. 
\v 13 And the cities which ye shall give, shall be six cities of refuge unto you; 
\v 14 Three of these cities shall ye give on this side of the Jordan, and the three other cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan: cities of refuge shall they be. 
\v 15 For the children of Israel, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them, shall these six cities be for a refuge: that every one may flee thither that killeth any person at unawares. 
\v 16 And if he have smitten him with an instrument of iron, so that he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death. 
\v 17 And if he have smitten him with a stone which one can take in the hand, wherewith he may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death. 
\v 18 Or if he have smitten him with an article of wood, which one can take in the hand, wherewith he may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death. 
\v 19 The avenger of the blood himself shall slay the murderer; when he meeteth him, shall he slay him. 
\v 20 And if he push against him out of hatred, or he have hurled at him [any thing] by lying in wait, that he die; 
\v 21 Or if in enmity he have smitten him with his hand, that he died, he that smote him shall surely be put to death; [for] he is a murderer: the avenger of the blood shall slay the murderer, when he meeteth with him. 
\v 22 But if he have pushed against him accidentally without enmity, or have cast upon him any thing without lying in wait, 
\v 23 Or with any stone wherewith a man may die, without seeing him, and he have let it fall upon him that he died; whereas he was not his enemy, and did not seek his harm: 
\v 24 Then shall the congregation judge between the slayer and the avenger of the blood according to these institutions; 
\v 25 And the congregation shall deliver the manslayer out of the hand of the avenger of the blood, and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge, whither he had fled; and he shall abide in it until the death of the high-priest, who hath been anointed with the holy oil. 
\v 26 But if the manslayer should at any time pass the boundary of the city of his refuge, whither he may have fled; 
\v 27 And the avenger of the blood should find him beyond the boundary of the city of his refuge, and the avenger of the blood should kill the manslayer: he shall not be guilty of blood; 
\v 28 Because in the city of his refuge shall be remain until the death of the high-priest; but after the death of the high-priest the manslayer may return unto the land of his possession. 
\v 29 And these things shall be unto you for a statute of justice throughout your generations, in all your dwellings. 
\v 30 Whoever it be that killeth a person, according to the testimony of witnesses shall the murderer be put to death; but one witness shall not testify against any person to cause him to die. 
\v 31 Moreover ye shall take no redemption money for the person of a murderer, who is guilty of death; but he shall surely be put to death. 
\v 32 And ye shall take no redemption money for him that hath fled to the city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest. 
\v 33 And ye shall not defile the land wherein ye are; for the blood it is which defileth the land: and no atonement can be made unto the land for the blood which hath been shed therein, except through the blood of him that hath shed it. 
\v 34 And ye shall not render unclean the land which ye inhabit, in the midst of which I dwell; for I the Lord dwell in the midst of the children of Israel.

\v 1 And there came near the chiefs of the divisions of the family of the children of Gil'ad, the son of Machir, the son of Menasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph; and they spoke before Moses, and before the princes, the chiefs of the divisions of the children of Israel; 
\v 2 And they said, the Lord hath commanded my Lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel; and my Lord hath been commanded by the Lord to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters. 
\v 3 And if they become the wives of any of the sons of the [other] tribes of the children of Israel: then will their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and be added to the inheritance of the tribe whereamong they may be married; and from the lot of our inheritance will it be taken away. 
\v 4 And whenever the jubilee shall be to the children of Israel: then will their inheritance be added unto the inheritance of the tribe whereamong they may be married; and from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers will their inheritance be taken away. 
\v 5 And Moses commanded the children of Israel by the order of the Lord, saying, the tribe of the sons of Joseph have spoken well. 
\v 6 This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, To those who are pleasing in their eyes may they become wives; however only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they become wives. 
\v 7 And the inheritance of the children of Israel shall not pass from tribe to tribe; but the children of Israel shall adhere every one to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers. 
\v 8 And every daughter that inheriteth any possession out of any tribe of the children of Israel, shall become the wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father; in order that the children of Israel may inherit every one the inheritance of his fathers. 
\v 9 And no inheritance shall pass from one tribe to another tribe; but the tribes of the children of Israel shall adhere, every one, to his own inheritance. 
\v 10 Even as the Lord had commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad; 
\v 11 And Machlah, Tirzah, and Choglah, and Milcah, and No'ah, the daughters of Zelophehad became the wives of the sons of their uncles. 
\v 12 [To persons] of the families of the sons of Menasseh the son of Joseph did they become wives, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father. 
\v 13 These are the commandments and the ordinances, which the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel, in the plain of Moab by the Jordan opposite Jericho.
