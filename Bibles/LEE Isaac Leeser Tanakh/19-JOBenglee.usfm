\v 1 There was a man in the land of 'Uz, Job was his name; And this man was perfect and upright, and fearing God, and eschewing evil. 
\v 2 And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters. 
\v 3 And his cattle consisted of seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and he had a very great store of servants: so that this man was greater than all the sons of the east. 
\v 4 And his sons used to go and prepare a feast in the house of every one on his day; and they sent and invited their three sisters to eat and to drink with them. 
\v 5 And it happened, when the days of the feast were gone round, that Job sent and sanctified them, and he then rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt-offerings according to the number of all of them; for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and have renounced God in their heart. In this manner used Job to do all the time. 
\v 6 Now it happened on a certain day, when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, that the Accuser also came in the midst of them. 
\v 7 Then said the Lord unto the Accuser, Whence comest thou? And the Accuser answered the Lord, and said, From roaming over the earth, and from wandering through it. 
\v 8 Then said the Lord unto the Accuser, Hast thou directed thy attention toward my servant Job; for there is none like him on the earth, a man perfect and upright, who feareth God, and escheweth evil? 
\v 9 Then answered the Accuser the Lord, and said, Is it for nought that Job feareth God? 
\v 10 Behold, thou hast indeed placed a fence about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath, on every side: the work of his hands hast thou blessed, and his cattle are far spread out in the land. 
\v 11 But stretch only forth thy hand and touch all that he hath, and [see] whether he will not renounce thee to thy face. 
\v 12 Then said the Lord unto the Accuser, Behold, all that is his be in thy power; only against himself shalt thou not stretch forth thy hand. The Accuser went thereupon away from the presence of the Lord. 
\v 13 And it happened on a certain day, when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their first-born brother, 
\v 14 That a messenger came unto Job, and said, The oxen were ploughing, and the she-asses were feeding beside them: 
\v 15 When the Sabeans made an incursion, and took them away, and the young men they slew with the edge of the sword; and I am escaped, none but myself alone, to tell it unto thee. 
\v 16 This one was yet speaking, when another came, and said, A fire of God fell from heaven, and burnt among the sheep and the young men, and consumed them; and I am escaped, none but myself alone, to tell it unto thee. 
\v 17 This one was yet speaking, when another came, and said, The Chaldeans posted themselves in three divisions, and made an inroad against the camels, and took them away, and the young men they slew with the edge of the sword; and I am escaped, none but myself alone, to tell it unto thee. 
\v 18 While this one was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their first-born brother: 
\v 19 When, behold, a violent wind came from the direction of the wilderness, and struck against the four corners of the house, so that it fell upon the young men, and they died; and I am escaped, none but myself alone, to tell it unto thee. 
\v 20 Then arose Job, and rent his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and prostrated himself. 
\v 21 And he said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; may the name of the Lord be blessed. 
\v 22 With all this did Job not sin, and attributed no injustice to God. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 And it happened [again] on a certain day, when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, that the Accuser also came in the midst of them to present himself before the Lord. 
\v 2 Then said the Lord unto the Accuser, Whence comest thou now? And the Accuser answered the Lord, and said, From roaming over the earth, and from wandering through it. 
\v 3 Then said the Lord unto the Accuser, Hast thou directed thy attention toward my servant Job: for there is none like him on the earth, a man perfect and upright, who feareth God, and escheweth evil? and he is still holding fast to his integrity, and thou hast incited me against him, to destroy him without cause. 
\v 4 Then answered the Accuser the Lord, and said, Skin for skin: yea, all that a man hath will he give in behalf of his life. 
\v 5 But stretch only forth thy hand, and touch his bone and his flesh, and [see] whether he will not renounce thee to thy face. 
\v 6 Then said the Lord unto the Accuser, Behold, he is in thy hand: only take care of his life. 
\v 7 Thereupon went the Accuser forth from the presence of the Lord, and he smote Job with a sore inflammation, from the sole of his foot unto the crown of his head. 
\v 8 And [Job] took himself a potsherd to scrape himself there with, while he was sitting down among the ashes. 
\v 9 Then said his wife unto him, Art thou still holding fast to thy integrity? renounce God, and die. 
\v 10 But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the worthless women would speak. What? should we accept the good alone, from God, and the evil we should not accept? With all this did Job not sin with his lips. 
\v 11 When now the three friends of Job had heard of all this evil that was come over him, they came every one from his own place, Eliphaz the Themanite, and Bildad the Shuchite, and Zophar the Na'amthite; and they met together to come to condole with him and to comfort him. 
\v 12 And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and they recognised him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his robe, and strewed dust upon their heads toward heaven. 
\v 13 They likewise sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights; but no one spoke a word unto him; for they saw that his pain was very great. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 After this time Job opened his mouth, and cursed his day. 
\v 2 And Job commenced, and said, 
\v 3 Oh that the day whereon I was born might perish, and the night when it was said, There hath been a male child conceived. 
\v 4 May that day be [covered with] darkness; may not God from above inquire for it, and may no light beam upon it. 
\v 5 Oh that darkness and the shadow of death might defile it; may a cloud rest upon it; may the blackness of the day terrify it. 
\v 6 Yon night — let darkness seize upon it; let it not be united to the days of the year; let it not come into the number of the [periods lighted by the] moon. 
\v 7 Lo, may that night be solitary, let no song of joy occur thereon. 
\v 8 Let those denounce it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning cry. 
\v 9 Let the stars of its twilight be darkened; let it hope for light, and there be none; and let it not behold the eyelids of the morning-dawn; 
\v 10 Because God closed not against me the doors of the womb, and thus concealed trouble from my eyes. 
\v 11 Why did I not die [the moment I issued] from the womb, and [why] was I not born merely to perish at once? 
\v 12 Wherefore were knees ready to receive me? and for what purpose were breasts there that I might suck? 
\v 13 For now should I be lying still and be quiet; I should sleep: then would I be at rest, 
\v 14 With kings and counsellors of the earth, who build up ruined places for themselves; 
\v 15 Or with princes possessing gold, who fill their houses with silver; 
\v 16 Or as an untimely birth, hidden [from view] I should not exist; as infants that never have seen the light; 
\v 17 There [where] the wicked cease from troubling; and where the exhausted weary are at rest; 
\v 18 [Where] the prisoners repose together, [and] they hear no more the taskmaster's voice. 
\v 19 The small with the great is there, and the servant free from his master. 
\v 20 Wherefore giveth He now light to the labor-laden, and life unto the bitter in soul? 
\v 21 Who wait for death, which [cometh] not; and who dig for it sooner than for hidden treasures; 
\v 22 Who would rejoice even to exulting, who would be glad could they but find a grave? 
\v 23 [Why is light given] to a man whose way is hidden, and around whom God hath placed a fence? 
\v 24 For before my food cometh my groaning, and like the water are poured forth my loud complaints. 
\v 25 Because what I greatly dreaded is come upon me, and what I apprehended is come unto me. 
\v 26 I have had no safety, and no quiet, and no rest; and [now] harrowing trouble is come. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 Then answered Eliphaz the Themanite, and said, 
\v 2 If we essay to address a word to thee, wilt thou be wearied? yet who is able to refrain from speaking? 
\v 3 Behold, thou hast [ere this] corrected many, and weak hands thou wast wont to strengthen. 
\v 4 Him that stumbled thy words used to uphold, and to sinking knees thou gavest vigor. 
\v 5 Yet now, when it cometh to thee, thou art wearied: it toucheth even thee, and thou art terrified. 
\v 6 Is not then thy fear of God still thy confidence, thy hope equal to the integrity of thy ways? 
\v 7 Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous destroyed? 
\v 8 Even as I have seen, that those who plough wrong-doing, and sow trouble, have to reap the same. 
\v 9 Before the breathing of God they perish, and before the breath of his nostrils they come to their end. 
\v 10 The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken. 
\v 11 The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the whelps of the lioness have to scatter themselves abroad. 
\v 12 But to me a word came by stealth, and my ear took in a scarcely perceptible whisper thereof. 
\v 13 In intense thoughts out of visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men: 
\v 14 Dread came over me, with trembling, and it caused all my bones to shudder. 
\v 15 Then flitted a spirit past before my face; the hair of my body stood up: 
\v 16 It stood still, but I could not recognize its form; a figure was before my eyes, a slight whisper, then a [louder] voice I heard, saying, 
\v 17 Can a mortal be more righteous than God? or can a man be more pure than his Maker? 
\v 18 Behold, in his servants he putteth no trust, and his angels he chargeth with folly: 
\v 19 How much less in those that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed till they come to be eaten by the moth? 
\v 20 From morning to evening are they broken to pieces: without laying it [to heart] they perish for ever. 
\v 21 Behold, their excellency which is in them is torn away: they die, and this without wisdom. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 Do but call: is there one that will answer thee? and to whom of the saints wilt thou turn thyself? 
\v 2 For vexation will prove death to a foolish man, and jealousy will slay the simple. 
\v 3 I have myself seen the foolish taking root; but I suddenly held his habitation as accursed. 
\v 4 His children are far from help, and men crush them in the gate, with no one to deliver them. 
\v 5 [He it is] whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber snatcheth eagerly after their substance. 
\v 6 For wrong doth not come forth out of the dust, neither doth trouble grow up out of the ground; 
\v 7 But man is born unto trouble, as young birds take up their flight. 
\v 8 I, however, would have besought God, and unto God would I have committed my cause; 
\v 9 Who doth great things which are unsearchable, marvelous things till they are without number; 
\v 10 Who giveth rain upon the surface of the earth, and sendeth out waters over the face of the fields; 
\v 11 To set up the lowly on high, that those who mourn may rise high to happiness; 
\v 12 [But] who frustrateth the plans of the crafty, so that their hands cannot execute their well-devised counsel; 
\v 13 Who catcheth the wise in their own craftiness; and the advise of the perverse is hastened on headlong; 
\v 14 By day they meet with darkness, and as though it were night they grope about in the noon of day; 
\v 15 But who saveth from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty, the needy one: 
\v 16 And so cometh to the indigent hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth. 
\v 17 Behold, happy is the man whom God admonisheth: despise then not the correction of the Almighty. 
\v 18 For he it is that woundeth, and bindeth up: he smiteth, and his hands do heal. 
\v 19 In six distresses will he deliver thee; and in seven there shall no evil touch thee. 
\v 20 In famine he redeemeth thee from death; and in war from the power of the sword. 
\v 21 Against the scourge of the tongue shall thou he hidden; and thou needest not be afraid of destruction when it cometh. 
\v 22 At destruction and famine canst thou laugh; and thou needest not have any fear of the beasts of the earth. 
\v 23 For with the stones of the field shalt thou have thy covenant; and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee. 
\v 24 And thou shalt know that there is peace in thy tent; and thou wilt look over thy habitation, and shalt miss nothing. 
\v 25 And thou shalt know that thy seed is numerous, and thy offspring as the herbage of the earth. 
\v 26 Thon wilt go in a ripe age unto the grave, as a shock of corn is carried home in its season. 
\v 27 Behold this, we have searched it out, so it is: hear it, and do thou note it well for thyself. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1 Then answered Job, and said, 
\v 2 Oh that my vexation could be truly weighed, and my calamity; oh that men might lift it up in the balances at once! 
\v 3 For now it is already heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore are my words confused. 
\v 4 For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof my spirit drinketh it: the terrors of God set themselves in array against me. 
\v 5 Doth the wild ass bray over the grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder? 
\v 6 Is ever tasteless food eaten without salt? or is there any flavor in the white of an egg? 
\v 7 My soul refuseth to touch them: they are unto me like disgusting food. 
\v 8 Oh that some one would grant the accomplishment of my request; and that God would grant me the fulfillment of my hope! 
\v 9 Yea, that it would please God that he might crush me: that he would let loose his hand, and make an end of me! 
\v 10 Then would this be still my comfort; yea, I would rejoice in my pain while be would not spare: that I have not gainsaid the commands of the Holy One.— 
\v 11 What is my strength, that I should wait? and what my end, that I should yet longer retain my patience? 
\v 12 Is the strength of stones my strength? or is my flesh brazen? 
\v 13 Truly, am I not without my help in me? and is not wise counsel driven far away from me? 
\v 14 As though I were one who refuseth kindness to his friend, and forsaketh the fear of the Almighty: 
\v 15 My brothers are treacherous as a brook, like flowing brooks they pass along; 
\v 16 Which are made turbid by reason of the ice, wherein the snow hideth itself; 
\v 17 At the time when they feel the warmth, they vanish; when it is hot, they are quenched out of their place. 
\v 18 The paths of their course wind themselves along; they go in the wilderness and are lost. 
\v 19 The caravans of Thema look hither, the travelling companies Sheba hope for them; 
\v 20 But they stand ashamed because they had trusted; they come thither and are made to blush. 
\v 21 For truly now ye are like such a one: ye see my terrible state and are afraid. 
\v 22 Have I then ever said, Give me something, and out of your property offer a bribe in my behalf? 
\v 23 And deliver me from the hand of the adversary? and redeem from the hand of tyrants? 
\v 24 Teach me, and I will indeed remain silent; and wherein I erred give me to understand. 
\v 25 How pleasant are straightforward words! but what doth arguing prove? 
\v 26 Do ye think to reprove words, and [to regard] as wind the speeches of one that is despairing? 
\v 27 Yea, ye would cast any thing upon the fatherless, and ye would dig a pit against your friend. 
\v 28 But now, if it please you, turn yourselves toward me, and [say] whether I would lie before your face. 
\v 29 Reflect again, I pray you, there will be no wrong: yea, reflect once more, my righteousness [will be found] therein. 
\v 30 Is there any wrong on my tongue? or should my palate not understand [if I spoke] what is iniquitous? 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1 Is there not a limited time of service to a mortal upon the earth? Are not his days also like the days of a hired laborer? 
\v 2 As a servant eagerly longeth for the shadow, and as a hired laborer hopeth for his reward: 
\v 3 So was I compelled to possess months of vanity, and nights of trouble were counted out unto me. 
\v 4 When I He down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am wearied with tossings about till the dawn of day. 
\v 5 My flesh is covered with worms and clods of dust: my skin is burst open, and become loathsome. 
\v 6 My days hasten away more swiftly than a weaver's shuttle, and they come to an end in the absence of hope. 
\v 7 Oh remember that nothing but a breath is my life; that my eye will not again see happiness; 
\v 8 The eye of him that seeth me now will not behold me again: [thou fixest] thy eyes upon me, and I am no more. 
\v 9 As the cloud vanisheth and passeth away: so will he that goeth down to the nether world not come up again. 
\v 10 He will return no more to his house, and his place will not recognize him any more. 
\v 11 Therefore will I also not restrain my mouth: I will speak in the anguish of my spirit: I will complain in the bitterness of my soul. 
\v 12 Am I a sea, or a monster, that thou settest a watch over me? 
\v 13 For should I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall help me bear my complaint: 
\v 14 Then wouldst thou frighten me with dreams, and with visions wouldst thou terrify me; 
\v 15 So that my soul would choose strangling, death rather than these limbs of mine. 
\v 16 I loathe it; I cannot live for ever: let me alone; for my days are but nought. 
\v 17 What is the mortal, that thou shouldst make him great? and that thou shouldst direct thy heart toward him? 
\v 18 And that thou shouldst visit him every morning, probe him every moment? 
\v 19 How long wilt thou not turn thy regard from me, nor let; me loose till I swallow down my spittle? 
\v 20 If I have sinned, what [injury] can I cause unto thee, O thou Guardian of men? why hast thou set me as an object for thee to strike at, so that I am become a burden to myself? 
\v 21 And why wilt thou not forgive my transgression, and let my iniquity pass away? for soon must I lie down in the dust; and thou wilt seek for me, but I shall be no more. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1 Then answered Bildad the Shuchite, and said, 
\v 2 How long wilt thou speak these things? and [let] like a mighty wind be the words of thy mouth? 
\v 3 Should God pervert justice? or should the Almighty pervert righteousness? 
\v 4 If thy children have sinned against him, then did he send them off through the means of their transgression. 
\v 5 If thou wilt earnestly seek for God, and make thy supplication to the Almighty; 
\v 6 If thou become pure and upright: surely then will he watch over thee, and restore thy righteous habitation. 
\v 7 And thy beginning will have been small; because thy latter end will grow up greatly. 
\v 8 For ask, I pray thee, of an earlier generation, and prepare thyself to [stand by] the research of their fathers;— 
\v 9 For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because a [mere] shadow are our days upon earth;— 
\v 10 Behold, these will truly teach thee, they will speak unto thee, and out of their very heart will they bring forth words: 
\v 11 Can the bulrush shoot upward without mire? can the meadow-grass grow up without water? 
\v 12 It is yet in its greenness, not yet cut down, when it withereth before any other grass. 
\v 13 So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hope of the hypocrite will perish: 
\v 14 [It is he] whose trust will be cut off, and but a spider's web is that in which he confideth. 
\v 15 He leaneth against his house, but it shall not stand: he layeth fast hold on it, but it shall not remain erect. 
\v 16 He is in full vigor before the sun, and over his garden his shoots go forth. 
\v 17 His roots are twisted about a stoneheap, he selecteth [for himself] a place of stones. 
\v 18 But when men destroy him from his place, then will it deny him, saying, I have never seen thee. 
\v 19 Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the [same] dust others will grow up. 
\v 20 Behold, God will not reject a perfect man, and will not hold fast by their hand the evil-doers: 
\v 21 Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with joyful shouting. 
\v 22 They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the tent of the wicked shall be no more. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 Then answered Job, and said, 
\v 2 Truly I know that it is so: and how could a mortal be righteous before God? 
\v 3 If he were desirous to enter into a contest with him, he could not give him one answer out of a thousand. 
\v 4 He is wise of heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and escaped unscathed? 
\v 5 [He it is] who removeth mountains, and they know it not, yea, when he overturneth them in his anger; 
\v 6 Who shaketh the earth loose out of her place, that her pillars tremble; 
\v 7 Who speaketh to the sun, and he shineth not, and around the stars he placeth a seal; 
\v 8 Who spread out the heavens by himself alone, and treadeth upon the hillocks of the sea; 
\v 9 Who made the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, and the chambers the south; 
\v 10 Who doth great things which are quite unsearchable, and wonders which are quite without number. 
\v 11 Lo, were he to go past by me, I should not see him; and were he to pass along, I should not perceive him. 
\v 12 Behold, were he to snatch aught away, who could hold him back? who would say unto him, What dost thou? 
\v 13 God will not withdraw his anger: beneath him sink down the helpers of the proud. 
\v 14 How much less then could I answer him, and select my words [to contend] with him? 
\v 15 Whom, were I even righteous, I could not answer? to him that condemneth me I could [only] make supplication. 
\v 16 Or were I to call, and he would answer me, I could yet not believe that he would give ear unto my voice— 
\v 17 He that bruiseth me with [his] tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without a cause. 
\v 18 He suffereth me not to recover my breath; but feedeth me overmuch with bitter things. 
\v 19 If it regard strength, lo, he is the powerful; and if justice, who will cite him for me to appear? 
\v 20 If I were righteous even, my own mouth would condemn me: were I innocent, it would still prove me perverse. 
\v 21 I am innocent; I will not have regard for myself: I will despise my life. 
\v 22 One thing is [certain], therefore have I said it, The innocent and the wicked he bringeth to their end. 
\v 23 If a scourge should slay suddenly, he will mock at the trial of the guiltless. 
\v 24 Is a land given up into the hand of the wicked? he covereth the faces of its judges: if this be not the truth, who is it then? 
\v 25 And my days pass swifter than a runner: they flee away, they see no happiness, 
\v 26 They hasten along like pirate ships: like the eagle that stoopeth down upon his food. 
\v 27 If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my sorrowful countenance, and recover my cheerfulness: 
\v 28 O then would I be in dread of all my pains; I know that thou wilt not declare me innocent. 
\v 29 I must ever be guilty: why then should I fatigue myself for nought? 
\v 30 If I were to wash myself in snow-water, to cleanse myself in the purity of my hands: 
\v 31 Even then wouldst thou plunge me in the ditch, that my own clothes would render me abhorred. 
\v 32 For he is not a man, like me, that I could answer him, that we should enter together into a contest. 
\v 33 There is no one who can decide between us, who could lay his hand upon us both. 
\v 34 Let him but remove from me his rod, and let not his dread terrify me: 
\v 35 Then would I speak, and not fear him; for the like I feel not within me. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1 My soul is disgusted with my life; I will give free vent to my complaint over myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul. 
\v 2 I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; let me know for what cause thou contendest against me. 
\v 3 Is it well for thee that thou shouldst oppress, that thou shouldst reject the labor of thy hands, and shed light upon the counsel of the wicked? 
\v 4 Hast thou eyes of flesh? or wilt thou see as a mortal seeth? 
\v 5 Are thy days as the days of a mortal, or are thy years as the days of a man, 
\v 6 That thou inquirest after my iniquity, and searchest after my sin? 
\v 7 Still it is within thy knowledge that I am not wicked, and there is none that can deliver me out of thy hand. 
\v 8 Thy hands have carefully fashioned me and made me; every thing is in harmony all round about; and yet thou dost destroy me! 
\v 9 Remember, I beseech thee, that as though I were clay hast thou made me; and wilt thou cause me to return again unto the dust? 
\v 10 Behold, like milk didst thou pour me out, and like cheese didst thou curdle me. 
\v 11 With skin and flesh didst thou clothe me, and with bones and sinews didst thou cover me. 
\v 12 Life and kindness didst thou grant me, and thy providence watched over my spirit. 
\v 13 And yet these things hadst thou treasured up in thy heart: I know that this was [resolved] within thee. 
\v 14 If I have sinned, then dost thou watch me, and from my iniquity thou wilt not declare me guiltless. 
\v 15 If I be wicked, woe unto me: and if I be righteous, I can still not lift up my head; I am sated with disgrace, and ever seeing my affliction; 
\v 16 And it constantly increaseth; like a fierce lion dost thou hunt for me; and again thou showest thyself continually wonderful on me; 
\v 17 Thou ever renewest thy witnesses against me, and causest thy indignation to grow strong against me; changes and multitudes [of sufferings] are around me. 
\v 18 Wherefore then didst thou bring me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had perished, and that no eye had seen me! 
\v 19 That I were as though I had not been,—had been borne from the womb to the grave. 
\v 20 Lo! my days are but few: cease, then, withdraw from me [thy hand], that I may recover my cheerfulness a little. 
\v 21 Before I go, and return not, to the land of darkness and the shadow of death, 
\v 22 A land of utter gloom, as of the darkness of the shadow of death, without any order, and the light of which is like utter gloom. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 Then answered Zophar the Na'amathite, and said. 
\v 2 Shall a multitude of words not be answered? and is it so that a man full of talk shall be deemed in the right? 
\v 3 Thy inventions are to bring men to silence; and when thou utterest thy mocking no one is to cause thee to feel abashed! 
\v 4 For thou hast said [to God], My doctrine is pure, and I am become clean in thy eyes. 
\v 5 But oh that God would but speak, and open his lips against thee; 
\v 6 And that he would declare unto thee the secrets of wisdom; for it is double to that which is really in our possession: and thou wouldst experience that God overlooketh unto thee much of thy iniquity. 
\v 7 Canst thou find out the experience of God? or canst thou find [the way] unto the utmost limit of the Almighty? 
\v 8 It is as high as heaven; what canst thou effect? it is deeper than the nether world; what canst thou know? 
\v 9 Longer than the earth is its measure, and broader than the sea. 
\v 10 If he pass by, and surrender [one to suffering], and call together an assembly, who can hinder him? 
\v 11 For he knoweth the men of vanity: he seeth the wrong-doer and him who considereth not; 
\v 12 And the heartless who acquireth intelligence, and him who is [like] the colt of the wild ass who is transformed into a man. 
\v 13 If thou truly direct [aright] thy heart, and spread out thy hands toward him: — 
\v 14 If wrong be in thy hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tents. 
\v 15 For then canst thou lift up thy face free from blemish: yea, thou wilt stand steadfast, and needest not to fear; 
\v 16 Because thou wilt truly forget thy trouble, and as a waterflood that is passed away wilt thou remember it; 
\v 17 And brighter than the noon of day will thy earthly existence arise; and thy obscurity will be like thy morning. 
\v 18 And thou wilt feel trust, because there is hope: yea, thou wilt search about carefully, and thou wilt lie down in safety. 
\v 19 Also thou wilt stretch thyself out [to rest], with none to make thee afraid; and many will entreat thy favor. 
\v 20 But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and the means of escape will vanish from them, and their [sole] hope shall be the breathing out of their soul. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 Then answered Job, and said, 
\v 2 Truly ye are indeed the [right kind of] people, and with you wisdom must die out. 
\v 3 I also have sense like you; I do not fall short compared with you: and who possesseth not such things as these? 
\v 4 I am as one laughed at by his friend, who calleth upon God, while he answered him: [yea,] a laughing-stock though righteous and innocent. 
\v 5 To the unfortunate there is given contempt— according to the thoughts of him that is at ease— prepared [also] for those whose foot slippeth. 
\v 6 Prosperous are the tents of robbers, and security is given to those that provoke God. to him who carrieth his god in his hand. 
\v 7 Yet, do only ask of the beasts, and they will instruct thee; and the fowls of the heavens, and they will tell it thee; 
\v 8 Or speak to the earth, and she will instruct thee; and the fishes of the sea will inform thee 
\v 9 Who knoweth not through all these that the hand of the Lord hath wrought this? 
\v 10 [He] in whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the spirit of all the bodies of men? 
\v 11 Doth not the ear try words, as the palate tasteth food for itself? 
\v 12 So It with the ancients wisdom, and with [those of] length of days understanding, 
\v 13 That with him are wisdom and strength, his are counsel and understanding. 
\v 14 Behold, he pulleth down, and there can be no rebuilding: he locketh [the prison] upon a man, and there can be no opening, 
\v 15 Behold, he restraineth the waters, and they dry up; or he suffereth them to flow, and they overturn the earth. 
\v 16 With him are strength and counsel: his are the deceived and the deceiver. 
\v 17 He leadeth counsellors away bereft of sense, and maketh the judges fools. 
\v 18 He looseth the bond of kings, and bindeth a girdle around their loins. 
\v 19 He leadeth priests away bereft of sense, and the powerful he causeth to walk on crooked paths. 
\v 20 He removeth the speech from trusty speakers, and taketh away the intelligence of the aged. 
\v 21 He poureth contempt upon princes, and the belt of the mighty be looseneth. 
\v 22 He layeth open deep things from the midst of darkness, and bringeth out unto light the shadow of death. 
\v 23 He permitteth the nations to become great, and destroyeth them: he spreadeth out the nations, and leadeth them away. 
\v 24 He taketh away the sense of the chiefs of the people of the land, and causeth them to wander astray in a wilderness when there is no way. 
\v 25 They grope in the dark without light, and he causeth them to wander astray like a drunken man. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 Lo, all [this] hath my eye seen, my ear hath heard and noted it for itself; 
\v 2 As much as ye know, do I also know: I do not fall short compared with you. 
\v 3 However, I would gladly speak to the Almighty; and to argue with God do I desire. 
\v 4 But ye are inventors of falsehood, physicians of no value are all of you. 
\v 5 Oh, who would grant that ye might keep a profound silences! and it would he accounted unto you as wisdom. 
\v 6 Do hearken but to my reasoning, and listen to the pleadings of my lips. 
\v 7 Will ye speak wrong things for God? and will ye speak for him deceitfully? 
\v 8 Will ye show him undue favor, when ye contend for God? 
\v 9 Will it be well if he should search you out? or as one overreacheth another mortal, do ye expect to overreach him? 
\v 10 He will surely reprove you, if in secret you show him undue favor. 
\v 11 Doth not his excellency terrify you? and his dread fall upon you? 
\v 12 The things you remember are mere proverbs of ashes, your high-places are high-places of clay. 
\v 13 Keep silence toward me, that I may indeed speak, and let pass over me what will. 
\v 14 Whatever it may cost, I will take my flesh in my teeth, and my life will I put in my hand. 
\v 15 Lo, though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: only I will argue my own ways before him. 
\v 16 Even he will come to my assistance; for a hypocrite cannot come before him. 
\v 17 Listen well to my word, and to my demonstration with your ears. 
\v 18 Behold now, I have arrayed my cause: I know that I shall be indeed justified. 
\v 19 Who is he that will contend with me? for now, if I keep silence, I must perish. 
\v 20 Only two things do not unto me: then will I not hide myself from thy presence. 
\v 21 Remove thy hand far from me; and let not thy dread terrify me. 
\v 22 Then call thou, and I will answer; or let me speak, and do thou reply to me. 
\v 23 How many are my iniquities and sins? my transgression and my sin let me know. 
\v 24 Wherefore wilt thou hide thy face, and regard me as an enemy unto thee? 
\v 25 Wilt thou terrify a leaf driven about [by the wind]? and wilt thou pursue dry stubble? 
\v 26 That thou writest bitter decrees against me, and assignest unto me the iniquities of my youth; 
\v 27 And [that] thou puttest my feet in the stocks, and watchest narrowly all my paths; [and] settest for thyself a mark upon the soles of my feet? 
\v 28 And yet the body decayeth like a rotten thing, as a garment that the moth hath eaten. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1 Man born of a woman is short of days, and sated with harrowing trouble. 
\v 2 Like a flower he cometh forth, and is cut down: and he fleeth like a shadow, and remaineth not. 
\v 3 And yet on such a one dost thou open thy eyes, and me thou bringest into judgment with thee? 
\v 4 Who can make a clean thing out of an unclean? not one [thing]. 
\v 5 Seeing that his days are determined, the number of his months are [fixed] with thee, that thou hast set his bounds which he cannot pass: 
\v 6 Turn thyself from him that he may recover from his pain, and be able to enjoy like a hired laborer his day. 
\v 7 For there is hope for the tree: if it be cut down, it may still sprout again, while its young shoot will not cease. 
\v 8 If even its root become old in the earth, and its stock die in the dust: 
\v 9 Yet through the scent of water will it flourish [again], and produce boughs as though It were newly planted. 
\v 10 But man dieth, and lieth powerless: yea, the son of earth departeth—and where is he? 
\v 11 The waters run off from the sea, and the river faileth and drieth up: 
\v 12 So doth man lie down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they will not awake, and will not be roused out of their sleep. 
\v 13 Oh who would grant that thou mightest hide me in the nether world, that thou mightest conceal me, until thy wrath be appeased, that thou mightest set for me a fixed time, and remember me then! 
\v 14 Or, when a man dieth, will he live again? all the days of my time of service would I then wait, till [the hour of] my release were come. 
\v 15 Do thou call, and I will truly answer thee: have a desire for the work of thy hands. 
\v 16 Yet now thou numberest my steps: and thou waitest not with [the punishment of] my sin. 
\v 17 Sealed up in a bag is my transgression, and thou yet addest to my iniquity. 
\v 18 But truly a falling mountain will crumble, and [even] a rock is moved out of its place. 
\v 19 The water weareth out stones; thou sweepest away their fragments [like] the dust of the earth: and so thou destroyest the hope of man. 
\v 20 Thou assailest him with might without ceasing, till he passeth away: thou changest his countenance, and sendest him off. 
\v 21 His children acquire honor, but he knoweth it not: and they are esteemed little, but he perceiveth nothing of them. 
\v 22 But his body. on him, feeleth pain, and his soul will mourn for him. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1 Then answered Eliphaz the Themanite, and said, 
\v 2 Should a wise man utter windy knowledge, and fill his inward parts with the east wind? 
\v 3 Should he reason with a speech which availeth nothing? and with words in which there is no profit? 
\v 4 Yea, thou truly makest void the fear [of God], and diminishest devotion before God. 
\v 5 For thy iniquity teacheth thy mouth, so that thou choosest the language of the crafty. 
\v 6 Thy own mouth must condemn thee, but not I: yea, thy own lips will testify against thee. 
\v 7 Wast thou born as the first man? or wast thou brought forth before the hills? 
\v 8 Hast thou listened to the secret counsel of God? and is wisdom therefore of little esteem with thee? 
\v 9 What knowest thou, that we do not know? what understandest thou, which is not with us? 
\v 10 Both the grayheaded and the very aged are among us,— richer than thy father in days. 
\v 11 Are the divine consolations too little for thee? and the word that was so mild with thee? 
\v 12 Whither doth thy heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes gaze at? 
\v 13 That thou shouldst turn against God thy spirit, and utter [such] words out of thy mouth? 
\v 14 What is man, that he should be pure? and that he who is born of woman should be declared righteous? 
\v 15 Behold, in his holy ones he putteth no trust; and the heavens are not pure in his eyes: 
\v 16 How much more then the abominable and corrupt, the man who drinketh like water wrong-doing? 
\v 17 I will instruct thee, hear me; and what I have seen will I relate; 
\v 18 Which wise men have ever told, and have not concealed, as they obtained it from their fathers; 
\v 19 Unto whom alone the earth was given, and into whose midst no stranger ever entered. 
\v 20 All his days is the wicked plagued with pain, and the number of years which are laid by for the tyrant. 
\v 21 A sound of terrors is in his ears: during peace will the waster come over him. 
\v 22 He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is looked for by the sword. 
\v 23 He wandereth abroad for bread, [saying,] Where is it? he knoweth that there is ready at his hand the day of darkness. 
\v 24 Distress and anguish terrify him: they assail him with might, as a king prepared for the battle. 
\v 25 Because he had stretched out against God his hand, and strengthened himself against the Almighty; 
\v 26 [And] he had run against him, with an [extended] neck, with the thick roundings of his bucklers; 
\v 27 Because he had covered his face with his fat, and had made thick folds of fat on his flanks; 
\v 28 And he dwelt in abandoned cities, in houses which none inhabited, which were destined to be ruinous heaps. 
\v 29 [Yet] will he not remain rich, neither will his wealth endure, nor will he attain their perfection on earth. 
\v 30 He will never depart out of darkness: the flame shall dry up his shoots, and he will depart by the breath of God's mouth. 
\v 31 Let him that goeth astray not trust in vanity; for vanity will be what he obtaineth thereby. 
\v 32 Even before his time will it be overfull, and his branches will not be green. 
\v 33 He will shake off like the vine his unripe grapes, and cast off like the olive his blossoms. 
\v 34 For the assembly of hypocrites will remain desolate, and fire will consume the tents of bribery. 
\v 35 They conceive trouble, and bring forth wrong-doing, and their body prepareth deceit. 
\c 16  
\p
\v 1 Then answered Job, and said, 
\v 2 I have heard many things such as these: troublesome comforters are ye all. 
\v 3 Shall there be any end to words of wind? or what compelleth thee that thou shouldst answer? 
\v 4 I also could well speak as ye do: if your soul were but in my soul's stead, I could overwhelm you with words, and could shake my head at you. 
\v 5 But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the condolence of my lips should restrain [your grief]. 
\v 6 Though I were to speak, my pain would not be restrained; and though I should forbear, what will go away from me? 
\v 7 But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company. 
\v 8 And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, they are my witnesses; and my leanness riseth up for me, giveth its testimony to my face. 
\v 9 In his wrath he teareth me to pieces, and assaileth me: he gnasheth over me with his teeth; my adversary sendeth threatening looks at me. 
\v 10 They now open wide against me their mouth; reproachfully they smite my cheek: altogether do they assemble against me. 
\v 11 God hath surrendered me to the unjust, and cast me down into the hands of the wicked. 
\v 12 I was at ease, but he hath crushed me; he hath also grasped me by the neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up unto himself as a mark; 
\v 13 His archers encompass me round about; he cleaveth my reins sunder, and doth not pity; he poureth out upon the ground my gall; 
\v 14 He breaketh me down with breach upon breach; he runneth against me like a mighty man. 
\v 15 Sackcloth have I sewed upon my skin, and my horn I roll in the dust. 
\v 16 My face gloweth from weeping, and on my eyelids resteth the shadow of death: 
\v 17 Not because any violence is in my hands, and while my prayer is pure. 
\v 18 Earth! do thou not cover up my blood, and let no place restrain my cry. 
\v 19 Even now, behold, my witness is in the heavens, and one that testifieth for me is on high. 
\v 20 Are my friends my defenders? unto God my eye poureth out [its tears]. 
\v 21 And oh that a man might plead with God, as one son of earth with the other! 
\v 22 For when the numbered years are passed, then must I travel a path whence I cannot return. 
\c 17  
\p
\v 1 My spirit is broken, my days are cut short, the grave is ready for me. 
\v 2 Yet truly those that mock are with me, and on their offendings must my eye rest. 
\v 3 And thou, [Creator!] attend, I pray thee, be my surety with thyself: who else is there that would strike hands with me? 
\v 4 For thou hast concealed their heart against intelligence: therefore art thou not exalted [through them]. 
\v 5 Every one of them speaketh deceptively to his friends: may also the eyes of his children fail. 
\v 6 And he hath placed me here as a by-word unto nations; and I become openly as a place of abomination. 
\v 7 Therefore is my eye dim from vexation, and my limbs are all of them like a shadow. 
\v 8 Upright men must be astonished at this, and the innocent must arouse himself against the hypocrite. 
\v 9 Yet will the righteous hold firmly on to his way; and he that is clean of hands will acquire additional strength. 
\v 10 But all of you, do only return, and come but [to me]: and yet I shall not find among you one wise man. 
\v 11 My days are past, my resolves are broken off, [even the thoughts]—the possessions of my heart. 
\v 12 These would change the night into day, the light as near in the presence of darkness.— 
\v 13 When I hope for the nether world as my house; in the darkness have I spread my couch; 
\v 14 When I call to corruption, Thou art my father: Thou art my mother, and my sister, to the worms. 
\v 15 Ay, where is then my hope? as for my hope, who will see it [fulfilled]? 
\v 16 Let then my limbs sink down to the nether world: truly in the dust alone there is rest for all. 
\c 18  
\p
\v 1 Then answered Bildad the Shuchite, and said, 
\v 2 When will ye at length put an end to words? Come to an understanding, and afterward let us speak. 
\v 3 For what cause are we counted as beasts, reputed stupid your eyes? 
\v 4 Thou, the one that teareth himself to pieces in his anger— shall for thy sake the earth be forsaken, and the rock be moved away out of its place? 
\v 5 Ah, truly the light of the wicked will be quenched, and the spark of his fire shall not give light. 
\v 6 The light becometh dark in his tent, and his lamp will be quenched above him. 
\v 7 His powerful steps will be narrowed, and his own counsel will cast him down. 
\v 8 For he is driven into the net by his own feet, and he taketh his walk upon a snare. 
\v 9 The trap will seize him by the heel, and the robber will prevail over him. 
\v 10 The cord is hidden for him in the ground, and a trap is set for him on the pathway. 
\v 11 All around do terrors scare him, and chase him as he walketh along. 
\v 12 His first-born will suffer hunger, and calamity will be ready for his wife. 
\v 13 It will devour the limbs of his body: yea, the first-born of death will devour his limbs. 
\v 14 Then will be plucked up out of his tent his confidence, and [the evil] will urge him forward to the king of terrors. 
\v 15 It will dwell in his tent, because it is no more his: there will be strewed sulphur on his habitation. 
\v 16 Beneath, his roots will be dried up, and above will his boughs he cut away. 
\v 17 His resemblance vanisheth from the earth, and no name remaineth for him in the streets. 
\v 18 Men will thrust him out from light into darkness, and out of the world will they drive him. 
\v 19 He will have neither son nor grandson among his people, nor any that escapeth in the places of his sojourning. 
\v 20 Because of his [calamitous] day are they that come after him astonished, and they that went before are seized with shuddering. 
\v 21 Yea, such are the dwellings of the unjust, and this is the place of one that knew not God. 
\c 19  
\p
\v 1 Then answered Job, and said, 
\v 2 How long will ye grieve my soul, and crush me with words? 
\v 3 These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed when ye show yourselves as strangers to me. 
\v 4 Yea, if it be indeed that I have erred, let my error remain with myself. 
\v 5 But if indeed ye wish to magnify yourselves above me, and to prove against me my disgrace: 
\v 6 Then know for certain that God hath bent me down, and hath laid his net all around me. 
\v 7 Behold, I cry out concerning the violence [done me], but I am not answered: I entreat aloud, but there is no justice. 
\v 8 My road hath he fenced up, so that I cannot pass out; and on my paths he placeth darkness. 
\v 9 My glory hath he stripped from me, and removed the crown of my head. 
\v 10 He hath pulled me down on every side, and I am going hence; and he hath rooted up like a tree my hope. 
\v 11 He hath also kindled against me his wrath, and he counteth me with himself as one of his adversaries. 
\v 12 Altogether come on his troops, and make level against me their way, and encamp round about my tent. 
\v 13 My brothers hath he removed far from me, and my acquaintance are entirely estranged from me. 
\v 14 My near of kin have withdrawn, and those befriended by me have forgotten me. 
\v 15 Ye that sojourn in my house, and my maid-servants, regard me as a stranger: an alien am I become in their eyes. 
\v 16 I call for my servant, but he will not answer, though I were to entreat him with my mouth. 
\v 17 My breath is become nauseous to my wife, and my caressing, to the children of my own body. 
\v 18 Yea, children even despise me: I rise up, but they speak against me. 
\v 19 All that have had my confidence abominate me; and those whom I have loved are turned against me. 
\v 20 To my skin and to my flesh my bones do cleave, and I must sustain myself with the gums of my teeth. 
\v 21 Spare me, spare me, O ye, my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me. 
\v 22 Why will ye persecute me as God [hath done], and will never be satisfied with my flesh? 
\v 23 Oh who would but grant, that my words might be written down! oh who would grant that they were entered in a book! 
\v 24 That they were hewn with an iron pen and [blackened with] lead for eternity in the hard rock! 
\v 25 And well I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he will remain as the last after the creatures of the dust [are passed away]; 
\v 26 And after my skin is cut to pieces will this be: and then freed from my body shall I behold God; 
\v 27 Whom I shall myself behold to my happiness, and whom my eyes will see, and not as a stranger, [when even] my reins are consumed within my bosom. 
\v 28 But if ye should say, How will we pursue him? seeing the root of the matter is found in me: 
\v 29 Then have dread for yourselves of the sword; for the wrath [which ye excite] is an iniquity that bringeth the sword; in order that ye may know there is one that judgeth [in the world]. 
\c 20  
\p
\v 1 Then answered Zophar the Na'amathite, and said, 
\v 2 Even therefore do my inmost thoughts give me an answer, and for this reason do I feel a strong excitement within me. 
\v 3 Reproof which casteth shame on me must I hear; yet out of my understanding will the spirit give me an answer. 
\v 4 Dost thou know this? from the very beginning of things, from the very time when man was placed upon earth it was, 
\v 5 That the triumphal shouting of the wicked is ever of but a recent date, and the joy of the hypocrite endureth only for a moment. 
\v 6 Though his exaltation should mount up to the heavens, and his head should reach unto the clouds; 
\v 7 Yet when he but turneth round will he vanish for ever; those who have seen him will say, Where is he? 
\v 8 Like a dream will he fly away, and men will find him no more; yea, he will be chased away like a vision of the night. 
\v 9 If an eye have surveyed him, it will not do so again, and it will not behold him any more in his place. 
\v 10 His children will suffer oppression from the indigent, and his hands will have to restore his [ill-gotten] wealth. 
\v 11 [Now] his bones are full of his youthful vigor; but it will [suddenly] lie down with him in the dust. 
\v 12 If the evil be sweet in his mouth, he will conceal it under his tongue; 
\v 13 He will cherish it, and not forsake it; and hold it back within his palate; 
\v 14 His food is thus changed within his bowels, and becometh the venom of asps within him. 
\v 15 The wealth which he hath swallowed, will he have to vomit up again; God will drive it out of his belly. 
\v 16 The poison of asps will he have to suck; the viper's tongue will slay him. 
\v 17 He shall not look with pleasure on streams, on flowing brooks of honey and cream. 
\v 18 He restoreth what he hath labored for, and will not swallow it down; however much he may have obtained by toil, he will not have any joy of it. 
\v 19 Because he oppressed and forsook the indigent; because he took violently away a house, shall he not rebuild it; 
\v 20 Because he knew not quietness in his bosom, shall he not escape through what is the most precious to him. 
\v 21 Nothing was spared from his craving to eat: therefore shall his wealth not prosper. 
\v 22 In the fulness of his abundance will distress assail him: every hand of [those he] troubled will come against him. 
\v 23 In order to fill his belly, [God] will send out against him the fury of his wrath, and will rain it upon him for his eating. 
\v 24 If he flee from the iron weapon, the brazen bow will strike him through. 
\v 25 He draweth it, and it cometh out of the body; yea, out of his gall the glittering [arrow] cometh forth: over him come the terrors [of death]. 
\v 26 Entire darkness is laid by for his treasures: a fire not urged by blowing will consume him; it will destroy any one that is left in his tent. 
\v 27 The heavens will lay open his iniquity; and the earth will raise herself up against him. 
\v 28 The product of his house will be banished, flowing away on the day of his wrath. 
\v 29 This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and his decreed heritage from God. 
\c 21  
\p
\v 1 Then answered Job, and said, 
\v 2 Hear, O hear my speech, and let this be wherewith you give consolations. 
\v 3 Bear with me that I may indeed speak: and after my speaking, then canst thou mock. 
\v 4 As for me,—is against man my complaint? and if this be so, why should my spirit not be impatient? 
\v 5 Turn yourselves unto me, and be astounded, and lay your hand upon your mouth. 
\v 6 Yea, when I think of it, I am terrified, and shuddering seizeth hold of my flesh. 
\v 7 Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, grow strong in power? 
\v 8 Their seed is firmly established in their presence with them. their offspring are before their eyes. 
\v 9 Their houses are at peace without any dread, and no rod of God [cometh] over them. 
\v 10 The bull of each one gendereth, and disappointeth not: the cow of each one calveth, and casteth not her young. 
\v 11 They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children skip about [with joy]. 
\v 12 They sing to the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the pipe. 
\v 13 They wear out their days in happiness, and in a moment they go down to the nether world. 
\v 14 And yet they say unto God, “Depart from us; and the knowledge of thy ways we desire not. 
\v 15 What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit shall we have, if we entreat him urgently?” 
\v 16 Lo, not in their hand doth their happiness rest! The counsel of the wicked be [still] far from me. 
\v 17 How often is the lamp of the wicked quenched? and how often cometh over them their calamity? and doth [God] distribute their lot in his anger? 
\v 18 Are they as straw before the wind, and as chaff which the stealeth away? 
\v 19 Should God lay up for his children his wrong-doing? it were better that he reward him, that he might know it himself. 
\v 20 His own eyes ought to see his downfall, and from the wrath of the Almighty ought he to drink. 
\v 21 For what care hath he for his household after him, when the number of his months is all apportioned to him? 
\v 22 Is this fitting God, who teacheth knowledge? him who judgeth those that are highest? 
\v 23 That this one dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet; 
\v 24 His vessels being full of healthy fluid, and the marrow of his bones being well moistened: 
\v 25 While this other dieth with an embittered soul, and hath never partaken of any happiness; 
\v 26 [And yet] together they must lie down in the dust, and the worms will cover them? 
\v 27 Behold, I know your thoughts, and the opinions which ye wrongfully devise against me. 
\v 28 For ye say, Where is the house of the noble-minded? and where is the tent of the dwelling-places of the wicked? 
\v 29 Have ye not asked the wayfarers? surely their token ye cannot disregard, 
\v 30 That the bad man is reserved for the day of calamity, [that the wicked] are carried forward to the day of wrath. 
\v 31 [But] who will tell him to his face of his way? and who will repay him what he hath done? 
\v 32 Yea he will indeed be carried to the grave, and men will quickly think of his monument: 
\v 33 Sweet are to him the clods of the valley; and after him succeedeth every man, as those that were before him are without number. 
\v 34 How then will ye comfort me with vanity? and of your answers there remaineth only deception. 
\c 22  
\p
\v 1 Then answered Eliphaz the Themanite, and said, 
\v 2 Can a man be serviceable unto God? Truly the intelligent is serviceable unto himself. 
\v 3 Is it any pleasure to the Almighty that thou art righteous? or is it any gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect? 
\v 4 Is it out of fear of thee that he will reproach thee? or go with thee into judgment? 
\v 5 Is not thy evil great? and no end to thy iniquities? 
\v 6 For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brothers for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing. 
\v 7 Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and from the hungry thou hast withholden bread. 
\v 8 But as for the man of a strong arm, he obtained the land, and the highly honored could dwell therein. 
\v 9 Widows hast thou sent away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken. 
\v 10 Therefore are snares round about thee, and sudden dread terrifieth thee. 
\v 11 Or seest thou not the darkness? and the abundance of water which covereth thee? 
\v 12 Is not God in the height of heaven? and beholding the highest elevation of the stars, however high they are? 
\v 13 But thou sayest, “What doth God know? can he judge behind the darkness? 
\v 14 Thick clouds are a covering for him, so that he will not see; and he walketh along on the circle of heaven.” 
\v 15 Wilt thou [thus] observe the path of ancient times which the men of injustice have trodden? 
\v 16 Who were shrivelled up before their time, whose foundation was flooded away like a river; 
\v 17 Who said unto God, “'Depart from us:” and what wrought the Almighty for them? 
\v 18 And yet it was he that filled their houses with good things; but the counsel of the wicked be [still] far from me. 
\v 19 The righteous will see it, and be glad; and the innocent will laugh them to scorn. 
\v 20 “Is not he destroyed that rose up against us, and hath not the fire consumed what they had left?” 
\v 21 Do but become acquainted with him, and be at peace: thereby will happiness come unto thee. 
\v 22 Do but accept instruction from his mouth, and lay up his saying in thy heart. 
\v 23 If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, so thou wilt but remove wrong-doing far away from thy tents. 
\v 24 And throw down in the dust precious metals, and [the gold of] Ophir to the stones of the brooks: 
\v 25 Then will the Almighty be thy precious metal, and brightly-shining silver unto thee. 
\v 26 For then wilt thou have in the Almighty thy delight, and thou canst lift up unto God thy face. 
\v 27 Thou wilt make entreaty unto him, and he will hear thee, and thy vows wilt thou pay. 
\v 28 And if thou decree a thing, it will be fulfilled unto thee; and upon thy ways the light will shine. 
\v 29 For when men are brought low, thou wilt say, Pride [hath done it]; but those of lowly eyes [God] will help. 
\v 30 He will even deliver him who is not guiltless: and thou wilt be delivered by the purity of thy hands. 
\c 23  
\p
\v 1 Then answered Job, and said, 
\v 2 Even now is my complaint bitter: my suffering is heavier than my groans. 
\v 3 Oh who would grant that I knew where I might find him! that I might attain to his Judgment throne! 
\v 4 I would put in order before him my cause, and my mouth would I fill with arguments. 
\v 5 I should know the words which he might answer me, and understand what he might say unto me. 
\v 6 Would he with his power contend against me? he would truly not lay such doings to my charge. 
\v 7 There would an upright one argue with him; and I should be allowed to escape for ever by my judge. 
\v 8 But, lo, I go eastward—and he is not there; and to the west— and I cannot perceive him; 
\v 9 When he doth great things at the north, I behold him not; he hideth himself in the south—and I see him not. 
\v 10 But he knoweth the way that I take: were he to probe me, I should come forth as gold. 
\v 11 On his steps my foot hath held fast: his way have I kept, and swerved not. 
\v 12 From the commandment of his lips have I also not moved away: as a fixed statute for me have I treasured up the sayings of his mouth. 
\v 13 But he is unchangeably one, and who can turn him? And what his will desireth, even that he doth. 
\v 14 For he will bring to completion what hath been destined for me: and like these hath he many other things with him. 
\v 15 Therefore am I terrified at his presence: I will reflect, and be in dread of him. 
\v 16 Still God hath made timid my heart, and the Almighty hath terrified me; 
\v 17 Because I was not destroyed before this darkness, and because he hath not hidden from my face [this] gloom. 
\c 24  
\p
\v 1 Why are not times [of punishment] treasured up by the Almighty, and why do his adorers not see his days [of retribution]? 
\v 2 [The wicked] remove landmarks: they rob flocks, and feed them. 
\v 3 They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take in pledge the widow's ox. 
\v 4 They chase the needy out of the highway: altogether hide themselves the poor of the earth. 
\v 5 Behold, as wild asses in the wilderness go they forth to their work, rising betimes after [their] prey: the desert yieldeth food for them and for their young men. 
\v 6 In the field they reap their food; and in the vineyard of the wicked they gather the fruit. 
\v 7 They cause [the poor] to spend the night naked, without clothing and without any covering in the cold. 
\v 8 Through the sweeping rain of the mountains are they made wet, and for want of a shelter do they embrace the rock. 
\v 9 The others pluck from the breast the fatherless, and the garment of the poor they take in pledge. 
\v 10 They cause him to go naked without clothing, and from the hungry they take away the sheaf: 
\v 11 Within their walls do they make oil, they tread their wine-presses, and suffer thirst. 
\v 12 Out of a populous city is groaning heard, and the soul of the deadly wounded crieth out: yet God regardeth it not as an offence. 
\v 13 Yon men are of those that rebel against the light: they know not its ways, nor abide in its paths. 
\v 14 With the earliest light riseth the murderer, he slayeth the poor and needy, and in the night he becometh like the thief. 
\v 15 And the eye of the adulterer watcheth for the twilight, saying, No eye will see me; and placeth a covering on his face. 
\v 16 They break into houses in the dark, in the daytime they lock themselves in: they know not the light. 
\v 17 For to all of these alike is the morning as the shadow of death; for they are familiar with the terrors of the shadow of death. 
\v 18 Swift are such men [to flee] on the face of the water; accursed is their field on the land; none of them turneth himself to the way, of the vineyards. 
\v 19 Drought and heat speedily consume the snow-waters: so doth the grave those who have sinned. 
\v 20 The mother that bore such a one will forget him; the worm will feed sweetly on him; he will be no more remembered; and like a tree will wickedness be broken. 
\v 21 He ill-treateth the barren that heareth not; and to the widow he acteth not well. 
\v 22 But he also draweth down the mighty with his power: he riseth up, no one is sure of life. 
\v 23 To such [God] granteth to be in safety, that he may find support; and His eyes are upon their ways. 
\v 24 They are exalted; in but a little while they are no more; and they are brought down low: like all others are they gathered in, and like the top of the ear of corn are they cut off. 
\v 25 But if it be not so, who will prove me a liar, and render nought my word? 
\c 25  
\p
\v 1 Then answered Bildad the Shuchite, and said, 
\v 2 Dominion and dread are with him: he maketh peace in high places. 
\v 3 Can the number of his hosts be given? and over whom riseth not his light? 
\v 4 How then can man be justified with God? or how can be one that is born of woman? 
\v 5 Behold, even as regardeth the moon, that is not bright; yea, the stars are not pure in his eyes. 
\v 6 How much less the mortal, the mere worm? and the son of earth, the mere maggot? 
\c 26  
\p
\v 1 Then answered Job, and said, 
\v 2 What assistance hast thou given to the powerless? [how] hast thou helped the arm without strength? 
\v 3 How hast thou counselled the unwise? and what sound wisdom hast thou made known so plentifully? 
\v 4 To whom hast thou told words? and whose spirit came from thee? 
\v 5 The departed are called into being beneath the waters, and their inhabitants. 
\v 6 Naked is the nether world before him, and there is no covering for the place of corruption. 
\v 7 He stretched out the north over empty space; he suspended the earth on nothing; 
\v 8 He bound up the waters in his clouds; and the cloud bursteth not under their weight; 
\v 9 He closed up the surface of his throne, spreading over it his cloud; 
\v 10 A fixed limit he compassed off over the face of the waters, for the division of the light and darkness. 
\v 11 The pillars of heaven tremble greatly, and are astounded at his rebuke. 
\v 12 By his power he split in pieces the sea, and by his understanding he crushed [its] pride: 
\v 13 By his breath the heavens [acquired] beauty; his hand hath created the flying serpent. 
\v 14 Lo, these are ends of his ways; for how slight a whisper is heard [by us] of him! but the thunder of his mighty deeds who can understand? 
\c 27  
\p
\v 1 And Job continued taking up his parable, and said, 
\v 2 As God liveth, who hath removed justice from me; and by the Almighty, who hath embittered my soul: 
\v 3 All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils; 
\v 4 Shall my lips not speak any wrong, nor shall my tongue utter deceit. 
\v 5 Far be it from me that I should justify you; till I depart hence will I not allow [any one] to take my integrity away from me. 
\v 6 I have laid fast hold on my righteousness, and I will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach me [for my conduct] during all my life. 
\v 7 Like the wicked is [therefore] my enemy, and he that riseth up against me like a wrong-doer. 
\v 8 For what is the hope of the hypocrite, when he hath gained unjust wealth, when God casteth forth his soul? 
\v 9 Will God hear his cry, when distress cometh upon him? 
\v 10 Or can he find delight in the Almighty? can he call on God at all times? 
\v 11 I will instruct you concerning what is in the hand of God: [the way] which is with the Almighty will I not conceal. 
\v 12 Lo! ye yourselves have all beheld it: why is it then that ye deal in such vanities? 
\v 13 This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the portion of tyrants, which they shall receive from the Almighty. 
\v 14 If his children be multiplied, it is only for the sword; and his offspring will not be satisfied with bread. 
\v 15 Those of his that are left to escape will be buried by death; and his widows will not be able to weep. 
\v 16 Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare garments [as plentifully] as the clay: 
\v 17 He may prepare, but the righteous will clothe himself [therewith], and the silver the innocent will divide. 
\v 18 He buildeth his house like the moth, and like a hut that a keeper hath made. 
\v 19 Rich will he lie down, but will not be gathered [into the grave]: one openeth his eyes, and he is no more. 
\v 20 Like a flood will terror overtake him, in the night a tempest will steal him away. 
\v 21 The east wind will lift him up, and he must be gone; and it hurleth him like a storm out of his place. 
\v 22 And [God] will cast [evil] upon him, and bare no pity: out of his hand [his wealth] will surely escape. 
\v 23 Men will clap their hands over him, and will hiss after him out of his place. 
\c 28  
\p
\v 1 For truly there is a source for the silver, and a place for the gold which men refine. 
\v 2 Iron is taken out of the dust, and the stone is melted into copper. 
\v 3 An end doth he set to darkness, and the very utmost limit doth he search out, the stones of darkness, and of the shadow of death. 
\v 4 He breaketh a channel far from the inhabited place; those of unsteady foot, the poorest of men move [there about]. 
\v 5 The earth, out of which cometh forth bread, is under its surface turned up as it were with fire. 
\v 6 Her stones are the place whence the sapphire cometh; and golden dust is also there; 
\v 7 [On the] path which no bird of prey knoweth, and which the vulture's eye hath not surveyed; 
\v 8 [Which] ravenous beasts have never trodden, over which the lion hath never passed. 
\v 9 To the flinty rock he stretcheth forth his hand; he overturneth the mountains from the root. 
\v 10 Amid rocks he heweth out canals: and every precious thing doth his eye behold. 
\v 11 The various droppings of water he uniteth into streams, and what is hidden he bringeth forth to light. 
\v 12 But wisdom—where shall she he found? and where is the place of understanding? 
\v 13 Man knoweth not her value: and she is not to be found in the land of the living. 
\v 14 The deep saith, Not in me is she: and the sea saith, She is not with me. 
\v 15 No fine gold can be given in lieu of her, and silver cannot be weighed out as her price. 
\v 16 She cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire. 
\v 17 She cannot be estimated after gold and glass; and not in exchange for her [can] vessels of refined gold [be taken.] 
\v 18 Coral and crystal will not be thought of; and the value of wisdom is above pearls. 
\v 19 She cannot be estimated after the topaz of Ethiopia, nor can she be valued with pure gold. 
\v 20 But wisdom—whence cometh she? and where is the place of understanding? 
\v 21 Yea, she is hidden from the eyes of all living, and from the fowls of the heavens is she concealed. 
\v 22 Perdition and death say, With our ears have we heard a report of her. 
\v 23 God [alone] understandeth her way, and he knoweth her place; 
\v 24 For he looketh to the ends of the earth, [whatever is] under the whole heaven doth he see. 
\v 25 When he imparted weight unto the wind; and [when] the waters he established by measure; 
\v 26 When he made a law for the rain, and a way for the lightning of [his] thunders; 
\v 27 Then did he see her, and make her known; he established her, and also searched her out. 
\v 28 And he said unto man, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to eschew evil is understanding. 
\c 29  
\p
\v 1 And Job continued to take up his parable, and said, 
\v 2 Who will give me back months like those which are past, days like those when God guarded me; 
\v 3 When his lamp shone over my head, when by his light I could walk in darkness; 
\v 4 As I was in the days of my abundance, when the confidence of God was upon my tent: 
\v 5 When the Almighty was yet with me, when my servants stood round about me; 
\v 6 When I bathed my steps in cream, and the rock poured out near me streamlets of oil! 
\v 7 When I went out to the gate close by the city, when in the open place I established my seat: 
\v 8 Young men saw me, and hid themselves; and the aged rose up, and remained standing; 
\v 9 Princes stopped in the midst of [their] words, and laid their hand on their mouth: 
\v 10 The voice of nobles was arrested, and their tongue cleaved to their palate. 
\v 11 For the ear that heard me called me happy; and the eye that saw me bore witness for me; 
\v 12 Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, yea, that had none to help him. 
\v 13 The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me; and the heart of the widow I caused to sing for joy. 
\v 14 I took righteousness as my garment, and it clothed me: as a robe and a mitre was justice unto me. 
\v 15 Eyes was I to the blind; and feet to the lame was I. 
\v 16 A father was I to the needy; and the cause of him I knew not I used to investigate. 
\v 17 And I broke the cutting-teeth of the wrong-doer, and out of his teeth I cast down his prey. 
\v 18 And I said then, “In the midst of my nest shall I depart hence, and like the sand shall I have many days. 
\v 19 My root will stand open for the water, and the dew will lodge on my boughs. 
\v 20 My glory will ever be new with me, and my bow will acquire fresh strength in my hand.” 
\v 21 Unto me men listened, and waited, and watched in silence for my counsel 
\v 22 After my words they made no reply, and my speech dropped on them [like dew]. 
\v 23 And they waited for me as for the rain, and they opened wide their mouth as for the latter rain. 
\v 24 I smiled on those that had lost their confidence; and the light of my countenance they never cast down. 
\v 25 I chose their way for them, and I sat as chief, and dwelt as king in his army, as one that comforteth mourners. 
\c 30  
\p
\v 1 But now they who are younger than I in years laugh at me, whose fathers I scorned to put as equals with the dogs of my flocks. 
\v 2 Yea, what possible use can the strength of their hands be unto me, over whom old age hath passed fruitlessly? 
\v 3 Who suffer for want and famine in solitude; who flee into the wilderness [where all is] darkness, ruin, and desolation; 
\v 4 Who crop off mallows by the bushes, and have broom-bush roots as their bread; 
\v 5 Who are driven forth from among [men], who are shouted after as though they were thieves, 
\v 6 To dwell in the caverns of the valleys, in holes of the earth, and on naked cliffs. 
\v 7 Among the bushes they shriek; under briers they are huddled together, 
\v 8 The children of the worthless, yea, the children of the nameless, who were outcasts from the land. 
\v 9 But now I am become their song, and I am become a byword unto them. 
\v 10 They loathe me, they keep themselves far from me, and from my face they withhold not their spittle. 
\v 11 Because he hath loosened the cord of my bow, and afflicted me, they have also cast off the bridle before me. 
\v 12 Against my right hand rise up this swarm of worthless youths: they push away my feet, and they level against me their calamity-bringing paths. 
\v 13 They destroy my footpath, they help forward my downfall, without any one to aid them. 
\v 14 As [through] a broad breach they come: amidst a loud noise they rolled themselves along. 
\v 15 Terrors have turned their face against me; they chase like the wind my glory: and like a cloud is my happiness passed away. 
\v 16 And now my soul is poured out over me; the days of affliction have seized on me; 
\v 17 All night it holloweth out my bones out of my body; and my pursuers take no rest. 
\v 18 Through the Almlghty's power is my garment made unknown: like the opening of my coat hath he enclosed me. 
\v 19 He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes. 
\v 20 I cry aloud unto thee, but thou answerest me not: I stand up, and thou fixest thy regard against me. 
\v 21 Thou art changed into a cruel master toward me: with the strength of thy hand thou assailest me. 
\v 22 Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to pass away, and dissolvest in me all wise counsel. 
\v 23 For I know that thou wilt bring me back to death, and to the house of assembly for all the living. 
\v 24 But doth not a man stretch out his hand among ruins? or doth one not cry out therefrom [for help] when he meeteth his downfall? 
\v 25 Did I not weep for him that was hard pressed by misfortune? was not my soul grieved for the needy? 
\v 26 That I hoped for good, but there came evil; and I waited for light, and there came darkness! 
\v 27 My bowels heave, and rest not: the days of affliction have overcome me. 
\v 28 I walk about mournfully without sunlight: when I rise up, in the assembly, I cry with pain. 
\v 29 I am a brother to [howling] monsters, and a companion to ostriches. 
\v 30 My skin hangeth down black from me, and my bones are burnt from heat. 
\v 31 And thus is changed to mourning my harp, and my pipe to the sound of weeping. 
\c 31  
\p
\v 1 A covenant had I made with my eyes: how then should I fix my look on a virgin? 
\v 2 And what then would have been my portion of God from above? and what lot of the Almighty from on high? 
\v 3 Is not calamity [ready] for the unjust? and misfortune for the wrong-doers? 
\v 4 Behold, he truly seeth my ways, and numbereth all my steps; 
\v 5 [And knoweth] whether I have walked with vain desires, or if my foot hath hastened after deceit. 
\v 6 Let him weigh me then in a righteous balance, and let God acknowledge my integrity, 
\v 7 If my step have turned aside from the [proper] way, and my heart have walked after my eyes, and if any blemish have cleaved to my hands: 
\v 8 Then let me sow, and let another eat; and let what I have growing be rooted out. 
\v 9 If my heart have been beguiled toward a woman, or if I have lain in wait at my neighbor's door: 
\v 10 Then may my wife labor at the mill for another, and may strangers ill-use her; 
\v 11 For this would be incest; yea, it would be an iniquity [to be punished by] the judges; 
\v 12 For it would be a fire that consumeth down to the place of corruption, and would root out all my products. 
\v 13 If ever I cast aside the justice due to my man-servant and my maid-servant, when they contended with me: 
\v 14 What then could I do when God should rise up? and when he should investigate, what could I answer him? 
\v 15 Did not he that made me make him born or a woman? and did not the same one fashion us in the womb? 
\v 16 If ever I denied the wish of the indigent, or ever allowed the eyes of the widow to fall [in vain hopes]; 
\v 17 Or if ever I ate my bread by myself alone, and the fatherless did not eat thereof; 
\v 18 (For from my youth he was brought up with me, as though we were of one father, and I have guided her [as though she was sprung] from my mother's womb;) 
\v 19 If ever I saw any one perishing for want of clothing, or the needy without covering: 
\v 20 If his loins have not blessed me, and if he have not been warmed with the fleece of my sheep; 
\v 21 If I have swung my hand against the fatherless, because I saw in the gate those that would help me: 
\v 22 Then may my shoulder fall from my shoulder-blade, and my arm be broken from the channel-bone; 
\v 23 For dreaded by me was the calamitous punishment of God, and against his highness I can accomplish nothing. 
\v 24 If I have made gold my confidence, or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my trust: 
\v 25 If ever I rejoiced because my wealth was abundant, and because my hand had gotten much; 
\v 26 If ever I looked at the light [of the sun] when he shone brightly and on the moon walking in splendor: 
\v 27 And my heart became misled in secret, and my hand kissed my mouth: 
\v 28 This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge; for thus would I have denied the God that is above. 
\v 29 If ever I rejoiced at the downfall of him that hated me, or was elated when evil befell him;— 
\v 30 But I suffered not my mouth to sin by denouncing with a curse his soul:— 
\v 31 If the men of my tent said not, Oh is there one that is not satisfied of his flesh;— 
\v 32 In the street a stranger had not to lodge; my doors I held open to the roadside; 
\v 33 If I covered up my transgressions like a common man, by hiding in my bosom my iniquity; 
\v 34 Because I dreaded the great multitude, or because the contempt of families did terrify me, so that I kept silence, and dared not to go out of the door;— 
\v 35 Oh who will bring me one that would hear me! behold, here is my plea; may the Almighty answer me; and any record which my opponent may have written,— 
\v 36 Surely upon my shoulder would I carry it: I would bind it as a crown unto me. 
\v 37 The number of my steps would I tell him: as [to] a prince would I go near unto him.— 
\v 38 If my land ever cried out because of me, or if its furrows wept together; 
\v 39 If I ever consumed its strength without payment, or caused the soul of its owners to grieve: 
\v 40 Then may instead of wheat, thorns come forth, and instead of barley, cockle. (Here end the words of Job.) 
\c 32  
\p
\v 1 So had these three men abstained from answering Job; because he was righteous in his own eyes. 
\v 2 Thereupon was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he had declared himself more righteous than God. 
\v 3 And against his three friends was his wrath kindled; because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job. 
\v 4 Now Elihu had held back toward Job [his] words; because the others were older in days than he. 
\v 5 But when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then was his wrath kindled. 
\v 6 And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite commenced, and said, Young am I in days, and ye are very old: therefore I hesitated and feared to show you what I know. 
\v 7 I had said, Days shall speak, and multitude of years shall make wisdom known. 
\v 8 But it is the spirit in man, and the breath of the Almighty which giveth them understanding. 
\v 9 Not those rich in years must be always wise: neither do the aged constantly understand what is just. 
\v 10 Therefore do I say, Hearken to me: I also will show forth what I know myself. 
\v 11 Behold, I waited for your words: I gave an attentive ear to your reasonings, till you might have searched out the [proper] words. 
\v 12 And now I understand you fully, and, behold, there is none that convinceth Job, or, that answereth his speeches among you. 
\v 13 Say then not, We have found wisdom: God will thrust him down, not man. 
\v 14 But he hath not directed any words against me: and with your speeches will I not answer him. 
\v 15 They are dismayed, they answer no more: words have escaped away from them. 
\v 16 And should I wait [longer], because they cannot speak, because they stand stilt and answer no more? 
\v 17 [But] I also will surely answer my part, I myself also will show forth what I know; 
\v 18 For I am full of words, the spirit in my bosom urgeth me hard. 
\v 19 Behold, my bosom is like [fresh] wine which hath not been opened: like new bottles it is ready to burst. 
\v 20 I will speak, that I may breathe freer: I will open my lips and answer. 
\v 21 On no account will I show undue favor to any man, and to no son of earth will I give flattering titles. 
\v 22 For I know not to give flattering titles; [for else] my Maker would speedily carry me away. 
\c 33  
\p
\v 1 Therefore do thou but hear, O Job, my speeches, and give ear to all my words. 
\v 2 Behold now, I have opened my mouth, my tongue speaketh in my mouth. 
\v 3 Out of my straightforward heart [come] my sayings, and my lips utter knowledge clearly. 
\v 4 The spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty giveth me life. 
\v 5 If thou canst, answer me, array thyself before me, stand forward. 
\v 6 Behold, I am in the same relation as thyself toward God: I myself also am cut out of the clay. 
\v 7 Behold, dread of me cannot terrify thee, and my pressure will not be too heavy upon thee. 
\v 8 But thou hast said before my ears, and the sound of the words I still hear, 
\v 9 “I am pure without transgression, I am quite clean; and there is no iniquity in me: 
\v 10 Yet, behold, he findeth hateful backsliding on me, he regardeth me as an enemy unto him; 
\v 11 He putteth my feet in the stocks, he watcheth all my paths.” 
\v 12 Behold, In this thou art not just: I will answer thee; for God is far greater than a mortal. 
\v 13 Why dost thou contend against him? for with all his words will he not give an answer. 
\v 14 For God speaketh once, yea twice: [yet man] regardeth it not. 
\v 15 In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumbers upon the couch: 
\v 16 Then doth he lay open the ear of men, and sealeth it with their warning; 
\v 17 To remove the son of earth [from his intended] deed and he covereth up pride from man; 
\v 18 He withholdeth his soul from the pit, and his life from passing away by the sword. 
\v 19 And so is he admonished by pain upon his couch, and all his bones with violent [aches]. 
\v 20 So that his inclination abhorreth bread, and his soul, the most agreeable food. 
\v 21 His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen, and his bones that were not seen stick out. 
\v 22 Yea, his soul draweth near unto the pit, and his life to those that slay. 
\v 23 If there be now about him one single angel, as defender, one out of a thousand, to tell for man his uprightness: 
\v 24 Then is he gracious unto him, and saith, Release him from going down to the pit, I have found an atonement. 
\v 25 His flesh becometh full again as in youth: he returneth to the days of his boyhood. 
\v 26 He will offer his entreaty unto God, and he will receive him in favor, that he may see his face with joy: so doth He recompense unto the mortal his righteousness. 
\v 27 He then should assemble men around, and say, “I had sinned, and perverted what is right, yet have I not received a like return.” 
\v 28 Thus he redeemeth his soul from passing into the pit, and his life will look joyously on the light. 
\v 29 Lo, all these things doth God two or three times with man; 
\v 30 To bring back his soul from the pit, that she may shine in the light of life. 
\v 31 Listen well, O Job, hearken unto me: keep silence, and I will truly speak. 
\v 32 If thou hast any words, answer me: speak, for I wish to justify thee. 
\v 33 If not, hearken thou unto me: keep silence, and I will teach thee wisdom. 
\c 34  
\p
\v 1 And Elihu commenced, and said, 
\v 2 Hear, O ye wise men, my words; and ye that have knowledge, give ear unto me. 
\v 3 For the ear proveth words, as the palate tasteth the food. 
\v 4 Let us choose for ourselves what is just: let us acknowledge between ourselves what is good. 
\v 5 For Job hath said, “I am righteous; and God hath taken away justice from me. 
\v 6 Should I lie concerning the justice due me? incurable is [my wound from] the arrow I bear in me without any transgression.” 
\v 7 What man is there like Job, who drinketh scorning like water, 
\v 8 And is on the road to keep company with the wrong-doers, and to walk with men of wickedness? 
\v 9 For he hath said, “It profiteth a man nothing when he acteth according to the pleasure of God.” 
\v 10 Therefore ye men of sense hearken unto me: far is it from God to practise wickedness; and from the Almighty to do wrong! 
\v 11 For the work of a son of earth doth he recompense unto him, and according to the path of man doth he permit things to occur to him. 
\v 12 Yea, surely God will not condemn unjustly, nor will the Almighty pervert justice. 
\v 13 Who hath given him a charge concerning the earth? or who hath intrusted [him] the whole world? 
\v 14 If he were to set his heart upon man, he would gather unto himself his spirit and his breath: 
\v 15 All flesh would perish together, and the son of earth would return again unto dust. 
\v 16 If then thou wishest to understand, hear this: give ear to the sound of my words. 
\v 17 Is it possible that he who hateth justice should govern? or wilt thou condemn the righteous mighty One? 
\v 18 [Is it fit] to say to a king, Thou art worthless? and to princes, Ye are wicked? 
\v 19 Whereas he is one that showeth no favor to chieftains, and distinguisheth not the rich before the indigent; for all of them are the work of his hands. 
\v 20 In a moment will they die, and in the midst of the night; people are moved, and pass away: and the mighty will be removed without a human hand. 
\v 21 For big eyes are upon the ways of man, and all his steps doth he see. 
\v 22 There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the evil-doers can hide themselves. 
\v 23 For he need not direct [his attention] a long time upon man, that he should enter into judgment before God. 
\v 24 He breaketh down mighty men without [long] searching, and placeth others in their stead. 
\v 25 For the reason that he knoweth their deeds: therefore he overturneth them in the night, and they are crushed. 
\v 26 Among wicked men doth he strike them, in the place where [many] see them: 
\v 27 Because they have departed from following him, and have not considered all his ways. 
\v 28 Bringing before them the cry of the indigent, and the cry of the afflicted which he had to hear. 
\v 29 When he now granteth rest, who will condemn [him]! and when he hideth his face, who can behold him? whether it be against a nation, or against one man, it is the same: 
\v 30 That no hypocritical man may reign, that such shall not be a mare to the people. 
\v 31 For truly it is only fitting to say unto God, “I bear [cheerfully], I will not do any wrong; 
\v 32 What I cannot see myself, do thou truly teach me; if I have done what is unjust, I will do so no more.” 
\v 33 Should he then according to thy view send a recompense, because thou hast rejected him? “Because thou must choose, and not I?” and what thou knowest, do speak. 
\v 34 Men of sense will say unto me, and every wise man who heareth me, 
\v 35 That Job hath not spoken with knowledge, and that his words are without intelligence. 
\v 36 Oh that Job may therefore be probed continually, in order to give answers against sinful men. 
\v 37 For he addeth unto his sin transgression: among us he uttereth too many loud words, and multiplieth his speeches against God. 
\c 35  
\p
\v 1 Then commenced Elihu, and said, 
\v 2 Dost thou deem this to be just, that thou hast said, “My righteousness is more than God's?” 
\v 3 For thou sayest, “What benefit will it be unto thee? what more profit shall I have, than if I had sinned?” 
\v 4 I will truly reply unto thee with words, and unto thy friends with thee. 
\v 5 Look unto the heavens, and see; and gaze on the skies which are higher than thou. 
\v 6 If thou sin, what dost thou effect against him? and if thy transgressions be multiplied, what canst thou do unto him? 
\v 7 If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what doth he accept out of thy hand? 
\v 8 A man like thyself thy wickedness may reach, and a son of earth thy righteousness. 
\v 9 By reason of the multitude of oppressions [the wicked] cause men to cry: these complain aloud because of the arm of the mighty. 
\v 10 But [man] saith not, Where is God my maker, who bestoweth joyful songs even in the night; 
\v 11 Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of the heavens? 
\v 12 There do they cry, but he answereth not: because of the pride of evil men. 
\v 13 Only what is false will God not hear, nor will the Almighty regard it. 
\v 14 Although thou sayest, thou canst not see him: yet the decision is before him; and do thou wait for him. 
\v 15 But now, because his anger hath punished nothing, shall he not greatly take cognizance of the multitude of sins? 
\v 16 But Job openeth wide his mouth for nought: without knowledge he heapeth up words. 
\c 36  
\p
\v 1 Then continued Elihu, and said, 
\v 2 Wait for me a little, and I will instruct thee; for [I have] still some words on God's behalf. 
\v 3 I will lift up my knowledge for him who is afar, and for my Maker will I obtain righteousness. 
\v 4 For truly no falsehood is [in] my words: one that is upright in [his] opinions [dealeth now] with thee. 
\v 5 Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength of intellect. 
\v 6 He permitteth not the wicked to live; but he procureth justice for the afflicted. 
\v 7 He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous; but [he placeth them] with kings on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted. 
\v 8 And if they be bound in fetters, and if they be entangled in the cords of affliction: 
\v 9 Then doth he tell them of their work, and of their transgressions, when they had become strong. 
\v 10 And he openeth thus their ear to correction, and saith that they should return from wrong-doing. 
\v 11 If they hearken and serve [him], they will spend their days in happiness, and their years in pleasures. 
\v 12 But if they hearken not, they will pass away through the sword, and they will perish in want of knowledge. 
\v 13 But the hypocrites in heart persevere in wrath; they will not offer entreaty when he bindeth them: 
\v 14 Their soul will die in youth, and their life, among the incestuous. 
\v 15 He delivereth the afflicted through his affliction, and openeth through oppression his ear. 
\v 16 And also thee hath he incited away from the jaws of distress into a wide space, on the site of which there is no straitness; and what is set on thy table is full of fatness. 
\v 17 But if thou art full of the judgment of the wicked: [divine] judgment and decree will support each other. 
\v 18 For there would be fury, If aught were to incite thee to utter an abundance [of rebellious words]; and the greatness of the infliction must not mislead thee. 
\v 19 Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold ore, nor all the highest forces of strength. 
\v 20 Desire then not eagerly the night, when nations pass away in their place. 
\v 21 Take heed, turn not thyself to wrong-doing, so that thou wouldst choose this because of [thy] affliction. 
\v 22 Behold, God is exalted by his power: who is an instructer like him? 
\v 23 Who hath given him a charge concerning his way? or who hath ever said, Thou hast acted unjustly? 
\v 24 Reflect, that thou shouldst magnify his work, which [other] men have beheld. 
\v 25 All men have looked at it [with astonishment]; the mortal gazeth at it from afar. 
\v 26 Behold, God is great, and we comprehend him not, the number of his years can truly not be searched out. 
\v 27 For he taketh away drops of water, which are purified into rain in his mist: 
\v 28 These drop down out of the skies; they distil upon the multitude of men. 
\v 29 But [what man] can understand the outspreadings of the clouds? the tumult of his tabernacle? 
\v 30 Behold, he spreadeth out over it his light, and covereth up the roots of the sea. 
\v 31 For by means of them he judgeth nations, he giveth food in superfluity. 
\v 32 [His] hands he covereth with light; and he commandeth it to strike the one who striveth against him. 
\v 33 The noise of his storm telleth of it, yea, the cattle also, of the rising tempest. 
\c 37  
\p
\v 1 At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved upward out of its place. 
\v 2 Hear, O hear, the rattling of his thunder, and the storm's roar that goeth out of his mouth. 
\v 3 Under the whole heavens he letteth it loose, and his lightning over the ends of the earth. 
\v 4 Behind it roareth the thunder; he thundereth with his majestic voice; and he holdeth them not back when his voice is heard. 
\v 5 God thundereth with his marvelous voice: he doth great things, which we cannot comprehend. 
\v 6 For to the snow he saith, Be thou on the earth: likewise the pouring rain, and to the pouring rains of his strength. 
\v 7 He sealeth it on the hand of every man, that all men whom he hath made may know it. 
\v 8 Then retire the beasts into [their] dens, and rest in their lairs. 
\v 9 Out of [his] chamber cometh the whirlwind, and out of the north, the cold. 
\v 10 From the breathing of God ice is given, and the broad waters become solid. 
\v 11 Also with moisture he loadeth the cloud; [and] he scattereth the cloud of his lightning; 
\v 12 And it is turned round about by his guidance, to execute what he commandeth it upon the face of the world, the earth. 
\v 13 Whether it be as a chastising rod—if this be destined for his earth—or for kindness, doth he cause it to come. 
\v 14 Give ear unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider well the wonders of God. 
\v 15 Dost thou know how God hath imposed [a law] on them, and [how] he hath caused the light of his cloud to shine? 
\v 16 Dost thou know aught about the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge? 
\v 17 [Thou] who clothest thyself with warm garments, when He giveth the earth rest from the south wind? 
\v 18 Hast thou with him spread out the skies, which are strong even as a molten mirror? 
\v 19 Let us know what we shall say unto him: we cannot set aught in order [before him] because of darkness. 
\v 20 Can [all] be related of him, when I speak [ever so much]? or if a man talk [of him] even till he be swallowed up [in death]? 
\v 21 Yet now men see not the light which is bright in the skies, when the wind hath passed along, and purified them. 
\v 22 The golden [light] that cometh out of the north: around God is terrible majesty. 
\v 23 The Almighty, whom we cannot find out, excellent in power, and in justice, and abounding in righteousness, will not afflict: 
\v 24 Therefore do men fear him; he respecteth not any that are wise of heart. 
\c 38  
\p
\v 1 Then did the Lord address Job out of the storm-wind, and said, 
\v 2 Who is this that casteth darkness [on my] counsel by words without knowledge? 
\v 3 Do but gird up like a mighty man thy loins: and I will ask thee, and do thou inform me. 
\v 4 Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? tell it, if thou hast any understanding [of it]. 
\v 5 Who fixed her measurements, if thou knowest it? or who stretched the measuring-line over her? 
\v 6 Upon what are her foundation-pillars placed at rest? or who laid her corner-stone: 
\v 7 When altogether sang the morning stars in gladness, and shouted for joy all the sons of God? 
\v 8 And who closed up with doors the sea, when, issuing forth, it came out of the deep bosom of the earth? 
\v 9 When I made the clouds its garment, and thick fog its swaddling-cloth, 
\v 10 And when I decreed for it my law, and set [for it] bars and doors, 
\v 11 And said, Thus far mayest thou come, but no farther; and here shall be stayed [thy strength] in the pride of thy waves? 
\v 12 Didst thou ever, in all thy days, command the morning; didst thou ever assign the morning-dawn its place: 
\v 13 That it might lay hold of the ends of the earth, so that the wicked might be shaken out therefrom? 
\v 14 She is changed as the sealing-clay: and [all things] stand as though newly clad. 
\v 15 And from the wicked is their light withdrawn, and the high-raised arm is broken. 
\v 16 Didst thou ever penetrate as far as the springs of the sea? or wander through the bottom of the deep? 
\v 17 Were the gates of death ever laid open unto thee? or canst thou see the doors of the shadow of death? 
\v 18 Hast thou a clear understanding of the breadth of the earth? Tell it, if thou knowest it all. 
\v 19 Where is the way [to the spot where] the light dwelleth? and the darkness—where is its place, 
\v 20 That thou mightest take each to its boundary, and that thou mightest mark the pathways to its house? 
\v 21 Thou [surely] knowest it; because thou wast then born, and the number of thy days is great! 
\v 22 Didst thou ever enter into the treasuries of the snow? or canst thou see the treasuries of the hail, 
\v 23 Which I have reserved for the time of distress, for the day of fight and battle? 
\v 24 Where is the way [to the spot where] the light divideth itself, [where] the east wind is scattered over the earth? 
\v 25 Who hath divided off watercourses for the overflowing rain, and a way for the lightning [that is followed by] thunders, 
\v 26 To bring rain on a land, void of men; on a wilderness wherein no son of earth [is found]; 
\v 27 To satisfy waste and desolate lands; and to promote the growth of the tender grass? 
\v 28 Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of the dew? 
\v 29 Out of whose womb cometh forth the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven—who giveth birth to it? 
\v 30 [When] like a stone the waters are congealed, and the face of the deep is bound in fetters? 
\v 31 Canst thou bind together the chains of the Pleiades, or loosen the bands of Orion? 
\v 32 Canst thou bring forth the constellations of the zodiac, each in its season? or canst thou guide the Bear with its young? 
\v 33 Knowest thou the laws of heaven? or dost thou appoint its rule on the earth? 
\v 34 Canst thou lift up to the clouds thy voice, that the abundance of waters may cover thee? 
\v 35 Canst thou send out lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, Here are we? 
\v 36 Who hath put wisdom in the dark clouds? or who hath given understanding to the bright meteors? 
\v 37 Who ordaineth the skies with wisdom? or who emptieth out the bottles of heaven. 
\v 38 When the dust is poured out as molten metal, and the clods are made to cleave fast together? 
\v 39 Dost thou hunt for the lioness her prey? and suppliest thou the food for the young lions, 
\v 40 When they are couched in their lairs, rest in the thicket, lying in wait? 
\v 41 Who provideth for the raven his provision? when his young ones cry unto God, and wander about for lack of food? 
\c 39  
\p
\v 1 Knowest thou the time when the chamois of the rock bring forth? or markest thou when the hinds do calve? 
\v 2 Numberest thou the months of gestation which they complete and knowest thou the time when they bring forth? 
\v 3 They bend themselves: they drop their young ones; throw off their pains. 
\v 4 Their little ones become strong; they grow up in the open field; they go forth, and return not unto them. 
\v 5 Who sent out the wild ass free? or who loosened the bonds of the forest-ass? 
\v 6 To whom I assigned the wilderness as his house, and the salty land as his dwellings. 
\v 7 He laugheth at the noise of a town, and the shoutings of the driver he heareth not. 
\v 8 What he espieth on the mountains is his pasture, and after every green thing doth he search. 
\v 9 Will the forest-ox be willing to serve thee, or will he stay over night at thy crib? 
\v 10 Canst thou bind the forest-ox with a rope [to labor] in the furrow? or will he harrow valleys, following after thee? 
\v 11 Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? and wilt thou leave to him thy labor? 
\v 12 Wilt thou confide in him, that he should bring home thy seed, and gather it into thy threshing-floor?— 
\v 13 The wing of the ostrich moveth joyfully: hath she the pinions and plumage of the careful stork? 
\v 14 [No,] for she intrusteth her eggs to the earth, and letteth them be hatched out on the dust: 
\v 15 And she forgetteth that a foot may crush them, or that the beast of the field may stamp them down. 
\v 16 He hath made her callous against her young, as though they were not hers: her labor is in vain, [but she feeleth] no dread; 
\v 17 Because God hath denied her wisdom, and he hath not imparted to her understanding. 
\v 18 At the time she raiseth herself up on high, she laugheth at the horse and his rider. 
\v 19 Dost thou give the horse strength? dost thou clothe his neck with the rolling mane? 
\v 20 Canst thou make him jump like a locust? his majestic snort is terrible. 
\v 21 Men spy about in the valley, and he rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth forth to meet the armed array. 
\v 22 He laugheth at fear, and is not dismayed; and turneth not back from before the sword. 
\v 23 Over him rattle the quiver, the glittering spear and the lance. 
\v 24 With impatient noise and rage he holloweth [with his hoof] the ground, and keepeth not quiet when the cornet's voice [is heard]. 
\v 25 Midst the sound of the cornet he uttereth his joyful neigh; and from afar he perceiveth the battle, the loud call of the captains, and the battle-cry.— 
\v 26 Is it through thy understanding that the hawk flieth along, and spreadeth out his wings toward the south? 
\v 27 Or is it by your order that the eagle doth mount upward, and buildeth high up his nest? 
\v 28 On a rock he dwelleth, and spendeth his nights, on a rocky crag and mountain fastness. 
\v 29 From there he espieth his food, from afar can his eyes behold. 
\v 30 His young ones, also, sip up blood: and where the slain be, there is he. 
\c 40  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord addressed Job, and said, 
\v 2 Will he that contendeth with the Almighty yet find fault? him that reproveth God answer this. 
\v 3 Then answered Job the Lord, and said, 
\v 4 Behold, I am too vile: what shall I answer thee? my hand do I place on my mouth. 
\v 5 Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will not repeat it again. 
\v 6 Then answered the Lord unto Job out of the storm-wind, and said, 
\v 7 Do but gird up like a mighty man thy loins: I will ask thee, and do thou inform me. 
\v 8 Wilt thou indeed annul my decree? wilt thou condemn me, in order that thou mayest appear righteous? 
\v 9 But if thou hast an arm like God, or if thou canst thunder loudly like him: 
\v 10 Then do deck thyself with excellence and greatness, and clothe thyself in majesty and glory. 
\v 11 Scatter abroad the ragings of thy wrath, and look on every proud one, and humble him. 
\v 12 Look on every proud one, and bend him low; and tread down the wicked in their place. 
\v 13 Hide them in the dust altogether: bind up their faces in concealment. 
\v 14 Then will I also myself praise thee, when thy own right hand hath helped thee. 
\v 15 Only behold Behemoth, which I made near thee: grass he eateth like the ox. 
\v 16 Only see, [how great] is his strength in his loins, and his force, in the muscles of his belly. 
\v 17 He stretcheth out his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his loins are closely wrapped together. 
\v 18 His bones are like pipes of brass: his frame is like bars of iron. 
\v 19 He is the first in rank of the works of God: he that made him can alone bring his sword near unto him. 
\v 20 But truly the mountains bear for him his food, and all the beasts of the field play there. 
\v 21 Under shady trees he lieth down, in the covert of the reeds, and swamp. 
\v 22 Shady trees cover him as his shadow: willows of the brook encompass him about. 
\v 23 Behold, a river sweepeth violently along, but he hasteneth not away: he remaineth quiet, though a Jordan rusheth up to his mouth. 
\v 24 Can one catch him before his eyes? pierce his nose by means of snares?— 
\c 41  
\p
\v 1 (40:25) Canst thou draw out the crocodile with a fishhook? or cause his tongue to sink into the batted rope? 
\v 2 (40:26) Canst thou put a reed through his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn? 
\v 3 (40:27) Will he address many supplications unto thee? or will he speak submissively unto thee? 
\v 4 (40:28) Will he make a covenant with thee? that thou couldst take him as a servant for ever? 
\v 5 (40:29) Canst thou play with him as with a bird? and tie him up for thy maidens? 
\v 6 (40:30) Can companions waylay him? can they divide him among merchants? 
\v 7 (40:31) Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? and [pierce] with a fish-spear his head? 
\v 8 (40:32) Lay thy hand upon him; think of the battle: thou wilt never do it again. 
\v 9 (41:1) Behold, his expectation was deceived: even at his mere sight is he cast down. 
\v 10 (41:2) None is so daring that he would stir him up: and who is there that will stand up before me? 
\v 11 (41:3) Who hath shown me favor, that I should repay him! whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.— 
\v 12 (41:4) I will not conceal [the account of] his limbs, nor the relation of his might, nor the grace of his proportion. 
\v 13 (41:5) Who hath ever laid open the front of his garment? or who can penetrate into his double row of teeth? 
\v 14 (41:6) Who hath opened the doors of his face? all round about his teeth abideth terror. 
\v 15 (41:7) What pride is there in [his] strong shields; he is locked up as with a close seal. 
\v 16 (41:8) One is joined to another; and no breath can come between them. 
\v 17 (41:9) They are fitted closely one to another: they are interlocked, that they cannot be severed. 
\v 18 (41:10) From his sneezing there beameth forth a light, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning-dawn. 
\v 19 (41:11) Out of his mouth issue burning torches, sparks of fire escape [therefrom]. 
\v 20 (41:12) Out of his nostrils cometh forth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron. 
\v 21 (41:13) His breath kindleth coals, and a flame cometh out of his mouth. 
\v 22 (41:14) In his neck abideth strength, and before him danceth terror joyfully. 
\v 23 (41:15) The flakes of his flesh are fitted closely together: they are as molten metal on him, immovable. 
\v 24 (41:16) His heart is firm like a stone: yea, as firm as the nether millstone. 
\v 25 (41:17) At his lifting himself up the mighty are terrified: the waves also are lessened. 
\v 26 (41:18) If one overtake him with the sword, it cannot hold; nor the spear, the dart, and armor. 
\v 27 (41:19) He esteemeth iron as straw, [and] brass as rotten wood. 
\v 28 (41:20) The child of the bow cannot make him flee: into stubble are slingstones changed unto him. 
\v 29 (41:21) Clubs are esteemed as stubble, and he laugheth at the whirring of the lance. 
\v 30 (41:22) Beneath him are sharp-pointed potsherds, he spreadeth out, [as it were, a] threshing-roller upon the mire. 
\v 31 (41:23) He causeth the deep to boil like a pot: he rendereth the sea like an apothecary's mixture. 
\v 32 (41:24) Behind him he causeth his pathway to shine, [so that] men esteem the deep to be hoary. 
\v 33 (41:25) There is none upon earth that ruleth over him, who is made to be without dread. 
\v 34 (41:26) He looketh upon all that is high: he is the king over all the ravenous beasts. 
\c 42  
\p
\v 1 Then answered Job unto the Lord, and said, 
\v 2 I acknowledge that thou art able to do every thing, and that no deep plan of thine can be restrained. 
\v 3 Who is he that dareth to conceal [thy] counsel without knowledge? Truly I have spoken of what I understood not, of things too wonderful for me, which I knew not. 
\v 4 Oh do but hear [me], and I will indeed speak: I will ask of thee, and do thou inform me. 
\v 5 I had only heard of thee by the hearing of the ear; but now my eye hath seen thee. 
\v 6 Therefore I reject [what I have said], and repent; because I am dust and ashes. 
\v 7 And it came to pass, after the Lord had spoken these words unto Job, that the Lord said to Eliphaz the Themanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends; because ye have not spoken of me properly, like my servant Job. 
\v 8 And now take unto yourselves seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up a burnt-offering in your behalf; and my servant Job shall pray for you; for him alone will I receive favorably, so as not to deal with you after your folly; because ye have not spoken of me properly, like my servant Job. 
\v 9 Then went Eliphaz the Themanite and Bildad the Shuchite and Zophar the Na'amathite, and did in accordance with what the Lord had spoken to them: and the Lord received Job in favor. 
\v 10 And the Lord brought back the captivity of Job, when he prayed in behalf of his friends; and the Lord increased all that Job had had twofold. 
\v 11 And then came unto him all his brothers, and all his sisters, and all that had been of his acquaintance before, and ate bread with him in his house; and they condoled with him, and comforted him for all the evil that the Lord had brought upon him; and they gave him, every one, a kessitah, and every one an earring of gold. 
\v 12 And the Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: and he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she-asses. 
\v 13 He had also seven sons and three daughters. 
\v 14 And he called the name of the first Jemimah; and the name of the second, Keziah; and the name of the third, Keren-happuch. 
\v 15 And there were not found such handsome women as the daughters of Job in all the land; and their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers. 
\v 16 And Job lived after this one hundred and forty years: and he saw his sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations. 
\v 17 Then died Job, being old and full of days.
