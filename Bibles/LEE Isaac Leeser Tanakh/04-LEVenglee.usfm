\v 1 And the Lord called unto Moses, and spoke unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying, 
\v 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any one of you wish to bring an offering unto the Lord: of the cattle, either of the herds, or of the flocks, shall ye bring your offering. 
\v 3 If his offering be a burnt-sacrifice of the herds, then shall he offer a male without blemish: unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation shall he bring it, that it may be favorably received for him before the Lord. 
\v 4 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the burnt-offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him. 
\v 5 And he shall kill the young steer before the Lord: and the sons of Aaron the priests shall bring near the blood, and they shall sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
\v 6 And he shall flay the burnt-offering, and cut it into its pieces. 
\v 7 And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay the wood in order upon the fire; 
\v 8 And the sons of Aaron the priests shall lay in order the parts, the head, and the fat, upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar; 
\v 9 But its inwards and its legs shall he wash in water; and the priest shall burn the whole on the altar, as a burnt-sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto the Lord. 
\v 10 And if his offering be of the flocks, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt-sacrifice: then shall he offer a male without blemish as the same. 
\v 11 And he shall kill it on the side of the altar, northward, before the Lord; and the sons of Aaron the priests shall sprinkle its blood upon the altar round about. 
\v 12 And he shall cut it into its pieces, with its head and its fat; and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar; 
\v 13 But the inwards and the legs shall he wash with water; and the priest shall bring near the whole, and burn it upon the altar; it is a burnt-sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto the Lord. 
\v 14 And if of fowls be the burnt-sacrifice for his offering to the Lord: then shall he bring his offering of turtle-doves, or of young pigeons. 
\v 15 And the priest shall bring it near unto the altar, and pinch off its head, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrung out on the wall of the altar. 
\v 16 And he shall remove its crop with its feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, at the place of the ashes. 
\v 17 And he shall cleave it by its wings, but shall not divide it asunder; and the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood that is on the fire: it is a burnt-sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto the Lord. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 And when any person wish to offer a meat-offering unto the Lord: then shall his offering be of fine flour; and he shall pour upon it oil, and put thereon frankincense; 
\v 2 And he shall bring it to one of the sons of Aaron the priest; and he shall take therefrom his handful of its flour, and of its oil, with all its frankincense; and the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, as an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto the Lord. 
\v 3 And what is left of the meat-offering shall belong to Aaron and to his sons: it is a most holy thing, from the fire-offerings of the Lord. 
\v 4 And if thou bring an oblation of a meat-offering baked in the oven, it shall be of fine flour, unleavened cakes mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil. 
\v 5 And if thy oblation be a meat-offering baked in a pan, it shall be made of fine flour mingled with oil, unleavened. 
\v 6 Thou shalt break it in pieces, and pour thereon oil: it is a meat-offering. 
\v 7 And if thy oblation be a meat-offering baked in the deep pan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil. 
\v 8 And thou shalt bring the meat-offering, which shall be made of these things, unto the Lord; and the offerer shall present it unto the priest, who shall bring it near unto the altar. 
\v 9 And the priest shall take up from the meat-offering its memorial, and shall burn it upon the altar: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto the Lord. 
\v 10 And that which is left of the meat-offering shall belong to Aaron and his sons: it is a most holy thing, from the fire-offerings of the Lord. 
\v 11 No meat-offering, which ye shall bring unto the Lord, shall be prepared leavened; for of whatever is leaven, or of any honey, ye shall not sacrifice an offering made by fire unto the Lord. 
\v 12 As an oblation of the first-fruits shall ye offer them unto the Lord: but on the altar shall they not come for a sweet savor. 
\v 13 And every oblation of thy meat-offering shalt thou season with salt; and thou shalt not suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meat-offering: with all thy offerings shalt thou offer salt. 
\v 14 And if thou offer a meat-offering of the first-fruits unto the Lord: of ripe ears of corn dried by the fire, of pounded corn out of full ears, shalt thou offer the meat-offering of thy first-fruits. 
\v 15 And thou shalt put upon it oil, and lay thereon frankincense: it is a meat-offering. 
\v 16 And the priest shall burn its memorial, from its pounded corn, and from its oil, with all its frankincense; it is an offering made by fire unto the Lord. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace-offering, if he offer it of the herds, whether it be a male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before the Lord. 
\v 2 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the sons of Aaron the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about. 
\v 3 And he shall offer the sacrifice of the peace-offering, as a fire-offering unto the Lord, the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, 
\v 4 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is on the flanks, and the midriff above the liver, with the kidneys, shall he remove it. 
\v 5 And Aaron's sons shall burn it on the altar, upon the burnt-offering, which is upon the wood that is on the fire: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto the Lord. 
\v 6 And if of the flocks be his offering for a sacrifice of peace-offering unto the Lord, male or female, without blemish, shall he offer it. 
\v 7 If he offer a sheep for his offering, then shall he bring it near before the Lord. 
\v 8 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation: and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle its blood upon the altar round about. 
\v 9 And he shall offer the sacrifice of the peace-offering, as a fire-offering unto the Lord, the best part thereof, the whole rump, hard by the backbone shall he take it off; and the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards; 
\v 10 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is on the flanks, and the midriff above the liver, with the kidneys, shall he remove it. 
\v 11 And the priest shall burn it upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire unto the Lord. 
\v 12 And if a goat be his offering, then shall he bring it near before the Lord. 
\v 13 And he shall lay his hand upon its head, and kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation: and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle its blood upon the altar round about. 
\v 14 And he shall offer thereof his offering, as a fire-offering unto the Lord, the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards. 
\v 15 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is on the flanks, and the midriff above the liver, with the kidneys shall he remove it. 
\v 16 And the priest shall burn them upon the altar; as the food of the offering made by fire for a sweet savor, is all the fat unto the Lord. 
\v 17 A perpetual statute shall it be for your generations throughout all your dwellings: no fat nor blood shall ye eat. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any person do sin through ignorance against any of the prohibitions of the Lord which ought not to be done, and do any of them; 
\v 3 If the anointed priest do sin to bring guiltiness on the people: then shall he bring near for his sin, which he hath committed, a young bullock without blemish, unto the Lord, for a sin-offering. 
\v 4 And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the Lord; and he shall lay his hand upon the head of the bullock, and kill the bullock before the Lord. 
\v 5 And the anointed priest shall take some of the bullock's blood, and bring it into the tabernacle of the congregation: 
\v 6 And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood; and he shall sprinkle of the blood seven times before the Lord, before the vail of the sanctuary. 
\v 7 And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar of the incense of spices before the Lord, which is in the tabernacle of the congregation; and all the [remaining] blood of the bullock shall he pour out at the bottom of the altar of burnt-offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
\v 8 And all the fat of the bullock of the sin-offering shall he take off from the same: the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, 
\v 9 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is on the flanks, and the midriff above the liver, with the kidneys, shall he remove it; 
\v 10 As it is taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace-offering; and the priest shall burn the same upon the altar of burnt-offering. 
\v 11 And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head, and with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung, 
\v 12 Even the whole bullock, shall he carry forth without the camp, unto a clean place, to where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood with fire; upon where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt. 
\v 13 And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance, and a thing be hidden from the eyes of the assembly, and they do any one of all the prohibitions of the Lord which ought not to be done, and they become guilty; 
\v 14 When now the sin becometh known, through which they have sinned: then shall the congregation offer a young bullock for a sin-offering, and shall bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation. 
\v 15 And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before the Lord; and they shall kill the bullock before the Lord. 
\v 16 And the anointed priest shall bring some of the bullock's blood into the tabernacle of the congregation: 
\v 17 And the priest shall dip his finger in some of the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before the Lord, before the vail. 
\v 18 And some of the blood shall be put upon the horns of the altar which is before the Lord, that is in the tabernacle of the congregation; and all the [remaining] blood shall he pour out at the bottom of the altar of burnt-offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
\v 19 And all his fat shall he take from him, and burn it upon the altar. 
\v 20 And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock of the sin-offering; so shall he do with this: and the priest shall make an atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven unto them. 
\v 21 And he shall carry forth the bullock to without the camp, and burn him as he burnt the first bullock; it is a sin-offering of the congregation. 
\v 22 If a ruler should sin, and do any one of the prohibitions of the Lord his God which ought not to be done, through ignorance, and become guilty; 
\v 23 If now his sin, wherein he hath sinned, come to his knowledge: he shall bring as his offering, a goat, a male, without blemish; 
\v 24 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it on the place where they kill the burnt-offering before the Lord; it is a sin-offering. 
\v 25 And the priest shall take some of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering; and [the remainder of] its blood shall he pour out at the bottom of the altar of burnt-offering. 
\v 26 And all its fat shall he burn upon the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace-offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven unto him. 
\v 27 And if any person of the common people should sin through ignorance, by his doing any one of the prohibitions of the Lord, which ought not to be done, and become guilty; 
\v 28 If now his sin, which he hath committed, come to his knowledge: then shall he bring as his offering, a goat, a female, without blemish, for his sin which he hath committed; 
\v 29 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin-offering, and slay the sin-offering on the place of the burnt-offering. 
\v 30 And the priest shall take some of the blood thereof with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering; and all the [remaining] blood thereof shall he pour out at the bottom of the altar. 
\v 31 And all the fat thereof shall he remove, as the fat is removed from off the sacrifice of peace-offering; and the priest shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savor unto the Lord: and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven unto him. 
\v 32 And if he bring a sheep for a sin-offering, a female without blemish shall he bring it. 
\v 33 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin-offering, and slay it for a sin-offering on the place where they kill the burnt-offering. 
\v 34 And the priest shall take some of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering; and all the [remaining] blood thereof shall he pour out at the bottom of the altar: 
\v 35 And all the fat thereof shall he remove, as the fat of the sheep is removed from the sacrifice of the peace-offering; and the priest shall burn the same upon the altar, upon the offerings made by fire unto the Lord; and the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sin that he hath committed, and it shall be forgiven unto him.

\p
\v 1 And if any person sin, because he heareth the voice of adjuration, and he is a witness, since he hath either seen or knoweth something; if he do not tell it, and thus bear his iniquity; 
\v 2 Or if there be a person who toucheth any unclean thing, whether it be the carcass of an unclean beast, or the carcass of unclean cattle, or the carcass of an unclean creeping thing, and it escape his recollection; but [he becometh aware that] he is unclean, and hath [thus] incurred guilt; 
\v 3 Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever uncleanness of the kind it be by which he can be defiled, and it escape his recollection; but he becometh aware of it, and [that] he hath [thus] incurred guilt; 
\v 4 Or if any person swear, by pronouncing with his lips to do evil, or to do good [to himself], in whatsoever it be that a man pronounceth with an oath, and it escape his recollection; but he becometh aware of it that he hath incurred guilt by any one of these: 
\v 5 And it shall be, if he have incurred guilt by any one of these [things,] that he shall confess that concerning which he hath sinned; 
\v 6 And he shall bring his trespass-offering unto the Lord for his sin which he hath committed, a female from the flocks, a sheep or a goat, for a sin-offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his sin. 
\v 7 And if his means be not sufficient for a sheep, then shall he bring as his offering [for the trespass] which he hath committed, two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, unto the Lord; one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering. 
\v 8 And he shall bring them unto the priest, and he shall offer that which is for the sin-offering first, and pinch off its head by the back of its neck, but shall not divide it asunder: 
\v 9 And he shall sprinkle some of the blood of the sin-offering upon the wall of the altar: and the rest of the blood shall be wrung out at the bottom of the altar; it is a sin-offering. 
\v 10 And the second shall he prepare as a burnt-offering, according to the prescribed order; and the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sin which he hath committed, and it shall be forgiven unto him. 
\v 11 But if his means be not sufficient for two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, then shall he bring as his offering for that which he hath sinned, the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin-offering; he shall not put upon it any oil, nor shall he put thereupon any frankincense; for it is a sin-offering. 
\v 12 And he shall bring it to the priest; and the priest shall take from it his handful, as its memorial, and burn it on the altar, upon the fire-offerings of the Lord: it is a sin-offering. 
\v 13 And the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his sin that he hath committed in one of these, and it shall be forgiven unto him; and it shall belong to the priest, as the meat-offering. 
\v 14 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 15 If any person commit a trespass, and sin through ignorance, against the holy things of the Lord: then shall he bring as his trespass-offering unto the Lord a ram without blemish out of the flocks, in value of two shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass-offering. 
\v 16 And that, in which he hath sinned against the holy thing, shall he pay, and shall add its fifth part thereto, and give it unto the priest; and the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass-offering, and it shall be forgiven unto him. 
\v 17 And if any person sin, and commit any one of the prohibitions of the Lord which ought not to be done; and he know not whether he have incurred guilt, and so bear his iniquity: 
\v 18 Then shall he bring a ram without blemish out of the flocks, of the usual value, for a trespass-offering, unto the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his sin of ignorance, wherein he hath erred and knoweth it not, and it shall be forgiven unto him. 
\v 19 It is a trespass-offering: he hath in trespassing trespassed against the Lord. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1 (5:20) And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 (5:21) If any person sin, and commit a trespass against the Lord; if he, namely, lie unto his neighbor in that which was delivered to him to keep, or in a loan, or in a thing taken away by violence, or if he have withheld the wages of his neighbor; 
\v 3 (5:22) Or if he have found something which was lost, and lie concerning it, and swear falsely; in any one of all these which a man can do, to sin thereby: 
\v 4 (5:23) Then shall it be, when he hath sinned and is conscious of his guilt, that he shall restore what be hath taken violently away, or the wages which he hath withheld, or that which was delivered to him to keep, or the lost thing which he hath found, 
\v 5 (5:24) Or any one thing about which he may have sworn falsely; and he shall restore it in its principal, and the fifth part thereof shall he add thereto; unto him to whom it appertaineth shall he give it, on the day when he confesseth his trespass. 
\v 6 (5:25) And his trespass-offering shall he bring unto the Lord, a ram without blemish out of the flocks, of the usual value, for a trespass-offering, unto the priest: 
\v 7 (5:26) And the priest shall make an atonement for him before the Lord, and it shall be forgiven unto him, for any one thing of all that he may have done to trespass thereby. 
\v 8 (6:1) And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 9 (6:2) Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt-offering: It is the burnt-offering, which shall be burning upon the altar all night unto the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be burning on it. 
\v 10 (6:3) And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh, and he shall lift up the ashes which the fire hath made by consuming the burnt-offering on the altar, and he shall place them beside the altar. 
\v 11 (6:4) And he shall take off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes to without the camp, unto a clean place. 
\v 12 (6:5) And the fire upon the altar shall be burning on it, it shall not be put out, and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning: and he shall lay in order upon it the burnt-offering, and he shall burn thereon the fat of the peace-offerings. 
\v 13 (6:6) A perpetual fire shall be burning upon the altar; it shall not go out. 
\v 14 (6:7) And this is the law of the meat-offering: [one of] the sons of Aaron shall bring it near before the Lord, in front of the altar. 
\v 15 (6:8) And he shall lift up from it his handful, of the flour of the meat-offering, and of its oil, and all the frankincense which is upon the meat-offering, and he shall burn it upon the altar, for a sweet savor, as its memorial, unto the Lord. 
\v 16 (6:9) And what is left thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: unleavened shall it be eaten in a holy place; in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation shall they eat it. 
\v 17 (6:10) It shall not be baked leaven; as their portion have I given it from my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as is the sin-offering, and as is the trespass-offering. 
\v 18 (6:11) all the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it, as a fixed portion for ever in your generations from the fire-offerings of the Lord: every one that toucheth the same shall be holy. 
\v 19 (6:12) And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 20 (6:13) This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto the Lord on the day when he is anointed: the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meat-offering perpetually; half of it in the morning, and the other half of it in the evening. 
\v 21 (6:14) In a pan, with oil, shall it be made, well sodden shalt thou bring it; twice baked, a meat-offering of broken pieces, shalt thou offer it for a sweet savor unto the Lord. 
\v 22 (6:15) And the priest that shall be anointed in his stead among his sons shall offer it: it is a statute for ever, unto the Lord; it shall be wholly burnt. 
\v 23 (6:16) And every meat-offering of a priest shall be wholly burnt, it shall not be eaten. 
\v 24 (6:17) And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 25 (6:18) Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin-offering: On the place where the burnt-offering is killed shall the sin-offering be killed before the Lord; it is most holy. 
\v 26 (6:19) The priest who maketh atonement with its blood shall eat it: in a holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
\v 27 (6:20) Whatsoever may touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and if there should be sprinkled any of its blood upon a garment, whatever it hath been sprinkled on shalt thou wash out in a holy place. 
\v 28 (6:21) And any earthen vessel wherein it may have been boiled shall be broken: and if it have been boiled in a copper vessel, it shall be both scoured and rinsed with water. 
\v 29 (6:22) Every male among the priests may eat thereof: it is most holy. 
\v 30 (6:23) And every sin-offering whereof any of the blood is brought into the tabernacle of the congregation to make atonement therewith in the holy place, shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt in fire. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1 And this is the law of the trespass-offering: It is most holy. 
\v 2 On the place where they kill the burnt-offering shall they kill the trespass-offering; and the blood thereof shall be sprinkled upon the altar round about. 
\v 3 And all its fat shall be offered up from it; the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards, 
\v 4 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is on the flanks, and the midriff above the liver, with the kidneys shall he remove the same: 
\v 5 And the priest shall burn them upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto the Lord; it is a trespass-offering. 
\v 6 Every male among the priests may eat thereof; in a holy place shall it be eaten: it is most holy. 
\v 7 As the sin-offering is, so is the trespass-offering; there is one law for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith, his shalt it be. 
\v 8 And the priest that offereth any man's burnt-offering,—the skin of the burnt-offering which he hath offered shall belong to this priest alone. 
\v 9 And every meat-offering that is baked in the oven, and all that is dressed in the deep pan, and in the flat pan, shall belong to the priest that offereth it alone. 
\v 10 And every meat-offering which is mingled with oil, or dry, shall belong to all the sons of Aaron, to one as much as the other. 
\v 11 And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace-offering, which one may happen to offer unto the Lord. 
\v 12 If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then shall he offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and fine flour, well sodden, made into cakes mingled with oil. 
\v 13 Together with cakes of leavened bread shall he bring his offering, with the sacrifice of his thanksgiving peace-offering. 
\v 14 And he shall offer thereof one out of every oblation for a heave-offering unto the Lord; to the priest that sprinkleth the blood of the peace-offering—to him shall it belong. 
\v 15 And the flesh of the sacrifice of his thanksgiving-peace-offering shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall not leave any of it until the morning. 
\v 16 But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his sacrifice: and on the morrow also shall what is left thereof be eaten. 
\v 17 But what is left of the flesh of the sacrifice, on the third day shall it be burnt with fire. 
\v 18 And if the intention was to eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offering on the third day, it shall not be favorably received; to him who offereth it shall it not be accounted; it shall be an abomination, and the person that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity. 
\v 19 And the flesh, that toucheth any unclean thing, shall not be eaten, with fire shall it be burnt: and as for the flesh, every one that is clean may eat thereof. 
\v 20 But the person that eateth the flesh of the sacrifice of peace-offering, that pertaineth unto the Lord, having his uncleanness upon him, even that person shall be cut off from his people. 
\v 21 And any person that toucheth any unclean thing, as the uncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable unclean thing, and eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace-offering, which pertaineth unto the Lord, even that person shall be cut off from his people. 
\v 22 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 23 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Every manner of fat, of ox, or of sheep, or of goat shall ye not eat. 
\v 24 And the fat of a beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn by beasts, may be used for any manner of work, but ye shall in no wise eat of it. 
\v 25 For whosoever eateth the fat of the cattle, of which one can offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord, even the person that eateth it shall be cut off from his people. 
\v 26 Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, in any of your dwellings, whether it be of fowl or of cattle. 
\v 27 Whatsoever person it be that eateth any manner of blood, even that person shall be cut off from his people. 
\v 28 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 29 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, He that offereth the sacrifice of his peace-offering unto the Lord shall bring his oblation unto the Lord from the sacrifice of his peace-offering. 
\v 30 His own hands shall bring it, as the fire-offerings of the Lord: the fat with the breast shall he bring, the breast that it may be waved for a wave-offering before the Lord. 
\v 31 And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar; but the breast shall belong to Aaron and to his sons. 
\v 32 And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for a heave-offering, of the sacrifices of your peace-offerings. 
\v 33 The one that offereth the blood of the peace-offerings and the fat, among the sons of Aaron, shall have the right shoulder for his part. 
\v 34 For the breast which hath been waved and the shoulder which hath been lifted up have I taken from the children of Israel from the sacrifices of their peace-offerings; and I have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons as a fixed portion for ever from the children of Israel. 
\v 35 This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the anointing of his sons, from the fire-offerings of the Lord, on the day when he brought them near to become priests unto the Lord; 
\v 36 Which the Lord commanded to give unto them, on the day that he anointed them, from the children of Israel, as a fixed portion for ever throughout their generations. 
\v 37 This is the law of the burnt-offering, of the meat-offering, and of the sin-offering, and of the trespass-offering, and of the consecration-offering, and of the sacrifice of the peace-offering; 
\v 38 Which the Lord commanded Moses on mount Sinai, on the day that be commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations unto the Lord, in the wilderness of Sinai. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and the bullock for the sin-offering, and the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread; 
\v 3 And all the congregation shalt thou assemble together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
\v 4 And Moses did as the Lord had commanded him; and the assembly came together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
\v 5 And Moses said unto the congregation, This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded to do. 
\v 6 And Moses brought near Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water. 
\v 7 And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put upon him the ephod, and he girded him with the belt of the ephod, and bound it unto him therewith. 
\v 8 And he put on him the breastplate; and he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim. 
\v 9 And he put the mitre upon his head; and he placed upon the mitre, toward the front thereof, the golden plate, the holy crown; as the Lord had commanded Moses. 
\v 10 And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein, and sanctified them. 
\v 11 And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times; and he anointed the altar and all its vessels, also the laver and its foot, to sanctify them. 
\v 12 And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and he anointed him, to sanctify him. 
\v 13 And Moses brought near the sons of Aaron, and clothed them with coats, and girded them with girdles, and bound the bonnets on them; as the Lord had commanded Moses. 
\v 14 And he brought near the bullock of the sin-offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock of the sin-offering. 
\v 15 And some one slew him; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and the [remaining] blood he poured out at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it, to make henceforth atonement upon it. 
\v 16 And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the midriff of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses burnt them upon the altar. 
\v 17 But the bullock, and his hide, and his flesh, and his dung, he burnt with fire without the camp; as the Lord had commanded Moses. 
\v 18 And he brought near the ram of the burnt-offering; and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram. 
\v 19 And some one killed him; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about. 
\v 20 And the ram he cut into the proper pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the pieces, and the fat. 
\v 21 And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt-sacrifice for a sweet savor, an offering made by fire unto the Lord; as the Lord had commanded Moses. 
\v 22 And he brought near the other ram, the ram of consecration; and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram. 
\v 23 And some one slew him; and Moses took some of his blood, and put it upon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot. 
\v 24 And he brought near Aaron's sons, and Moses put some of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about. 
\v 25 And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the midriff of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right shoulder; 
\v 26 And out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before the Lord, he took one unleavened cake, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and he put them on the fat, and upon the right shoulder; 
\v 27 And he placed the whole upon the hands of Aaron, and upon the hands of his sons, and made with them a waving before the Lord. 
\v 28 And Moses then took these things from off their hands, and burnt them on the altar upon the burnt-offering: they were a consecration-offering for a sweet savor, a fire-offering were they unto the Lord. 
\v 29 And Moses took the breast, and made therewith a waving before the Lord; from the ram of consecration was it given to Moses as his portion; as the Lord had commanded Moses. 
\v 30 And Moses took some of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was upon the altar, and sprinkled the same upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and his sons with sanctified upon the garments of him; and he Aaron, his garments, and his sons, and the garments of his sons with him. 
\v 31 And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil ye the flesh at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation; and there shall ye eat it with the bread that is in the basket of the consecration; as I have commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it. 
\v 32 And that which is left of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire. 
\v 33 And from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation shall ye not go forth seven days, until the days of your consecration be at an end; for seven days shall your consecration last. 
\v 34 As they have done this day, so hath the Lord commanded to do farther, to make an atonement for you. 
\v 35 And at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation shall ye abide day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the Lord, that ye die not; for so have I been commanded. 
\v 36 And Aaron and his sons did all the things which the Lord had commanded by the hand of Moses. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass on the eighth day that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel; 
\v 2 And he said unto Aaron, Take unto thyself a young calf for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering, without blemish, and bring them near before the Lord. 
\v 3 And unto the children of Israel shalt thou speak, saying, Take ye a he-goat for a sin-offering; and a calf and a sheep, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt-offering; 
\v 4 Also a bullock and a ram for peace-offerings, to sacrifice before the Lord, and a meat-offering mingled with oil; for this day the Lord will appear unto you. 
\v 5 And they brought that which Moses had commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the Lord. 
\v 6 And Moses said, This thing which the Lord hath commanded shall ye do: and then will the glory of the Lord appear unto you. 
\v 7 And Moses said unto Aaron, Draw near unto the altar, and prepare thy sin-offering, and thy burnt-offering, and make an atonement for thyself, and for the people; and prepare the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the Lord hath commanded. 
\v 8 And Aaron drew near unto the altar; and he slew the calf of the sin-offering, which was for himself. 
\v 9 And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him; and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar; and the [remaining] blood he poured out at the bottom of the altar. 
\v 10 And the fat, and the kidneys, and the midriff from the liver of the sin-offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the Lord had commanded Moses. 
\v 11 And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp. 
\v 12 And he slew the burnt-offering; and the sons of Aaron presented unto him the blood, and he sprinkled it upon the altar round about. 
\v 13 And the burnt-offering they presented unto him, in its proper pieces, together with the head: and he burnt them upon the altar. 
\v 14 And he washed the inwards and the legs; and he burnt them upon the burnt-offering on the altar. 
\v 15 And he brought near the people's offering; and he took the goat of the sin-offering which belonged to the people, and slew it, and made atonement with its blood, as the first. 
\v 16 And he brought near the burnt-offering, and offered it according to the prescribed manner. 
\v 17 And he brought near the meat-offering, and he filled his hand thereof, and burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt-sacrifice of the morning. 
\v 18 He slew also the bullock and the ram, the sacrifice of peace-offering which belonged to the people: and the sons of Aaron presented unto him the blood, and he sprinkled it upon the altar round about, 
\v 19 Also the fat of the bullock, and of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the midriff of the liver; 
\v 20 And they put these pieces of fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar; 
\v 21 And with the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron made a waving before the Lord; as Moses had commanded. 
\v 22 And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them; and came down after he had offered the sin-offering, and the burnt-offering, and peace-offerings. 
\v 23 And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came then out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the Lord appeared unto all the people. 
\v 24 And there came forth a fire from before the Lord, and consumed upon the altar the burnt-offering and the fat; and when all the people saw this, they shouted, and fell on their faces. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1 And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took each his censer, and they put therein fire, and put thereon incense: and they brought near before the Lord a strange fire, which he had not commanded them. 
\v 2 And there went out a fire from before the Lord, and consumed them, and they died before the Lord. 
\v 3 Then said Moses unto Aaron, This is what the Lord hath spoken, saying, On those who are near unto me will I be sanctified, and before all the people will I be glorified: and Aaron held his peace. 
\v 4 And Moses called unto Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of 'Uzziel, the uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary to without the camp. 
\v 5 And they came near, and carried them in their coats to without the camp; as Moses had spoken. 
\v 6 And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Elazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, The hair of your head you shall not let grow long, and your garments you shall not rend, that ye die not, and that he be not wroth upon the whole congregation; but your brethren, the whole house of Israel, may bewail the burning which the Lord hath kindled. 
\v 7 And from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation shall ye not go out, lest ye die; for the anointing oil of the Lord is upon you; and they did according to the word of Moses. 
\v 8 And the Lord spoke unto Aaron, saying, 
\v 9 Wine or strong drink shalt thou not drink, neither thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go in unto the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations. 
\v 10 So that ye may be able to distinguish between the holy and the unholy, and between the unclean and the clean; 
\v 11 And that ye may be able to teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the Lord hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses. 
\v 12 And Moses spoke unto Aaron, and unto Elazar and unto Ithamar his sons, that were left, Take ye the meat-offering that is left of the fire-offerings of the Lord, and eat it unleavened beside the altar; for it is most holy. 
\v 13 And ye shall eat it in a holy place, because it is thy fixed portion, and the fixed portion of thy sons, from the fire-offerings of the Lord; for so have I been commanded. 
\v 14 And the breast which hath been waved and the shoulder which hath been lifted up, shall ye eat in a clean place, thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee; for as thy fixed portion, and the fixed portion of thy sons, have they been given from the sacrifices of peace-offerings of the children of Israel. 
\v 15 The shoulder which is waved and the breast which is lifted up, shall they bring with the fat of the fire-offering, to make therewith a waving before the Lord: and then shall it be thine, and thy sons with thee, as a fixed portion for ever; as the Lord hath commanded. 
\v 16 And the goat of the sin-offering Moses sought diligently, and behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Elazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron who had been left, and said, 
\v 17 Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin-offering in the holy place, seeing that it is most holy, and that he hath given it to you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the Lord? 
\v 18 Behold, its blood was not brought within the holy place: ye should then have eaten it in the holy place, as I commanded. 
\v 19 And Aaron spoke unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin-offering, and their burnt-offering before the Lord; and things as these have befallen me: and if I had eaten the sin-offering today, would it have been pleasing in the eyes of the Lord? 
\v 20 And when Moses heard this, it was pleasing in his eyes. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spoke unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them, 
\v 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the beasts which ye may eat among all the beasts that are on the earth. 
\v 3 Whatsoever divideth the hoof, and is cloven-footed, and cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that may ye eat. 
\v 4 But these shall ye not eat, of those that chew the cud, or of those that divide the hoof: the camel; because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you. 
\v 5 And the cony; because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you. 
\v 6 And the hare; because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you. 
\v 7 And the swine; because he divideth the hoof, and is cloven-footed, but he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean unto you. 
\v 8 Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcass shall ye not touch; they are unclean unto you. 
\v 9 These may ye eat, of all that are in the waters: all that have fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them may ye eat. 
\v 10 But all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of whatever moveth in the waters, and of any living thing which is in the waters, shall be an abomination unto you: 
\v 11 And an abomination shall they remain unto you; of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcasses ye shall have in abomination. 
\v 12 Whatsoever hath not fins and scales in the waters, shall be an abomination unto you. 
\v 13 And these shall ye have in abomination among the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: The eagle, and the ossifrage, and the osprey, 
\v 14 And the vulture, and the kite after his kind; 
\v 15 Every raven after his kind: 
\v 16 And the ostrich, and the night-hawk, and the cuckoo, and the hawk after his kind; 
\v 17 And the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl, 
\v 18 And the swan, and the pelican, and the gier-eagle, 
\v 19 And the stork, the heron after his kind, and the lapwing, and the bat. 
\v 20 All flying insects that walk upon four feet, shall be an abomination unto you. 
\v 21 Yet these may ye eat, among all the flying insects that walk on four feet, which have spring-legs above their feet, to leap therewith upon the earth. 
\v 22 These of them may ye eat: The locust after its kind, and the sol'am after its kind, and the chargol after its kind, and the chagab after its kind. 
\v 23 But all flying insects, which have four feet, shall be an abomination unto you; 
\v 24 And through these shall ye be rendered unclean: whosoever toucheth the carcass of them shall be unclean until the evening; 
\v 25 And whosoever beareth aught of their carcass shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening. 
\v 26 Every species of beast, which divideth the hoof and is not cloven-footed nor cheweth the cud, is unclean unto you: every one that toucheth the same shall be unclean. 
\v 27 And all that walk upon their paws, among all manner of beasts that walk on four feet, are unclean unto you; whosoever toucheth their carcass shall be unclean until the evening. 
\v 28 And he that beareth their carcass shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening: unclean shall they be unto you. 
\v 29 And these shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth: The weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after its kind, 
\v 30 And the hedgehog, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the snail, and the mole. 
\v 31 These shall be unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth touch them, when they are dead, shall be unclean until the evening. 
\v 32 And every thing upon which any part of them, when they are dead, doth fall, shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, every vessel wherewith any work can be done, must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the evening, when it shall be clean. 
\v 33 And every earthen vessel whereinto any part of them falleth, whatsoever is in it shall be unclean; and itself shall ye break. 
\v 34 All kinds of food which may be eaten, on which water cometh, shall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk, shall be rendered unclean in every vessel. 
\v 35 And every thing whereupon any part of their carcass falleth, shall be unclean; an oven, or ranges for pots, shall be broken down, they are unclean; and unclean shall they be unto you. 
\v 36 Nevertheless, a fountain, or pit, receptacles for water, shall be clean; but he that toucheth their carcass shall be unclean. 
\v 37 And if any part of their carcass fall upon any sowing-seed which hath been sown, it shall be clean. 
\v 38 But if any water be put upon the seed, and any part of their carcass fall thereon, it shall be unclean unto you. 
\v 39 And if any cattle die, which is allowed to you as food: he that toucheth its carcass shall be unclean until the evening. 
\v 40 And he that eateth of its carcass shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening; he also that beareth its carcass shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening. 
\v 41 And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth is an abomination, it shall not be eaten. 
\v 42 Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon four feet, down to whatsoever hath many feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth, shall ye not eat; for they are an abomination. 
\v 43 Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth; and ye shall not make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby. 
\v 44 For I am the Lord your God; ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I am holy: neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. 
\v 45 For I am the Lord that have brought you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God; ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy. 
\v 46 This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth: 
\v 47 To distinguish between the unclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born a male child: then shall she be unclean seven days, even as in the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean. 
\v 3 And on the eighth day shall the flesh of his foreskin be circumcised. 
\v 4 And thirty and three days shall she then continue in the blood of her purification; any thing hallowed shall she not touch, and into the sanctuary shall she not come, until the days of her purification be at an end. 
\v 5 But if she bear a female child, then shall she be unclean two weeks as in her separation; and sixty and six days shall she continue in the blood of the purification. 
\v 6 And at the completion of the days of her purification, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a sheep of the first year for a burnt-offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtle-dove, for a sin-offering, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest. 
\v 7 And he shall bring it near before the Lord, and make an atonement for her, and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood: this is the law for her that hath given birth to a male or to a female. 
\v 8 And if her means will not suffice for a lamb, then shall she take two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, the one for a burnt-offering, and the other for a sin-offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for her, and she shall be clean. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 
\v 2 If a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a swelling, a rising, or a bright spot, and it might become in the skin of his flesh the plague of leprosy: then shall he be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests. 
\v 3 And if the priest shall see the plague in the skin of the flesh, and the hair in the plague be turned white, and the appearance of the plague be deeper than the skin of his flesh: it is a plague of leprosy; and [so soon as] the priest shall see him, he shall pronounce him unclean. 
\v 4 But if it be a white bright spot in the skin of his flesh, and its appearance be not deeper than the skin, and the hair be not turned white: then shall the priest shut up the plague seven days. 
\v 5 And the priest shall see him on the seventh day; and, behold, if the plague have remained unchanged in its appearance, the plague have not spread in the skin: then shall the priest shut him up seven days more. 
\v 6 And the priest shall see him again on the seventh day; and, behold, if the plague be somewhat pale, and the plague have not spread in the skin: then shall the priest pronounce him clean; it is a rising, and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean. 
\v 7 But if the rising should spread abroad in the skin, after he hath been seen by the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen again by the priest. 
\v 8 And if the priest see that, behold, the rising have spread abroad in the skin, then shall the priest pronounce him unclean: it is leprosy. 
\v 9 If the plague of leprosy happen to be on a man, then shall he be brought unto the priest; 
\v 10 And the priest shall see, and, behold, if there be a white swelling in the skin, and the hair in it have turned white, or there be a trace of healthy flesh in the swelling: 
\v 11 It is an inveterate leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean; he shall not shut him up, for he is unclean. 
\v 12 And if the leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of [him that hath] the plague from his head even to the feet, so far as the eyes of the priest can see: 
\v 13 If now the priest should see, that, behold, the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce the plague clean; it is all turned white, he is clean. 
\v 14 But on the day that healthy flesh appeareth therein, he shall be unclean. 
\v 15 And the priest shall see the healthy flesh, and pronounce him to be unclean; the healthy flesh is unclean, it is the leprosy. 
\v 16 Or if the healthy flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he shall come unto the priest; 
\v 17 And if the priest see him, and, behold, the plague be turned into white: then shall the priest pronounce the plague clean, he is clean. 
\v 18 And if there be a person who hath had in his skin an inflammation, and hath been healed, 
\v 19 And if there be on the place of the inflammation a white swelling, or a white and dark red bright spot, he shall be shown to the priest; 
\v 20 And if the priest see, and, behold, its appearance be lower than the skin, and the hair thereof have been turned white: then shall the priest pronounce him unclean, it is the plague of leprosy broken out in the inflammation. 
\v 21 But if the priest see it, and, behold, there be no white hair therein, and if it be not lower than the skin, and it be pale: then shall the priest shut him up seven days. 
\v 22 And if it now spread abroad in the skin, then shall the priest pronounce him unclean: it is the plague [of leprosy]. 
\v 23 But if the bright spot remain in its place, and spread not, it is a scar of the inflammation; and the priest shall pronounce him clean. 
\v 24 Or if there be a person in whose skin there is a place burnt by fire, and the mark of the burning become a bright spot, white and dark red, or white; 
\v 25 And if the priest see it, and, behold, the hair in the bright spot have been turned white, and its appearance be deeper than the skin: it is leprosy, broken out in the fire-wound; and the priest shall pronounce him unclean, it is the plague of leprosy. 
\v 26 But if the priest see it, and, behold, there be in the bright spot no white hair, and it be not lower than the skin, and it be pale: then shall the priest shut him up seven days. 
\v 27 And the priest shall see him on the seventh day: if now it have spread abroad in the skin, then shall the priest pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy. 
\v 28 And if the bright spot remain in its place, [and] it have not spread abroad in the skin, and it be pale: it is a swelling of the fire-wound; and the priest shall pronounce him clean; for it is a scar of the fire-wound. 
\v 29 And if there be a man or woman on whom there arise a plague, on the head or on the beard; 
\v 30 Then shall the priest see the plague; and, behold, if its appearance be deeper than the skin, and there be in it a yellow thin hair: then shall the priest pronounce him unclean, it is a dry scall, it is the leprosy of the head or of the beard. 
\v 31 And if the priest see the plague of the scall, and, behold, its appearance be not deeper than the skin, and there be no black hair in it: then shall the priest shut up the plague of the scall seven days. 
\v 32 And the priest shall see the plague on the seventh day; and, behold, if the scall have not spread, and there be in it no yellow hair, and the appearance of the scall be not deeper than the skin: 
\v 33 Then shall he be shaved, but the scall he shall not shave; and the priest shall shut up the scall seven days more. 
\v 34 And the priest shall see the scall on the seventh day; and, behold, if the scall have not spread in the skin, and its appearance be not deeper than the skin: then shall the priest pronounce him clean, and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean. 
\v 35 But if the scall should spread abroad in the skin after his being pronounced clean: 
\v 36 Then shall the priest see him; and, behold, if the scall have spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for the yellow hair; he is unclean. 
\v 37 But if the scall have remained stationary in its color, and black hair have grown up therein: the scall is then healed, he is clean; and the priest shall pronounce him clean. 
\v 38 And if there be a man or a woman having in the skin of their flesh bright spots, white bright spots; 
\v 39 And if the priest do see, and, behold, there are in the skin of their flesh bright spots, pale and white: it is a freckly eruption grown in the skin; he is clean. 
\v 40 And if there be a man whose hair of the head fall off, he is a bald head; he is clean. 
\v 41 And if from the side of his face his hair fall off, he is forehead-bald; he is clean. 
\v 42 But if there be on the bald head, or the bald forehead, an eruption, white and dark red: it is the leprosy sprung up on his bald head, or his bald forehead. 
\v 43 And the priest shall see him; and, behold, if the swelling of the eruption be white and dark red on his bald head, or on his bald forehead, like the appearance of the leprosy on the [other parts of the] skin of the flesh: 
\v 44 He is a leprous man, he is unclean; the priest shall pronounce him unclean; his plague is on his head. 
\v 45 And the leper on whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and his head shall be bare, and he shall cover himself up to his upper lip, and, Unclean, unclean, shall he call out. 
\v 46 All the days whereon the plague which rendereth unclean is on him, he shall be unclean; alone shall he dwell; without the camp shall his habitation be. 
\v 47 And if there be a garment on which there arise a plague of leprosy, whether it be on a woollen garment, or on a linen garment; 
\v 48 Whether it be on the warp, or on the woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether on a skin, or on any thing made of skin; 
\v 49 And the plague be dark green or dark red, on the garment, or on the skin, or on the warp, or on the woof, or on any article made of skin: it is the plague of leprosy; and it shall be shown unto the priest. 
\v 50 And the priest shall see the plague, and shut up the plague seven days. 
\v 51 And if he see the plague on the seventh day, that the plague have spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in the skin, or in any article that is made of skin: the plague is a corroding leprosy; it is unclean. 
\v 52 And he shall then burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in woollen or in linen, or any article of skin, whereon the plague is; for it is a corroding leprosy, in fire shall it be burnt. 
\v 53 And if the priest shall see, and, behold, the plague have not spread on the garment, either on the warp, or on the woof, or on any article of skin: 
\v 54 Then shall the priest command that they wash the thing whereon the plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more. 
\v 55 And if the priest see, after the plague hath been washed, and, behold, the plague have not changed its color, and the plague have not spread: it is unclean, in fire shalt thou burn it; it is a decay on its inside or on its outside. 
\v 56 And if the priest see, and, behold, the plague have become pale after its having been washed: then shall he tear it out from the garment, or from the skin, or from the warp, or from the woof. 
\v 57 And if it appear again on the garment, either on the warp, or on the woof, or on any instrument of skin: it is a growing plague; with fire shalt thou burn that whereon the plague is. 
\v 58 And the garment, either the warp or the woof, or every instrument of skin, which thou shalt wash, and the plague depart therefrom, shall be washed the second time, when it shall be clean. 
\v 59 This is the law of the plague of leprosy on a garment of woollen or linen, either in the warp, or the woof, or any article of skin, to pronounce it clean, or unclean. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 This shall be the law of the leper on the day of his being cleansed: He shall be brought unto the priest. 
\v 3 And the priest shall go forth to without the camp; and if the priest see, and, behold, the plague of leprosy be healed on the leper: 
\v 4 Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two healthy, clean birds, and cedar wood, and a string of scarlet yarn, and hyssop. 
\v 5 And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water. 
\v 6 As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the string of scarlet yarn, and the hyssop, and he shall dip these and the living bird into the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water: 
\v 7 And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times; and when he hath cleansed him, he shall let the living bird fly forth into the open field. 
\v 8 And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and wash himself in water, and he shall be clean, and after that he may come into the camp; but he shall tarry outside of his tent seven days. 
\v 9 And it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave off all his hair, his head, and his beard, and his eyebrows, even all his hair shall he shave off: and he shall wash his clothes, he shall also wash his flesh in water, when he shall be clean. 
\v 10 And on the eighth day he shall take two sheep without blemish, and one ewe of the first year without blemish, and three-tenth parts of fine flour for a meat-offering, mingled with oil, and one log of oil. 
\v 11 And the priest who cleanseth shall cause the man that is to be made clean, and these things, to stand before the Lord, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: 
\v 12 And the priest shall take the one sheep, and offer the same for a trespass-offering, with the log of oil; and he shall make with them a waving before the Lord. 
\v 13 And he shall slay the sheep on the place where the sin-offering and the burnt-offering are killed, in the holy place; for as the sin-offering so doth the trespass-offering belong to the priest: it is most holy. 
\v 14 And the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass-offering; and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot. 
\v 15 And the priest shall take some of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand. 
\v 16 And the priest shall dip his finger of the right hand in the oil that is in his left hand, and he shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before the Lord. 
\v 17 And of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass-offering. 
\v 18 And what is left of the oil that is in the priest's hand, he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed: and the priest shall [thus] make an atonement for him before the Lord. 
\v 19 And the priest shall prepare the sin-offering, and make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness; and afterward shall he kill the burnt-offering: 
\v 20 And the priest shall offer the burnt-offering and the meat-offering upon the altar; and the priest shall [thus] make an atonement for him, and he shall be clean. 
\v 21 But if he be poor, and his means do not suffice, then shall he take one sheep for a trespass-offering to be waved, to make an atonement for him; and one-tenth part of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat-offering, and a log of oil; 
\v 22 And two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, for which his means suffice; and one shall be a sin-offering, and the other a burnt-offering. 
\v 23 And he shall bring them on the eighth day of his being cleansed unto the priest, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, before the Lord. 
\v 24 And the priest shall take the sheep of the trespass-offering, and the log of oil; and the priest shall make with them a waving before the Lord. 
\v 25 And he shall kill the sheep of the trespass-offering; and the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass-offering, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot. 
\v 26 And some of the oil shall the priest pour into the palm of his own left hand: 
\v 27 And the priest shall sprinkle with his finger of the right hand some of the oil that is in his left hand, seven times before the Lord; 
\v 28 And the priest shall put of the oil that is in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot; upon the place of the blood of the trespass-offering; 
\v 29 And what is left of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make an atonement for him before the Lord. 
\v 30 And he shall offer the one of the turtle-doves, or of the young pigeons, from what his means enable him [to bring]; 
\v 31 Even what his means enable him, the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, with the meat-offering: and the priest shall [thus] make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed, before the Lord. 
\v 32 This is the law of him on whom is the plague of leprosy, whose means are not sufficient when he is cleansed. 
\v 33 And the Lord spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 
\v 34 When ye come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy on a house of the land of your possession: 
\v 35 Then shall he that owneth the house come and tell the priest, saying, Something like a leprosy hath shown itself to me in the house. 
\v 36 And the priest shall command that they clear out the house, before the priest go into it to see the plague, that all be not made unclean that is in the house: and after this shall the priest go in to see the house. 
\v 37 And he shall view the plague, and, behold, if the plague be in the walls of the house, in depressions, dark green or dark red, and their appearance be deeper than the wall: 
\v 38 Then shall the priest go out of the house to the door of the house, and lock up the house seven days. 
\v 39 And the priest shall come again on the seventh day; and if he see, that, behold, the plague have spread in the walls of the house: 
\v 40 Then shall the priest command that they break out the stones on which the plague is; and they shall cast them forth without the city on an unclean place. 
\v 41 And the house he shall cause to be scraped within round about; and they shall pour out the rubbish that they have scraped off without the city on an unclean place. 
\v 42 And they shall take other stones, and put them into the place of these stones; and other mortar shall he take, and shall plaster the house. 
\v 43 And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after he hath taken away the stones, and after the house hath been scraped, and after it hath been plastered: 
\v 44 Then shall the priest come; and if he see that, behold, the plague have spread in the house, it is a corrosive leprosy in the house; it is unclean. 
\v 45 And he shall break down the house, its stones, and the timbers thereof, and all the mortar of the house; and he shall carry them forth to without the city, unto an unclean place. 
\v 46 And he that goeth into the house, all the days that it is locked up, shall be unclean until the evening. 
\v 47 And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes. 
\v 48 But if the priest should come in, and see, and, behold, the plague have not spread in the house, after the house was plastered: then shall the priest pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed. 
\v 49 And he shall take, to atone for the house, two birds, and cedar wood, and a string of scarlet yarn, and hyssop; 
\v 50 And he shall kill the one bird in an earthen vessel over running water; 
\v 51 And he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet yarn, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle on the house seven times: 
\v 52 And he shall atone for the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the string of scarlet yarn; 
\v 53 But he shall let fly forth the living bird out of the city into the open field, and make [thus] an atonement for the house, and it shall be clean. 
\v 54 This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and scall, 
\v 55 And for the leprosy of a garment and of a house, 
\v 56 And for a swelling, and for a rising, and for a bright spot; 
\v 57 To teach on the day when something is unclean, and on the day when it is clean: this is the law of the leprosy. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spoke unto Moses and to Aaron, saying, 
\v 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any man have a running issue out of his flesh: because of his issue is he unclean. 
\v 3 And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue: whether his flesh run with his issue, or his flesh be stopped from his issue, it is his uncleanness. 
\v 4 Every bed, whereon he may lie that hath the issue, shall be unclean: and every vessel, whereon he may sit, shall be unclean. 
\v 5 And any man that toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening. 
\v 6 And he that sitteth on any vessel whereon he that hath the issue may sit, shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening. 
\v 7 And he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening. 
\v 8 And if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean: then shall this one wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening. 
\v 9 And what saddle soever he that hath the issue may ride upon shall be unclean. 
\v 10 And whatsoever toucheth any thing, that may be under him, shall be unclean until the evening: and he that beareth any of these things shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening. 
\v 11 And whomsoever he that hath the issue may touch, and he have not rinsed his hands in water, shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening. 
\v 12 And an earthen vessel that he who hath the issue may touch, shall be broken; and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water. 
\v 13 And when he that hath an issue becometh clean of his issue: then shall he number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in running water, and then shall he be clean. 
\v 14 And on the eighth day shall he take unto himself two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, and come before the Lord, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and give them unto the priest: 
\v 15 And the priest shall offer them, the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the Lord for his issue. 
\v 16 And if any man's seed of copulation go out from him, then shall he bathe all his flesh in water, and be unclean until the evening. 
\v 17 And any garment, and any skin, whereon the seed of copulation may be, shall be washed with water, and be unclean until the evening. 
\v 18 And if a man should lie with a woman with seed of copulation, then shall they bathe themselves in water, and be unclean until the evening. 
\v 19 And if a woman have an issue, so that blood flow from her flesh: then shall she be in her state of separation seven days; and whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean until the evening. 
\v 20 And every thing that she may lie upon in her separation shall be unclean: and whatever she may sit upon shall be unclean. 
\v 21 And whosoever toucheth her bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening. 
\v 22 And whosoever toucheth any vessel, that she may sit upon, shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening. 
\v 23 And if something be on the bed, or on any thing whereon she may sit, when he toucheth it, he shall be unclean until the evening. 
\v 24 And if any man should lie with her, and the uncleanness of her separation come upon him, he shall be unclean seven days; and every bed whereon he may lie shall be unclean. 
\v 25 And if a woman have an issue of her blood many days out of the time of her separation, or if it run beyond the time of her separation: all the days of the issue of her uncleanness shall she be as in the days of her separation; she shall be unclean. 
\v 26 Every bed whereon she may lie all the days of her issue shall be unto her as the bed of her separation; and whatever vessel she may sit upon shall be unclean, as the uncleanness of her separation. 
\v 27 And whosoever toucheth these things shall be unclean; and he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening. 
\v 28 And when she becometh clean of her issue, then shall she number to herself seven days, and after that shall she be clean. 
\v 29 And on the eighth day shall she take unto herself two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, and bring them unto the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
\v 30 And the priest shall offer the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for her before the Lord for the issue of her uncleanness. 
\v 31 And ye shall separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness; that they may not die in their uncleanness, when they defile my tabernacle that is in their midst. 
\v 32 This is the law of him that hath an issue, and of him whose seed goeth from him, and is defiled therewith; 
\v 33 And of her that is suffering in her separation, and of him that hath an issue, of the man, and of the woman, and of him that lieth with her that is unclean. 
\c 16  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spoke unto Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they had come near before the Lord, and died: 
\v 2 And the Lord said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all times into the holy place within the vail, before the mercy-seat, which is upon the ark, that he die not; for in the cloud will I appear upon the mercy-seat. 
\v 3 With this shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering. 
\v 4 A holy linen coat shall be put on, and linen breeches shall he have upon his flesh, and with a linen girdle shall he gird himself, and a linen mitre shall he bind on his head; these are holy garments; therefore shall he wash his flesh in water, and then put them on. 
\v 5 And from the congregation of the children of Israel shall he take two goats for a sin-offering, and one ram for a burnt-offering. 
\v 6 And Aaron shall bring near the bullock of the sin-offering, which is for himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his house. 
\v 7 And he shall take the two goats, and place them before the Lord at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
\v 8 And Aaron shall put lots upon the two goats; one lot “for the Lord,” and the other lot “for 'Azazel.” 
\v 9 And Aaron shall bring near the goat upon which fell the lot “for the Lord,” and offer him for a sin-offering. 
\v 10 But the goat on which fell the lot “for 'Azazel,” shall be placed alive before the Lord, to make an atonement with him, by sending him away to 'Azazel into the wilderness. 
\v 11 And Aaron shall bring near the bullock of the sin-offering, which is for himself, and he shall make an atonement for himself, and for his house; and he shall kill the bullock of the sin-offering which is for himself. 
\v 12 And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the Lord, and both his hands full of incense of spices, pounded fine, and bring it within the vail; 
\v 13 And he shall put the incense upon the fire, before the Lord; that the cloud of the incense may envelop the mercy-seat that is upon the testimony, that he die not. 
\v 14 And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with his finger above toward the mercy-seat, eastward; and before the mercy-seat shall he sprinkle seven times of the blood with his finger. 
\v 15 And he shall kill the goat of the sin-offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood to within the vail, and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it above the mercy-seat, and before the mercy-seat. 
\v 16 And he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation, that abideth among them in the midst of their uncleanness. 
\v 17 And there shall not be any man in the tabernacle of the congregation when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy place, until he come out: and so shall he make an atonement for himself, and for his household, and for the whole congregation of Israel. 
\v 18 And he shall then go out unto the altar that is before the Lord, and make an atonement upon it; and he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about. 
\v 19 And he shall sprinkle upon it of the blood with his finger seven times; and he shall cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel. 
\v 20 And when he hath made an end of atoning for the holy place, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar: then shall he bring near the live goat. 
\v 21 And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and he shall send him away by the hand of a man appointed thereto into the wilderness: 
\v 22 And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited; and so shall he send away the goat into the wilderness. 
\v 23 And Aaron shall then go into the tabernacle of the congregation, and he shall take off the linen garments, which he had put on when he went into the holy place, and he shall leave them there: 
\v 24 And he shall bathe his flesh with water in a holy place, and put on his garments; and come then forth, and offer his burnt-offering, and the burnt-offering of the people, and make an atonement for himself, and for the people. 
\v 25 And the fat of the sin-offering shall he burn upon the altar. 
\v 26 And he that carrieth the goat to 'Azazel shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he may come into the camp. 
\v 27 And the bullock for the sin-offering, and the goat for the sin-offering, the blood of which was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, shall one carry forth without the camp; and they shall burn in fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung. 
\v 28 And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he may come into the camp. 
\v 29 And it shall be unto you a statute for ever: in the seventh month, on the tenth of the month, ye shall afflict yourselves [by fasting], and no work shall ye do, whether it be one of your own country, or the stranger that sojourneth among you; 
\v 30 For on that day shall [the high-priest] make an atonement for you, to cleanse you; from all your sins before the Lord shall ye be clean. 
\v 31 It shall be a sabbath of rest unto you, and ye shall afflict yourselves [by fasting], as a statute for ever. 
\v 32 And the priest, who shall be anointed, and who shall be consecrated to minister as priest in his father's stead, shall make the atonement; and he shall put on the linen clothes, the holy garments. 
\v 33 And he shall make an atonement for the holy of holies; and for the tabernacle of the congregation, and for the altar shall he make an atonement; and also for the priests, and for all the people of the congregation shall he make an atonement. 
\v 34 And this shall be unto you as a statute for everlasting, to make an atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year: and he did as the Lord had commanded Moses. 
\c 17  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them, This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded, saying, 
\v 3 Any man whatsoever of the house of Israel, that killeth an ox, or a sheep, or a goat, in the camp, or that killeth it out of the camp, 
\v 4 And bringeth it not to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer it as an offering unto the Lord before the tabernacle of the Lord: as blood-guiltiness shall it be imputed unto that man, blood hath he shed; and that man shall be cut off from among his people. 
\v 5 In order that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they slay in the open field, and bring them unto the Lord, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest, and slay them as sacrifices of peace-offerings unto the Lord. 
\v 6 And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the Lord at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation; and he shall burn the fat for a sweet savor unto the Lord. 
\v 7 So that they shall offer no more their sacrifices unto evil spirits, after which they have gone astray: a statute for ever shall this be unto them throughout their generations. 
\v 8 And unto them shalt thou say, Whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who may sojourn among them, that offereth a burnt-offering or a sacrifice, 
\v 9 And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer it unto the Lord: even that man shall be cut off from among his people. 
\v 10 And if there be any man of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, that eateth any manner of blood: I will set my face against the person that eateth the blood, and I will cut him off from among his people. 
\v 11 For the life of the flesh is in the blood; and I have appointed it for you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls; for the blood it is that maketh an atonement for the soul. 
\v 12 Therefore have I said unto the children of Israel, No one of you shall eat blood, and the stranger that sojourneth among you shall not eat blood. 
\v 13 And if there be any man whatsoever of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, who catcheth by hunting any beast or fowl that may be eaten: then shall he pour out the blood thereof, and cover it up with dust. 
\v 14 For the life of all flesh is its blood, on which its life dependeth; therefore have I said unto the children of Israel, The blood of every manner of flesh shall ye not eat; for the life of all flesh is its blood, every one who eateth it shall be cut off. 
\v 15 And every person that eateth that which hath died of itself, or that which was torn by beasts, be this one born in your own country, or a stranger, shall both wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening, when he shall be clean. 
\v 16 But if he wash [them] not, nor bathe his flesh, then shall he bear his iniquity. 
\c 18  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am the Lord your God. 
\v 3 After the doings of the Land of Egypt, wherein ye have dwelt, shall ye not do; and after the doings of the land of Canaan whither I am bringing you, shall ye not do; and in their customs shall ye not walk. 
\v 4 My ordinances shall ye do, and my statutes shall ye keep, to walk therein: I am the Lord your God. 
\v 5 And ye shall keep my statutes, and my ordinances, which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am the Lord. 
\v 6 None of you shall approach to any that are near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness: I am the Lord. 
\v 7 The nakedness of thy father, or the nakedness of thy mother, shalt thou not uncover: she is thy mother, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness. 
\v 8 The nakedness of thy father's wife shalt thou not uncover: it is thy father's nakedness. 
\v 9 The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or the daughter of thy mother, whether she be born at home, or born abroad,—even the nakedness of any of these shalt thou not uncover. 
\v 10 The nakedness of thy son's daughter, or of thy daughter's daughter,—even the nakedness of any of these, shalt thou not uncover; for theirs is thy own nakedness. 
\v 11 The nakedness of thy father's wife's daughter, begotten of thy father, she is thy sister,—thou shalt not uncover her nakedness. 
\v 12 The nakedness of thy father's sister shalt thou not uncover: she is thy father's near kinswoman. 
\v 13 The nakedness of thy mother's sister shalt thou not uncover; for she is thy mother's near kinswoman. 
\v 14 The nakedness of thy father's brother shalt thou not uncover: his wife shalt thou not approach, she is thy aunt. 
\v 15 The nakedness of thy daughter-in-law shalt thou not uncover: she is thy son's wife, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness. 
\v 16 The nakedness of thy brother's wife shalt thou not uncover: it is thy brother's nakedness. 
\v 17 The nakedness of a woman and her daughter shalt thou not uncover: her son's daughter, or her daughter's daughter shalt thou not take, to uncover her nakedness; for they are near kinswomen; it is incest. 
\v 18 And a woman together with her sister shalt thou not take, to vex her, to uncover her nakedness, beside the other, in her lifetime. 
\v 19 And a woman in the separation of her uncleanness shalt thou not approach, to uncover her nakedness. 
\v 20 And with thy neighbor's wife shalt thou not lie carnally, to defile thyself with her. 
\v 21 And any of thy seed shalt thou not let pass through [the fire] to Molech, and thou shalt not profane the name of thy God: I am the Lord. 
\v 22 And with a man shalt thou not lie, as with a woman: it is an abomination. 
\v 23 And with any beast shalt thou not lie to defile thyself therewith; neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto: it is confusion. 
\v 24 Do not defile yourselves through any of these things.; for through all these have become defiled the nations which I cast out before you: 
\v 25 And the land became defiled; wherefore I have visited its iniquity upon it, and the land itself vomited out its inhabitants. 
\v 26 Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my ordinances, and ye shall not commit any of these abominations; neither any of your own nation, nor the stranger that sojourneth among you; 
\v 27 (For all these abominations have the men of the land done, who were before you, and the land hath become defiled;) 
\v 28 That the land may not vomit you out also, when ye defile it, as it hath vomited out the nations that were before you. 
\v 29 For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations,— even the souls that commit them shall be cut off from among their people. 
\v 30 Therefore shall ye keep my charge, so that ye commit not any one of these abominable customs, which were committed before you, and that ye do not defile yourselves therewith: I am the Lord your God. 
\c 19  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Ye shall be holy; for I the Eternal your God am holy. 
\v 3 Ye shall fear, every man, his mother and his father, and my sabbaths shall ye keep: I am the Lord your God. 
\v 4 Ye shall not turn unto the idols, and molten gods shall ye not make to yourselves: I am the Lord your God. 
\v 5 And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace-offering unto the Lord, ye shall offer it so that it may be favorably received from you. 
\v 6 On the same day ye offer it shall it be eaten, and on the morrow: and whatever is left until the third day, shall be burnt with fire. 
\v 7 And if the intention was that it should be eaten on the third day, it is an abomination, it shall not be favorably received. 
\v 8 And whoever eateth it shall bear his iniquity; because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the Lord: and that soul shall be cut off from among his people. 
\v 9 And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather up the gleanings of thy harvest. 
\v 10 And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, and the single grapes that drop in thy vineyard shalt thou not gather up; for the poor and the stranger shalt thou leave them: I am the Lord your God. 
\v 11 Ye shall not steal; neither shall ye deny [another's property in your hands], nor lie one to another. 
\v 12 And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, and thou shalt not thus profane the name of thy God: I am the Lord. 
\v 13 Thou shalt not withhold any thing from thy neighbor, nor rob him: there shall not abide with thee the wages of him that is hired, through the night until morning. 
\v 14 Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumbling-block before the blind; but thou shalt be afraid of thy God: I am the Lord. 
\v 15 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment; thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the great; in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbor. 
\v 16 Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people; thou shalt not stand [idly] by the blood of thy neighbor: I am the Lord. 
\v 17 Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart: thou shalt indeed rebuke thy neighbor, and not bear sin on account of him. 
\v 18 Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people; but thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself: I am the Lord. 
\v 19 My statutes shall ye keep; thy cattle shalt thou not let gender with a diverse kind; thy field shalt thou not sow with mingled seeds; and a garment of mingled kinds, of linen and woollen, shall not come upon thee. 
\v 20 And if a man lie carnally with a woman, that is a bond-maid, betrothed to a man, but who hath neither been redeemed, nor hath her freedom been given her: there shall a scourging be decreed; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free. 
\v 21 And he shall bring his trespass-offering unto the Lord, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: a ram for a trespass-offering. 
\v 22 And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass-offering before the Lord for his sin which he hath done; and he shall be forgiven for his sin which he hath committed. 
\v 23 And when ye come into the land, and plant any kind of tree bearing edible fruit, then shall ye count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you, it shall not be eaten. 
\v 24 But in the fourth year shall all its fruit be holy for praise-giving unto the Lord. 
\v 25 And in the fifth year shall ye eat of its fruit, in order that it may increase unto you its productiveness: I am the Lord your God. 
\v 26 Ye shall not eat upon the blood; nor shall ye use enchantment, nor observe times. 
\v 27 Ye shall not cut round the corners [of the hair] of your head, neither shalt thou destroy the corners of thy beard. 
\v 28 And for the dead shall ye not make any incision in your flesh; and any etched-in writing shall you not fix on yourselves: I am the Lord. 
\v 29 Do not profane thy daughter, to cause her to be a prostitute; lest the land fall to prostitution, and the land become full of incest. 
\v 30 My sabbaths shall ye keep, and my sanctuary shall ye reverence: I am the Lord. 
\v 31 Turn not unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards; seek [them] not, to be defiled by them: I am the Lord your God. 
\v 32 Before the hoary head shalt thou rise up, and honor the face of the old man; and thou shalt be afraid of thy God: I am the Lord. 
\v 33 And if a stranger sojourn with thee, in your land, ye shall not vex him. 
\v 34 As one born in the land among you, shall be unto you the stranger that sojourneth with you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God. 
\v 35 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in measure. 
\v 36 Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I am the Lord your God, who have brought you forth out of the land of Egypt. 
\v 37 Ye shall therefore observe all my statutes, and all my ordinances, and do them: I am the Lord. 
\c 20  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 And to the children of Israel shalt thou say, Whatsoever man of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that giveth any of his seed unto Molech, shall surely be put to death; the people of the land shall stone him with stones. 
\v 3 And I will set my face against that man, and I will cut him off from among his people; because of his seed hath he given unto Molech, in order to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name. 
\v 4 And if the people of the land should in any way hide their eyes from that man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, so as not to kill him: 
\v 5 Then will I set my face against that man, and against his family, and I will cut him off, and all that go astray after him, to go astray after Molech, from among their people. 
\v 6 And the person that turneth unto such as have familiar spirits, and unto wizards, to go astray after them,—then will I set my face against that person, and will cut him off from among his people. 
\v 7 Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy; for I am the Lord your God. 
\v 8 And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am the Lord who sanctify you. 
\v 9 For every one whatever that curseth his father or his mother shall be put to death: his father or his mother hath he cursed, his blood shall be upon him. 
\v 10 And if there be a man that committeth adultery with a man's wife, [whoever it be] that committeth adultery with his neighbor's wife: then shall the adulterer be put to death, together with the adulteress. 
\v 11 And a man that lieth with his father's wife, hath uncovered his father's nakedness: both of them shall be put to death; their blood shall be upon them. 
\v 12 And if a man lie with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall be put to death: they have committed an unnatural deed; their blood shall be upon them. 
\v 13 And if a man lie with a male, as they lie with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall be put to death; their blood shall be upon them. 
\v 14 And if a man take a woman and her mother, it is incest: in fire shall they burn him and them; that there be no incest among you. 
\v 15 And a man that lieth with a beast shall be put to death: and the beast also shall ye slay. 
\v 16 And if a woman approach unto any beast to lie down thereto, then shalt thou kill the woman, and the beast; they shall be put to death; their blood shall be upon them. 
\v 17 And if a man take his sister, the daughter of his father, or the daughter of his mother, and he see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness: it is a disgraceful deed; and they shall be cut off before the eyes of their people: the nakedness of his sister hath he uncovered; his iniquity shall he bear. 
\v 18 And if a man lie with a woman suffering of her separation, and uncover her nakedness, and he lay open her fountain, and she uncover the fountain of her blood: then shall both of them be cut off from the midst of their people. 
\v 19 And the nakedness of thy mother's sister, or of thy father's sister shalt thou not uncover; for his near of kin he uncovereth: their iniquity shall they bear. 
\v 20 And the man that lieth with his uncle's wife, hath uncovered his uncle's nakedness: their sin shall they bear; childless shall they die. 
\v 21 And if a man do take his brother's wife, it is an abominable act: the nakedness of his brother hath he uncovered; childless shall they remain. 
\v 22 And keep ye all my statutes, and all my ordinances, and do them; that the land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, may not vomit you forth. 
\v 23 And ye shall not walk in the customs of the nation which I cast out before you; for all these things they committed, and therefore I felt loathing for them. 
\v 24 And I said unto you, Ye shall possess their land, and I will give it unto you to possess it, a land flowing with milk and honey: I am the Eternal your God, who have separated you from the nations. 
\v 25 Ye shall therefore make a difference between the clean beast and the unclean, and between the unclean fowl and the clean; and ye shall not make your souls abominable by the beast, or by the fowl, or by any manner of thing that creepeth on the ground, which I have separated from you as unclean. 
\v 26 And ye shall be holy unto me, for I the Lord am holy; and I have separated you from the nations, that ye should be mine. 
\v 27 And if there be among men or women one that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, they shall be put to death; with stones shall they stone them; their blood shall be upon them. 
\c 21  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord said unto Moses, Speak unto the priests the sons of Aaron, and say unto them, None [of them] shall defile himself on the dead, among his people; 
\v 2 But on his kin, that is near unto him, [that is,] on his mother, and on his father, and on his son, and on his daughter, and on his brother, 
\v 3 And on his sister that is a virgin, that is nigh unto him, who hath had no husband: on her may he defile himself. 
\v 4 The chief man among his people shall not defile himself, to be profaned thereby. 
\v 5 They shall not make any baldness upon their head, and the corner of their beard shall they not shave off, and in their flesh shall they not make any incision. 
\v 6 Holy shall they be unto their God, and they shall not profane the name of their God; for the fire-offerings of the Lord, the bread of their God, do they offer, they shall therefore be holy. 
\v 7 A woman that is a harlot, or one profaned, shall they not take; and a woman put away from her husband shall they not take; for holy is he unto his God. 
\v 8 And thou shalt sanctify him; for the bread of thy God doth he offer: holy shall he be unto thee; for I the Lord, who sanctify you, am holy. 
\v 9 And if the daughter of any priest profane herself by committing incest, her father doth she profane: with fire shall she be burnt. 
\v 10 And the priest that is highest among his brethren, upon whose head the anointing oil hath been poured, and who hath been consecrated to put on the garments, shall not let the hair of his head grow long, and his garments shall he not rend; 
\v 11 Neither shall he go in to any dead body; even on his father, and on his mother shall he not defile himself. 
\v 12 And out of the sanctuary shall he not go, that he may not profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him: I am the Lord. 
\v 13 And he shall take a wife in her virgin state. 
\v 14 A widow, and a divorced woman, and one profaned, [and] a harlot, these shall he not take; but a virgin of his own people shall he take for wife; 
\v 15 So that he may not profane his seed among his people; for I, the Lord, do sanctify him. 
\v 16 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 17 Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever of thy seed in their generations it be on whom there is any blemish, shall not approach to offer the bread of his God. 
\v 18 For whatsoever man it be on whom there is a blemish, shall not approach: a blind, or a lame man, or one that hath a flattened nose, or a man one of whose limbs is too long, 
\v 19 Or a man who hath a broken foot, or a broken hand, 
\v 20 Or a crookbacked, or a dwarf, or one that hath a blemish in his eye, or the itch, or the scurvy, or the testicles broken. 
\v 21 Every man on whom there is a blemish, of the seed of Aaron the priest, shall not come nigh to offer the fire-offerings of the Lord: there is a blemish on him; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God. 
\v 22 The brewed of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy things he may eat. 
\v 23 Only unto the vail, and unto the altar shall he not come nigh, because there is a blemish on him; that he profane not my holy things; for I the Lord do sanctify them. 
\v 24 And Moses spoke thus unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel. 
\c 22  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they keep themselves away from the holy things of the children of Israel, [so that they profane not my holy name] which they hallow unto me: I am the Lord. 
\v 3 Say unto them, In your generations, if there be any man of all your seed, that approacheth unto the holy things, which the children of Israel hallow unto the Lord, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from my presence: I am the Lord. 
\v 4 Any man whatsoever of the seed of Aaron, that is a leper, or hath a running issue, shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean; and whoso toucheth any thing that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him; 
\v 5 Or a man who toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man through whom he can be rendered unclean, through any kind of uncleanness which he hath: 
\v 6 The person that toucheth any such shall be unclean until the evening, and he shall not eat of the holy things, unless he have bathed his flesh in water. 
\v 7 And when the sun hath set, he shall be clean; and afterward he may eat of the holy things; because it is his food. 
\v 8 That which dieth of itself, or is torn by beasts, shall he not eat, to defile himself therewith: I am the Lord. 
\v 9 And they shall keep my charge, that they may not bear sin through it, and die therefore, if they profane it: I am the Lord who sanctify them. 
\v 10 And no stranger shall eat of a holy thing: a sojourner of a priest, or a hired servant, shall not eat of a holy thing. 
\v 11 But if a priest buy a person with his money, then may he eat of it; and those that are born in his house, may eat of his bread. 
\v 12 And if the daughter of a priest be married unto a stranger, she may not eat of the offered part of holy things. 
\v 13 But the daughter of a priest, if she be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and is returned unto her father's house, as in her youth, may eat of her father's bread; but no stranger shall eat thereof. 
\v 14 And if a man eat a holy thing unwittingly, then shall he add the fifth part thereof unto it, and he shall make good unto the priest the holy thing. 
\v 15 And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto the Lord; 
\v 16 And load on themselves the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things; for I am the Lord who sanctify them. 
\v 17 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 18 Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them, If there be any man of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that offereth his oblation, be it for any manner of vows, or for any manner of freewill-offerings, which they may offer unto the Lord for a burnt-offering: 
\v 19 Then shall it be, that it may be favorably received for you, a male without blemish, of the oxen, of the sheep, or of the goats. 
\v 20 Whatsoever on which there is a blemish shall ye not offer; for it will not be favorably received for you. 
\v 21 And when a man offereth a sacrifice of peace-offering unto the Lord as a vow, or a freewill-offering of the herds or of the flocks: it shall be without blemish to be favorably received; no kind of bodily defect shall be thereon. 
\v 22 A blind, or broken-limbed, or maimed animal, or one having a wen, or itch, or scurvy,—ye shall not offer these unto the Lord, and a fire-offering shall ye not make of them upon the altar unto the Lord. 
\v 23 And an ox or a lamb that hath a limb too long or too short, that mayest thou offer for a freewill-offering; but for a vow it shall not be favorably received. 
\v 24 And one that is bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut in the testicles, shall ye not offer unto the Lord; and in your land shall ye not make the like. 
\v 25 And from a stranger's hand shall ye not offer the bread of your God from any of these; because their corruption is on them, a bodily defect is on them: they shall not be favorably received for you. 
\v 26 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 27 When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then shall it remain seven days by its mother; and from the eighth day and thenceforth shall it be favorably received for an offering made by fire unto the Lord. 
\v 28 And whether it be ox or sheep, ye shall not kill it and its young both in one day. 
\v 29 And when ye offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the Lord, offer it so that it may be favorably received of you. 
\v 30 On the same day shall it be eaten up; ye shall leave none of it until the morning: I am the Lord. 
\v 31 And ye shall keep my commandments and do them: I am the Lord. 
\v 32 And ye shall not profane my holy name; so that I may be sanctified among the children of Israel; I am the Lord who sanctify you, 
\v 33 That brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be unto you a God: I am the Lord. 
\c 23  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, The feasts of the Lord, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations,—these are my feasts: 
\v 3 Six days may work be done; but on the seventh day is the sabbath of rest, a holy convocation; no kind of work shall ye do thereon; it is the sabbath [holy] unto the Lord in all your dwellings. 
\v 4 These are the feasts of the Lord, the holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their seasons: 
\v 5 On the fourteenth day of the first month, toward evening, is the passover-lamb to be offered unto the Lord. 
\v 6 And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the Lord: seven days must ye eat unleavened bread. 
\v 7 On the first day there shall be a holy convocation unto you; no servile work shall ye do thereon. 
\v 8 And ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord seven days: on the seventh day is a holy convocation; no servile work shall ye do. 
\v 9 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 10 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye shall have come into the land which I give unto you, and reap the harvest thereof: then shall ye bring an omer full of the first of your harvest unto the priest; 
\v 11 And he shall wave the omer before the Lord, that it may be favorably received for you; on the morrow after the holy day shall the priest wave it. 
\v 12 And ye shall offer on the day when ye wave the omer, a male sheep without blemish of the first year for a burnt-offering unto the Lord. 
\v 13 And the meat-offering thereof shall be two tenth parts of fine flour mingled with oil, as an offering made by fire unto the Lord, for a sweet savor; with its drink-offering of wine, the fourth part of a hin. 
\v 14 And neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears, shall ye eat, until the self-same day, until ye have brought the offering of your God: it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings. 
\v 15 And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the holy day, from the day that ye bring the omer of the wave-offering, [that] it be seven complete weeks: 
\v 16 Even unto the morrow after the seventh week shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall then offer a new meat-offering unto the Lord. 
\v 17 Out of your own habitations shall ye bring two wave-loaves of two tenth parts; of fine flour shall they be; leavened shall they be baked; they are the first-fruits unto the Lord. 
\v 18 And ye shall offer with the bread seven sheep without blemish of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be for a burnt-offering unto the Lord, with their meat-offering, with their drink-offerings, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto the Lord. 
\v 19 And ye shall sacrifice one he-goat for a sin-offering, and two sheep of the first year for a sacrifice of peace-offering. 
\v 20 And the priest shall make with them together with the bread of the first-fruits a waving before the Lord, together with the two sheep; holy shall they be to the Lord for the priest. 
\v 21 And ye shall proclaim on the self-same day, that it may be a holy convocation unto you; no servile work shall ye do; it shall be a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations. 
\v 22 And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not cut away altogether the corners of thy field when thou reapest, and the gleaning of thy harvest shalt thou not gather up; unto the poor, and to the stranger shalt thou leave them: I am the Lord your God. 
\v 23 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 24 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, shall ye have a rest, a [day of] memorial of sounding the cornet, a holy convocation. 
\v 25 No servile work shall ye do: and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord. 
\v 26 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 27 But on the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of atonement, a holy convocation shall it be unto you, and ye shall fast; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord. 
\v 28 And no manner of work shall ye do on this same day; for it is a day of atonement, to make an atonement for you before the Lord your God. 
\v 29 For whatsoever person it be that fasteth not on this same day, shall be cut off from among his people. 
\v 30 And if there be any person that doth any work on this same day, then will I destroy the same person from among his people. 
\v 31 No manner of work shall ye do: it shall he a statute for ever throughout your generations, in all your dwellings. 
\v 32 A sabbath of rest it shall be unto you, and ye shall fast: on the ninth day of the month at evening [shall ye begin], from evening unto evening shall ye celebrate your sabbath. 
\v 33 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 34 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, On the fifteenth day of this seventh month, shall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto the Lord. 
\v 35 On the first day shall be a holy convocation; no servile work shall ye do. 
\v 36 Seven days shall ye offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord: on the eighth day shall be a holy convocation unto you; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord, it is a solemn assembly; no servile work shall ye do. 
\v 37 These are the feasts of the Lord, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord, burnt-offering, and meat-offering, sacrifice, and drink-offerings, every thing upon its day: 
\v 38 Beside the sabbaths of the Lord, and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill-offerings, which ye may give unto the Lord. 
\v 39 But on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruit of the land, shall ye keep the feast of the Lord seven days: on the first day shall be a rest, and on the eighth day shall be a rest. 
\v 40 And ye shall take unto yourselves on the first day the fruit of the tree hadar, branches of palm-trees, and the boughs of the myrtle-tree, and willows of the brook: and ye shall rejoice before the Lord your God seven days. 
\v 41 And ye shall keep it as a feast unto the Lord seven days in the year: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations; in the seventh month shall ye celebrate it. 
\v 42 In booths shall ye dwell seven days; all that are Israelites born shall dwell in booths. 
\v 43 In order that your generations may know, that I caused the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God. 
\v 44 And Moses declared the feasts of the Lord unto the children of Israel. 
\c 24  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure beaten olive-oil, for the lighting, to cause the lamp to burn continually. 
\v 3 Without the vail of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the congregation, shall Aaron put it in order [for] from evening unto morning before the Lord continually; as a statute for ever in your generations. 
\v 4 Upon the pure candlestick shall be put in order the lamps, before the Lord, continually. 
\v 5 And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake thereof twelve cakes: of two tenth parts shall each one cake be. 
\v 6 And thou shalt place them in two rows, six in a row, upon the pure table before the Lord. 
\v 7 And thou shalt put upon each row pure frankincense, that it may be unto the bread for a memorial, as a fire-offering unto the Lord. 
\v 8 On every and each sabbath day shall he place it in order before the Lord continually, [obtained] from the children of Israel as an everlasting covenant. 
\v 9 And it shall belong to Aaron and to his sons; and they shall eat it in a holy place; for it is most holy unto him, from the fire-offerings of the Lord, as a perpetual fixed portion. 
\v 10 And there went forth a son of an Israelitish woman, but who was the son of an Egyptian man, among the children of Israel; and there quarrelled together in the camp this son of the Israelitish woman and an Israelitish man. 
\v 11 And the son of the Israelitish woman pronounced the [holy] Name, and blasphemed; and they brought him unto Moses: [and his mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan;] 
\v 12 And they placed him in ward, until the decision of the Lord could be explained to them. 
\v 13 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 14 Lead forth the blasphemer to without the camp; and all that have heard him shall lay their hands upon his head; and all the congregation shall stone him. 
\v 15 And unto the children of Israel shalt thou speak, saying, Whatsoever man that blasphemeth his God shall bear his sin. 
\v 16 But he that pronounced the name of the Lord [with blasphemy] shall be put to death, all the congregation shall stone him; be he a stranger, or be he one that is born in the land, when he pronounceth the [holy] Name [with blasphemy,] he shall be put to death. 
\v 17 And he that taketh the life of any man shall surely be put to death. 
\v 18 And he that taketh the life of a beast shall make it good: beast for beast. 
\v 19 And if a man cause a bodily defect in his neighbor, as he hath done, so shall be done to him; 
\v 20 Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: in the manner as he hath caused a bodily defect in a man, so shall it be done to him. 
\v 21 And he that killeth a beast, shall make restitution for it; and he that killeth a man, shall be put to death. 
\v 22 One manner of judicial law shall ye have, the stranger shall be equal with one of your own country; for I am the Lord your God. 
\v 23 And Moses spoke to the children of Israel; and they led forth the blasphemer to without the camp, and they stoned him with stones; and the children of Israel did as the Lord had commanded Moses. 
\c 25  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spoke unto Moses on mount Sinai, saying, 
\v 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give unto you; then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the Lord. 
\v 3 Six years shalt thou sow thy field, and six years shalt thou prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof; 
\v 4 But in the seventh year there shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath [in honor] of the Lord: thy field shalt thou not sow, and thy vineyard shalt thou not prune. 
\v 5 That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest shalt thou not reap, and the grapes of thy undressed vine shalt thou not gather: a year of rest shall it be unto the land. 
\v 6 And [the product of] the sabbath of the land shall be unto you for food, for thee, and for thy man-servant, and for thy maid-servant, and for thy hired laborer, and for thy stranger, that sojourn with thee; 
\v 7 And for thy cattle, and for the beasts that are in thy land, shall all its products be [left] for food. 
\v 8 And thou shalt number unto thee seven sabbaths of years, seven years seven times; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years. 
\v 9 And then shalt thou cause the sound of the cornet to be heard, in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month: on the day of atonement shall ye sound the cornet throughout all your land. 
\v 10 And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim freedom throughout the land unto all the inhabitants thereof; it shall be a jubilee unto you; and ye shall return, every man, unto his possession, and ye shall return, every man, unto his family. 
\v 11 A jubilee shall this, the fiftieth year, be unto you: ye shall not sow, nor reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather in it the fruit of the undressed vines. 
\v 12 For it is the jubilee; holy shall it be unto you: from the field shall ye eat the products thereof. 
\v 13 In this year of the jubilee shall ye return, every man, unto his possession. 
\v 14 And if thou sell aught unto thy neighbor, or buy aught of thy neighbor's hand, ye shall not overreach one the other; 
\v 15 According to the number of years after the jubilee shalt thou buy of thy neighbor, according unto the number of harvest-years shall he sell unto thee; 
\v 16 According to the multitude of years shalt thou increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years shalt thou diminish the price thereof; for a number of harvests doth he sell unto thee. 
\v 17 And ye shall not overreach one the other; but thou shalt be afraid of thy God; for I am the Lord your God. 
\v 18 And ye shall do my statutes, and my ordinances shall ye keep and do them; and then shall ye dwell in the land in safety. 
\v 19 And the land shall yield its fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell in safety therein. 
\v 20 And if ye should say, What shall we eat in the seventh year? behold, we are not permitted to sow, and we cannot gather in our harvest: 
\v 21 Then will I command my blessing unto you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth a harvest for three years. 
\v 22 And when ye sow in the eighth year, then shall ye eat yet of the old harvest; until the ninth year, until its harvest come in, shall ye eat of the old store. 
\v 23 And the land shall not be sold for a permanence [to the purchaser]; for the land is mine; for strangers and sojourners are ye with me. 
\v 24 And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land. 
\v 25 If thy brother become poor, and sell away some of his possession: then may his nearest of kin come and redeem what his brother hath sold. 
\v 26 And if the man have none to redeem it, and he acquire the means, sufficient to be able to redeem it himself: 
\v 27 Then let him reckon the years since his sale, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; and so shall he return unto his possession. 
\v 28 But if his means do not suffice to enable him to restore it to him: then shall that which he hath sold remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of the jubilee; and it shall be freed in the jubilee, and he shall return unto his possession. 
\v 29 And if a man sell a dwelling-house in a walled city: then shall the time of redemption last till the end of the year of his sale; a full year shall his time of redemption last. 
\v 30 And if it be not redeemed within the expiration of a full year: then shall the house which is in the walled city remain as a permanence to him that bought it throughout his generations; it shall not become freed in the jubilee. 
\v 31 But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they shall have the right of redemption, and they shall become freed in the jubilee. 
\v 32 And [respecting] the cities of the Levites, the houses of the cities of their possession, a perpetual right of redemption shall belong to the Levites. 
\v 33 And if a man of the Levites redeem something: then shall the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, become freed in the jubilee; for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel. 
\v 34 And a field of the suburbs of their cities shall not be sold; for a perpetual possession is it unto them. 
\v 35 And if thy brother become poor, and fall in decay with thee: then shalt thou assist him, [yea] a stranger, or a sojourner, that he may live with thee. 
\v 36 Thou shalt not take of him any usury or increase; but thou shalt be afraid of thy God: that thy brother may live with thee. 
\v 37 Thy money shalt thou not give him upon usury, nor lend him thy victuals for increase. 
\v 38 I am the Lord your God, who have brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give unto you the land of Canaan, to be unto you a God. 
\v 39 And if thy brother become poor near thee, and be sold unto thee: thou shalt not compel him to work as a bond-servant. 
\v 40 But as a hired laborer, as a sojourner, shall he be with thee; until the year of the jubilee shall he serve with thee: 
\v 41 And then shall he depart from thee, he and his children with him; and he shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return. 
\v 42 For my servants are they, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bond-men are sold. 
\v 43 Thou shalt not rule over him with rigor; but thou shalt have fear of thy God. 
\v 44 But thy bond-man, and thy bond-woman that shall remain thine, shall be of the nations that are round about you; of them may ye buy bond-man and bond-woman. 
\v 45 And also of the children of the strangers that sojourn with you, of them may ye buy, and of their families that are with you, which they have begotten in your land; and they shall remain to you as a possession. 
\v 46 And ye may transfer them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them for a possession; you may hold them to service for ever; but over your brethren the children of Israel, one over the other, ye shall not rule with rigor. 
\v 47 And if a stranger or sojourner wax rich near thee, and thy brother become poor near him, and he sell himself unto the sojourning stranger near thee, or to a descendant of a stranger's family: 
\v 48 After he hath sold himself shall he have the right of redemption; one of his brethren may redeem him. 
\v 49 Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or any that is near of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he obtain the means, he may redeem himself. 
\v 50 And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he sold himself to him unto the year of the jubilee: and the price of his sale shall be according to the number of years, as the time of a hired laborer shall he have been with him. 
\v 51 If there be yet many years, according to them shall he return the price of his redemption out of his purchase-money. 
\v 52 And if there remain but few years unto the year of the jubilee: then shall he reckon with him; according to his years shall he return the price of his redemption. 
\v 53 As a laborer hired from year to year shall he be with him; he shall not rule over him with rigor before thy eyes. 
\v 54 And if he be not redeemed by [one of] these means: then shall he go out in the year of the jubilee, both he, and his children with him. 
\v 55 For unto me are the children of Israel servants, my servants are they, whom I have brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am the Eternal your God. 
\c 26  
\p
\v 1 Ye shall not make yourselves any idols, and a graven image, or a standing image shall ye not rear up unto you, and any carved stone shall you not place in your land, to bow down upon it; for I am the Eternal your God. 
\v 2 My sabbaths shall ye keep, and my sanctuary shall ye reverence: I am the Lord. 
\v 3 If in my statutes ye walk, and if my commandments ye keep, and do them: 
\v 4 Then will I give you rains in their due season, and the earth shall yield her products, and the tree of the field shall yield its fruit. 
\v 5 And the threshing shall reach with you unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto sowing-time; and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and ye shall dwell in safety in your land. 
\v 6 And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, with none to make you afraid; and I will remove evil beasts out of the land, and the sword shall not pass through your land. 
\v 7 And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword. 
\v 8 And five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand; and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword. 
\v 9 And I will turn myself unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you; and I will establish my covenant with you. 
\v 10 And ye shall eat very old store, and the old shall ye remove away because of the new. 
\v 11 And I will set my dwelling among you; and my soul shall not loath you. 
\v 12 And I will walk among you, and I will be to you a God, and ye shall be to me a people. 
\v 13 I am the Eternal your God, who have brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bond-men; and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and caused you to walk upright. 
\v 14 But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments; 
\v 15 And if my statutes ye despise, and if my ordinances your soul loath, so as not to do all my commandments, in that ye break my covenant: 
\v 16 Then will I also do this unto you, and I will inflict on you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart; and ye shall sow in vain your seed, for your enemies shall eat it. 
\v 17 And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be struck down before your enemies: and they that hate you shall bear rule over you; and ye shall flee while there is no one pursuing you. 
\v 18 And if with these things even ye will not yet hearken unto me: then will I chastise you yet more, sevenfold for your sins. 
\v 19 And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as copper: 
\v 20 And in vain shall your strength be spent; for your land shall not yield her products, and the tree of the land shall not yield its fruit. 
\v 21 And if ye walk yet contrary unto me, and if you refuse to hearken unto me: then will I bring more plagues upon you, sevenfold according to your sins. 
\v 22 And I will send out against you the beasts of the field, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and diminish yourselves; so that your roads shall be desolate. 
\v 23 And if notwithstanding these things ye will not be reformed by me, and walk contrary unto me: 
\v 24 Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and I also will punish you, sevenfold for your sins. 
\v 25 And I will bring over you the sword, avenging the quarrel of my covenant, so that ye shall be gathered together within your cities; and then will I send the pestilence among you, that ye shall deliver yourselves into the hand of the enemy; 
\v 26 When I break unto you the staff of bread; and ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver your bread again by weight; and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied. 
\v 27 And if notwithstanding this ye will not hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me: 
\v 28 Then will I also walk contrary unto you in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you, sevenfold for your sins. 
\v 29 And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat. 
\v 30 And I will destroy your high-places, and cut down your sun-images, and cast your carcasses upon the carcasses of your idols; and my soul shall loath you. 
\v 31 And I will render your cities a waste, and I will make desolate your sanctuaries, and I will not smell the savor of your sweet odors. 
\v 32 And I will surely make desolate the land: and your enemies who dwell therein shall be astonished at it. 
\v 33 And you will I scatter among the nations, and I will draw out after you the sword; and your land shall be a desolate wild, and your cities shall be a waste. 
\v 34 Then shall the land satisfy its sabbaths, all the days of its desolation, when ye are in the land of your enemies: then shall the land rest, and satisfy its sabbaths. 
\v 35 All the days of its desolation shall it rest, the time which it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it. 
\v 36 And regarding those that are left of you, I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a leaf shaken shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from the sword; and they shall fall with none pursuing. 
\v 37 And they shall stumble one over the other, as before the sword, without one pursuing: and ye shall have no power to stand up before your enemies. 
\v 38 And ye shall be lost among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall consume you. 
\v 39 And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in the land of your enemies; and also through the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them. 
\v 40 And they shall then confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, [that] through their trespass which they trespassed against me, and also that [because] they had walked contrary unto me: 
\v 41 I also had to walk contrary unto them, and to bring them into the land of their enemies; and then shall their uncircumcised heart be humbled, and then shall they satisfy their iniquity. 
\v 42 And I will then remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and the land will I remember. 
\v 43 For the land shall be forsaken by them, and shall satisfy its sabbaths, while it lieth desolate without them, and they shall satisfy their iniquity; because, even because my ordinances they despised, and my statutes their soul loathed. 
\v 44 And yet for all that, though they be in the land of their enemies, will I not cast them away, neither will I loath them, to destroy them utterly, to break my covenant with them; for I am the Lord their God. 
\v 45 But I will remember for their sakes the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt before the eyes of the nations, that I might be unto them a God: I am the Lord. 
\v 46 These are the statutes and ordinances and laws, which the Lord made between him and the children of Israel on mount Sinai, by the hand of Moses. 
\c 27  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If a man make a particular vow, [to give] the estimated value of persons in honor of the Lord: 
\v 3 If the estimated value concern a male from twenty years old, and unto sixty years old, then shall the estimation be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary. 
\v 4 And if it be a female, then shall the estimation be thirty shekels. 
\v 5 And if [the person be] from five years old and unto twenty years old, then shall the estimation of the male be twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels. 
\v 6 And if [the person be] from a month old and unto five years old, then shall the estimation of the male be five shekels of silver, and for the female the estimation [shall be] three shekels of silver. 
\v 7 And if [the person be] from sixty years old and upward, if it be a male, then shall the estimation be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels. 
\v 8 But if he be too poor for this estimation, then shall he present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to the ability to pay of him that hath vowed shall the priest value him. 
\v 9 And if it he a beast, whereof men can bring an offering unto the Lord, all that a man giveth of such unto the Lord shall be holy. 
\v 10 He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad one, or a bad for a good one; and if he should change beast for beast, then shall it together with its exchange be holy. 
\v 11 And if it be any unclean beast, of which they cannot offer a sacrifice unto the Lord, then shall he present the beast before the priest: 
\v 12 And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad; as the priest valueth it, so shall it be. 
\v 13 And if he will redeem it, then shall he add a fifth part thereof unto the estimated value. 
\v 14 And if a man sanctify his house as holy unto the Lord, then shall the priest value it, whether it be good or bad; as the priest may value it, so shall it stand. 
\v 15 And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then shall he add the fifth part of the money of the estimated value unto it, and it shall remain his. 
\v 16 And if a man sanctify some part of a field of his possession unto the Lord, then shall the estimation be in proportion to its required seed: the seed of a chomer of barley at fifty shekels of silver. 
\v 17 If immediately after the year of the jubilee he sanctify his field, according to this estimation shall it stand. 
\v 18 But if after the jubilee he sanctify his field, then shall the priest reckon unto him the money in proportion to the years that remain, until the year of the jubilee, and it shall be deducted from the estimation. 
\v 19 And if he that sanctified the field will redeem it, then shall he add the fifth part of the money of the estimated value unto it, and it shall be assured to him. 
\v 20 But if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more. 
\v 21 But the field, when it is freed in the jubilee, shall be holy unto the Lord, as a devoted field: to the priest shall it belong as his possession. 
\v 22 And if a man sanctify a field which he hath bought, which is not of the fields of his possession, unto the Lord: 
\v 23 Then shall the priest reckon unto him the amount of the estimated value to the year of the jubilee; and he shall give this estimation on that day, as a holy thing unto the Lord. 
\v 24 In the year of the jubilee the field shall return unto him of whom he bought it, to the one to whom belongeth the possession of the land. 
\v 25 And all estimations of value shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary; twenty gerahs shall be the shekel. 
\v 26 Only the first-born which shall, by being first born, be sacred unto the Lord among cattle, no man shall sanctify; whether it be ox, or lamb, it is the Lord's. 
\v 27 And if it be an unclean animal, then shall he redeem it according to the estimated value, and he shall add its fifth part thereto; and if it be not redeemed, then shall it be sold according to the estimated value. 
\v 28 But any devoted thing, which a man may devote unto the Lord of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall not be sold nor redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy unto the Lord. 
\v 29 Any one condemned, who shall be condemned to death among men, shall not be redeemed: he shall be put to death. 
\v 30 And every tithe of the land, of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, belongeth to the Lord; it is holy unto the Lord. 
\v 31 And if a man will redeem any part of his tithe, its fifth part shall he add thereto. 
\v 32 And concerning the tithe of the herds, or of the flocks, whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the Lord. 
\v 33 He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he should change it, then both it and the exchange thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed. 
\v 34 These are the commandments, which the Lord commanded Moses for the children on mount Sinai.
