\mt1 THE SONG OF SOLOMON. 
\c 1  
\m
\v 1  \sc The\sc* song of songs, which \add is\add* Solomon’s. 
\q1
\v 2 Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: 
\q1 For thy love \add is\add* better than wine. 
\q1
\v 3 Because of the savour of thy good ointments 
\q1 Thy name \add is as\add* ointment poured forth, 
\q1 Therefore do the virgins love thee. 
\q1
\v 4 Draw me, we will run after thee: 
\q1 The king hath brought me \add into\add* his chambers: 
\q1 We will be glad and rejoice in thee, 
\q1 We will remember thy love more than wine: 
\q1 The upright love thee. 
\q1
\v 5 I \add am\add* black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, 
\q1 As the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon. 
\q1
\v 6 Look not upon me, because I \add am\add* black, 
\q1 Because the sun hath looked upon me: 
\q1 My mother’s children were angry with me; 
\q1 They made me the keeper of the vineyards; 
\q1 \add But\add* mine own vineyard have I not kept. 
\q1
\v 7 Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, 
\q1 Where thou feedest, where thou makest \add thy flock\add* to rest at noon: 
\q1 For why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions? 
\b
\q1
\v 8 If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, 
\q1 Go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, 
\q1 And feed thy kids beside the shepherds’ tents. 
\q1
\v 9 I have compared thee, O my love, 
\q1 To a company of horses in Pharaoh’s chariots. 
\q1
\v 10 Thy cheeks are comely with rows \add of jewels\add*, 
\q1 Thy neck with chains \add of gold\add*. 
\q1
\v 11 We will make thee borders of gold 
\q1 With studs of silver. 
\b
\q1
\v 12 While the king \add sitteth\add* at his table, 
\q1 My spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof. 
\q1
\v 13 A bundle of myrrh \add is\add* my well-beloved unto me; 
\q1 He shall lie all night betwixt my breasts. 
\q1
\v 14 My beloved \add is\add* unto me \add as\add* a cluster of camphire 
\q1 In the vineyards of En-gedi. 
\q1
\v 15 Behold, thou \add art\add* fair, my love; behold, thou \add art\add* fair; 
\q1 Thou \add hast\add* doves’ eyes. 
\b
\q1
\v 16 Behold, thou \add art\add* fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: 
\q1 Also our bed \add is\add* green. 
\q1
\v 17 The beams of our house \add are\add* cedar, 
\q1 \add And\add* our rafters of fir. 
\b
\c  2  
\q1
\v 1 I am the rose of Sharon, 
\q1 \add And\add* the lily of the valleys. 
\b
\q1
\v 2 As the lily among thorns, 
\q1 So \add is\add* my love among the daughters. 
\b
\q1
\v 3 As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, 
\q1 So \add is\add* my beloved among the sons. 
\q1 I sat down under his shadow with great delight, 
\q1 And his fruit \add was\add* sweet to my taste. 
\q1
\v 4 He brought me to the banqueting house, 
\q1 And his banner over me \add was\add* love. 
\q1
\v 5 Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: 
\q1 For I \add am\add* sick of love. 
\q1
\v 6 His left hand \add is\add* under my head, 
\q1 And his right hand doth embrace me. 
\q1
\v 7 I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, 
\q1 By the roes, and by the hinds of the field, 
\q1 That ye stir not up, nor awake \add my\add* love, till he please. 
\b
\q1
\v 8 The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh 
\q1 Leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills. 
\q1
\v 9 My beloved \add is\add* like a roe or a young hart: 
\q1 Behold, he standeth behind our wall, 
\q1 He looketh forth at the windows, 
\q1 Shewing himself through the lattice. 
\q1
\v 10 My beloved spake, and said unto me, 
\q1 Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away. 
\q1
\v 11 For lo, the winter is past, 
\q1 The rain is over \add and\add* gone; 
\q1
\v 12 The flowers appear on the earth; 
\q1 The time of the singing \add of birds\add* is come, 
\q1 And the voice of the turtle is heard in our land; 
\q1
\v 13 The fig tree putteth forth her green figs, 
\q1 And the vines \add with\add* the tender grape give a \add good\add* smell. 
\q1 Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. 
\q1
\v 14 O my dove, \add that art\add* in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, 
\q1 Let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; 
\q1 For sweet \add is\add* thy voice, and thy countenance \add is\add* comely. 
\q1
\v 15 Take us the foxes, 
\q1 The little foxes, that spoil the vines: 
\q1 For our vines \add have\add* tender grapes. 
\q1
\v 16 My beloved \add is\add* mine, and I \add am\add* his: 
\q1 He feedeth among the lilies. 
\q1
\v 17 Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, 
\q1 Turn, my beloved, 
\q1 And be thou like a roe or a young hart 
\q1 Upon the mountains of Bether. 
\b
\c  3  
\q1
\v 1 By night on my bed I sought \add him\add* whom my soul loveth: 
\q1 I sought him, but I found him not. 
\q1
\v 2 I will rise now, and go about the city 
\q1 In the streets and in the broad ways, 
\q1 I will seek \add him\add* whom my soul loveth: 
\q1 I sought him, but I found him not. 
\q1
\v 3 The watchmen that go about the city found me: 
\q1 \add To whom I said\add*, Saw ye \add him\add* whom my soul loveth? 
\q1
\v 4  \add It was\add* but a little that I passed from them, 
\q1 But I found \add him\add* whom my soul loveth: 
\q1 I held him, and would not let him go, 
\q1 Until I had brought him into my mother’s house, 
\q1 And into the chamber of her that conceived me. 
\q1
\v 5 I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, 
\q1 By the roes, and by the hinds of the field, 
\q1 That ye stir not up, nor awake \add my\add* love, till he please. 
\b
\q1
\v 6 Who \add is\add* this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke, 
\q1 Perfumed \add with\add* myrrh and frankincense, 
\q1 With all powders of the merchant? 
\q1
\v 7 Behold his bed, which \add is\add* Solomon’s; 
\q1 Threescore valiant \add men are\add* about it, 
\q1 Of the valiant of Israel. 
\q1
\v 8 They all hold swords, \add being\add* expert in war: 
\q1 Every man \add hath\add* his sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night. 
\q1
\v 9 King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon. 
\q1
\v 10 He made the pillars thereof \add of\add* silver, 
\q1 The bottom thereof \add of\add* gold, 
\q1 The covering of it \add of\add* purple, 
\q1 The midst thereof being paved \add with\add* love, for the daughters of Jerusalem. 
\q1
\v 11 Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon 
\q1 With the crown where\add with\add* his mother crowned him 
\q1 In the day of his espousals, 
\q1 And in the day of the gladness of his heart. 
\b
\c  4  
\q1
\v 1 Behold, thou \add art\add* fair, my love; behold, thou \add art\add* fair; 
\q1 Thou \add hast\add* doves’ eyes within thy locks: 
\q1 Thy hair \add is\add* as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead. 
\q1
\v 2 Thy teeth \add are\add* like a flock of \add sheep that are\add* even shorn, which came up from the washing; 
\q1 Whereof every one beareth twins, and none \add is\add* barren among them. 
\q1
\v 3 Thy lips \add are\add* like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech \add is\add* comely: 
\q1 Thy temples \add are\add* like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks. 
\q1
\v 4 Thy neck \add is\add* like the tower of David 
\q1 Builded for an armoury, 
\q1 Whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty \add men\add*. 
\q1
\v 5 Thy two breasts \add are\add* like two young roes \add that are\add* twins, 
\q1 Which feed among the lilies. 
\b
\q1
\v 6 Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, 
\q1 I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense. 
\b
\q1
\v 7 Thou \add art\add* all fair, my love; \add there is\add* no spot in thee. 
\q1
\v 8 Come with me from Lebanon, \add my\add* spouse, with me from Lebanon: 
\q1 Look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, 
\q1 From the lions’ dens, from the mountains of the leopards. 
\q1
\v 9 Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, \add my\add* spouse; 
\q1 Thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, 
\q1 With one chain of thy neck. 
\q1
\v 10 How fair is thy love, my sister, \add my\add* spouse! 
\q1 How much better is thy love than wine! 
\q1 And the smell of thine ointments than all spices! 
\q1
\v 11 Thy lips, O \add my\add* spouse, drop \add as\add* the honeycomb: 
\q1 Honey and milk \add are\add* under thy tongue; 
\q1 And the smell of thy garments \add is\add* like the smell of Lebanon. 
\q1
\v 12 A garden inclosed \add is\add* my sister, \add my\add* spouse; 
\q1 A spring shut up, a fountain sealed. 
\q1
\v 13 Thy plants \add are\add* an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; 
\q1 Camphire, with spikenard, 
\q1
\v 14 Spikenard and saffron; 
\q1 Calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; 
\q1 Myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices: 
\q1
\v 15 A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, 
\q1 And streams from Lebanon. 
\b
\q1
\v 16 Awake, O north wind; and come thou south; 
\q1 Blow upon my garden, \add that\add* the spices thereof may flow out. 
\q1 Let my beloved come into his garden, 
\q1 And eat his pleasant fruits. 
\b
\c  5  
\q1
\v 1 I am come into my garden, my sister, \add my\add* spouse: 
\q1 I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; 
\q1 I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; 
\q1 I have drunk my wine with my milk: 
\q1 Eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved. 
\b
\q1
\v 2 I sleep, but my heart waketh: 
\q1 \add It is\add* the voice of my beloved that knocketh \add saying\add*, 
\q1 Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: 
\q1 For my head is filled \add with\add* dew, 
\q1 \add And\add* my locks \add with\add* the drops of the night. 
\q1
\v 3 I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? 
\q1 I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them? 
\q1
\v 4 My beloved put in his hand by the hole \add of the door\add*, 
\q1 And my bowels were moved for him. 
\q1
\v 5 I rose up to open to my beloved; 
\q1 And my hands dropped \add with\add* myrrh, 
\q1 And my fingers \add with\add* sweet smelling myrrh, 
\q1 Upon the handles of the lock. 
\q1
\v 6 I opened to my beloved; 
\q1 But my beloved had withdrawn himself, \add and\add* was gone: 
\q1 My soul failed when he spake: 
\q1 I sought him, but I could not find him; 
\q1 I called him, but he gave me no answer. 
\q1
\v 7 The watchmen that went about the city found me, 
\q1 They smote me, they wounded me; 
\q1 The keepers of the walls took away my vail from me. 
\q1
\v 8 I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, 
\q1 If ye find my beloved, that ye tell him, 
\q1 That I \add am\add* sick of love. 
\b
\q1
\v 9 What \add is\add* thy beloved more than \add another\add* beloved, O thou fairest among women? 
\q1 What \add is\add* thy beloved more than \add another\add* beloved, that thou dost so charge us? 
\b
\q1
\v 10 My beloved \add is\add* white and ruddy, 
\q1 The chiefest among ten thousand. 
\q1
\v 11 His head \add is as\add* the most fine gold, 
\q1 His locks \add are\add* bushy, \add and\add* black as a raven. 
\q1
\v 12 His eyes \add are\add* as \add the eyes of\add* doves by the rivers of waters, 
\q1 Washed with milk, \add and\add* fitly set. 
\q1
\v 13 His cheeks \add are\add* as a bed of spices, \add as\add* sweet flowers: 
\q1 His lips \add like\add* lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh. 
\q1
\v 14 His hands \add are as\add* gold rings set with the beryl: 
\q1 His belly \add is as\add* bright ivory overlaid \add with\add* sapphires. 
\q1
\v 15 His legs \add are as\add* pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: 
\q1 His countenance \add is\add* as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars. 
\q1
\v 16 His mouth \add is\add* most sweet: yea, he \add is\add* altogether lovely. 
\q1 This \add is\add* my beloved, and this \add is\add* my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem. 
\b
\c  6  
\q1
\v 1 Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? 
\q1 Whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with thee. 
\b
\q1
\v 2 My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, 
\q1 To feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies. 
\q1
\v 3 I \add am\add* my beloved’s, and my beloved \add is\add* mine: 
\q1 He feedeth among the lilies. 
\b
\q1
\v 4 Thou \add art\add* beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, 
\q1 Comely as Jerusalem, 
\q1 Terrible as \add an army\add* with banners. 
\q1
\v 5 Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: 
\q1 Thy hair \add is\add* as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead. 
\q1
\v 6 Thy teeth \add are\add* as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, 
\q1 Whereof every one beareth twins, and \add there is\add* not one barren among them. 
\q1
\v 7 As a piece of a pomegranate \add are\add* thy temples within thy locks. 
\q1
\v 8 There \add are\add* threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, 
\q1 And virgins without number. 
\q1
\v 9 My dove, my undefiled \add is but\add* one; 
\q1 She \add is\add* the \add only\add* one of her mother, 
\q1 She \add is\add* the choice one of her that bare her. 
\q1 The daughters saw her, and blessed her; 
\q1 \add Yea\add*, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her. 
\b
\q1
\v 10 Who \add is\add* she that looketh forth as the morning, 
\q1 Fair as the moon, clear as the sun, 
\q1 \add And\add* terrible as \add an army\add* with banners? 
\b
\q1
\v 11 I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, 
\q1 \add And\add* to see whether the vine flourished, \add and\add* the pomegranates budded. 
\q1
\v 12 Or ever I was aware, 
\q1 My soul made me \add like\add* the chariots of Ammi-nadib. 
\b
\q1
\v 13 Return, return, O Shulamite; 
\q1 Return, return, that we may look upon thee. 
\b
\q1 What will ye see in the Shulamite? 
\b
\q1 As it were the company of two armies. 
\b
\c  7  
\q1
\v 1 How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince’s daughter! 
\q1 The joints of thy thighs \add are\add* like jewels, 
\q1 The work of the hands of a cunning workman. 
\q1
\v 2 Thy navel \add is like\add* a round goblet, \add which\add* wanteth not liquor: 
\q1 Thy belly \add is like\add* a heap of wheat set about with lilies. 
\q1
\v 3 Thy two breasts \add are\add* like two young roes \add that are\add* twins. 
\q1
\v 4 Thy neck \add is\add* as a tower of ivory; 
\q1 Thine eyes \add like\add* the \add fish\add*pools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim: 
\q1 Thy nose \add is\add* as the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus. 
\q1
\v 5 Thine head upon thee \add is\add* like Carmel, 
\q1 And the hair of thine head like purple; 
\q1 The king \add is\add* held in the galleries. 
\q1
\v 6 How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights! 
\q1
\v 7 This thy stature is like to a palm tree, 
\q1 And thy breasts to clusters \add of grapes\add*. 
\q1
\v 8 I said, I will go up to the palm tree, 
\q1 I will take hold of the boughs thereof: 
\q1 Now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine, 
\q1 And the smell of thy nose like apples; 
\q1
\v 9 And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine, 
\q1 For my beloved, that goeth \add down\add* sweetly, 
\q1 Causing the lips of \add those that are\add* asleep to speak. 
\b
\q1
\v 10 I \add am\add* my beloved’s, and his desire \add is\add* towards me. 
\q1
\v 11 Come, my beloved, let us go forth \add into\add* the field; 
\q1 Let us lodge in the villages. 
\q1
\v 12 Let us get up early to the vineyards; 
\q1 Let us see if the vine flourish, \add whether\add* the tender grape appear, 
\q1 \add And\add* the pomegranates bud forth: 
\q1 There will I give thee my loves. 
\q1
\v 13 The mandrakes give a smell, 
\q1 And at our gates \add are\add* all \add manner of\add* pleasant \add fruits\add*, 
\q1 New and old, 
\q1 \add Which\add* I have laid up for thee, O my beloved. 
\c 8  
\q1
\v 1 O that thou \add wert\add* as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother! 
\q1 \add When\add* I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; 
\q1 Yea, I should not be despised. 
\q1
\v 2 I would lead thee, \add and\add* bring thee into my mother’s house, \add who\add* would instruct me: 
\q1 I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine, of the juice of my pomegranate. 
\q1
\v 3 His left hand \add should be\add* under my head, 
\q1 And his right hand should embrace me. 
\q1
\v 4 I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, 
\q1 That ye stir not up, nor awake \add my\add* love, until he please. 
\b
\q1
\v 5 Who \add is\add* this that cometh up from the wilderness, 
\q1 Leaning upon her beloved? 
\q1 I raised thee up under the apple tree: 
\q1 There thy mother brought thee forth: 
\q1 There she brought \add thee\add* forth \add that\add* bare thee. 
\q1
\v 6 Set me as a seal upon thine heart, 
\q1 As a seal upon thine arm: 
\q1 For love \add is\add* strong as death; 
\q1 Jealousy \add is\add* cruel as the grave: 
\q1 The coals thereof \add are\add* coals of fire, 
\q1 \add Which hath\add* a most vehement flame. 
\q1
\v 7 Many waters cannot quench love, 
\q1 Neither can the floods drown it: 
\q1 If a man would give all the substance of his house for love, 
\q1 It would utterly be contemned. 
\q1
\v 8 We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: 
\q1 What shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for? 
\q1
\v 9 If she \add be\add* a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: 
\q1 And if she \add be\add* a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar. 
\b
\q1
\v 10 I \add am\add* a wall, and my breasts like towers: 
\q1 Then was I in his eyes as one that found favour. 
\q1
\v 11 Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; 
\q1 He let out the vineyard unto keepers; 
\q1 Every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand \add pieces\add* of silver. 
\b
\q1
\v 12 My vineyard, which \add is\add* mine, \add is\add* before me: 
\b
\q1 Thou, O Solomon, \add must have\add* a thousand, 
\q1 And those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred. 
\b
\q1
\v 13 Thou that dwellest in the gardens, 
\q1 The companions hearken to thy voice: 
\q1 Cause me to hear \add it\add*. 
\b
\q1
\v 14 Make haste, my beloved, 
\q1 And be thou like to a roe or to a young hart 
\q1 Upon the mountains of spices.
