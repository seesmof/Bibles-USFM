\mt1 THE BOOK OF JOB. 
\c 1  
\m
\v 1  \sc There\sc* was a man in the land of Uz, whose name \add was\add* Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil. 
\v 2 And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters. 
\v 3 His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east. 
\v 4 And his sons went and feasted \add in their\add* houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them. 
\v 5 And it was so, when the days of \add their\add* feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings \add according to\add* the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually. 
\p
\v 6 Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the \sc Lord\sc*, and Satan came also among them. 
\v 7 And the \sc Lord\sc* said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the \sc Lord\sc*, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it. 
\v 8 And the \sc Lord\sc* said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that \add there is\add* none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? 
\v 9 Then Satan answered the \sc Lord\sc*, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought? 
\v 10 Hast not thou made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land. 
\v 11 But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face. 
\v 12 And the \sc Lord\sc* said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath \add is\add* in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\p
\v 13 And there was a day when his sons and his daughters \add were\add* eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house: 
\v 14 and there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them: 
\v 15 and the Sabeans fell \add upon them\add*, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. 
\v 16 While he \add was\add* yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burnt up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. 
\v 17 While he \add was\add* yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. 
\v 18 While he \add was\add* yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters \add were\add* eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house: 
\v 19 and behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. 
\v 20 Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped, 
\v 21 and said, 
\q1 Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, 
\q1 And naked shall I return thither: 
\q1 The \sc Lord\sc* gave, and the \sc Lord\sc* hath taken \add away;\add* 
\q1 Blessed be the name of the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\m
\v 22 In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the \sc Lord\sc*, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\v 2 And the \sc Lord\sc* said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the \sc Lord\sc*, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it. 
\v 3 And the \sc Lord\sc* said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that \add there is\add* none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause. 
\v 4 And Satan answered the \sc Lord\sc*, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life. 
\v 5 But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face. 
\v 6 And the \sc Lord\sc* said unto Satan, Behold, he \add is\add* in thine hand; but save his life. 
\v 7 So went Satan forth from the presence of the \sc Lord\sc*, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown. 
\v 8 And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes. 
\v 9 Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die. 
\v 10 But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish \add women\add* speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips. 
\p
\v 11 Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him. 
\v 12 And when they lift up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven. 
\v 13 So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that \add his\add* grief was very great. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day. 
\v 2 And Job spake, and said, 
\q1
\v 3 Let the day perish wherein I was born, 
\q1 And the night \add in which it was\add* said, There is a man child conceived. 
\q1
\v 4 Let that day be darkness; 
\q1 Let not God regard it from above, 
\q1 Neither let the light shine upon it. 
\q1
\v 5 Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; 
\q1 Let a cloud dwell upon it; 
\q1 Let the blackness of the day terrify it. 
\b
\q1
\v 6  \add As for\add* that night, let darkness seize upon it; 
\q1 Let it not be joined unto the days of the year, 
\q1 Let it not come into the number of the months. 
\q1
\v 7 Lo, let that night be solitary, 
\q1 Let no joyful voice come therein. 
\q1
\v 8 Let them curse it that curse the day, 
\q1 Who are ready to raise up their mourning. 
\q1
\v 9 Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; 
\q1 Let it look for light, but \add have\add* none; 
\q1 Neither let it see the dawning of the day: 
\b
\q1
\v 10 Because it shut not up the doors of my \add mother’s\add* womb, 
\q1 Nor hid sorrow from mine eyes. 
\q1
\v 11 Why died I not from the womb? 
\q1 \add Why\add* did I \add not\add* give up the ghost when I came out of the belly? 
\q1
\v 12 Why did the knees prevent me? 
\q1 Or why the breasts that I should suck? 
\b
\q1
\v 13 For now should I have lien \add still\add* and been quiet, 
\q1 I should have slept: then had I been at rest, 
\q1
\v 14 With kings and counsellers of the earth, 
\q1 Which built desolate places for themselves; 
\q1
\v 15 Or with princes that had gold, 
\q1 Who filled their houses \add with\add* silver: 
\q1
\v 16 Or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been; 
\q1 As infants \add which\add* never saw light. 
\b
\q1
\v 17 There the wicked cease \add from\add* troubling; 
\q1 And there the weary be at rest. 
\q1
\v 18  \add There\add* the prisoners rest together; 
\q1 They hear not the voice of the oppressor. 
\q1
\v 19 The small and great \add are\add* there; 
\q1 And the servant \add is\add* free from his master. 
\b
\q1
\v 20 Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, 
\q1 And life unto the bitter in soul; 
\q1
\v 21 Which long for death, but it \add cometh\add* not; 
\q1 And dig for it more than for hid treasures; 
\q1
\v 22 Which rejoice exceedingly, 
\q1 \add And\add* are glad, when they can find the grave? 
\q1
\v 23  \add Why is light given\add* to a man whose way is hid, 
\q1 And whom God hath hedged in? 
\b
\q1
\v 24 For my sighing cometh before I eat, 
\q1 And my roarings are poured out like the waters. 
\q1
\v 25 For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, 
\q1 And \add that\add* which I was afraid of is come unto me. 
\q1
\v 26 I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; 
\q1 Yet trouble came. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, 
\q1
\v 2  \add If we\add* assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? 
\q1 But who can withhold himself from speaking? 
\q1
\v 3 Behold, thou hast instructed many, 
\q1 And thou hast strengthened the weak hands. 
\q1
\v 4 Thy words have upholden him that was falling, 
\q1 And thou hast strengthened the feeble knees. 
\q1
\v 5 But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; 
\q1 It toucheth thee, and thou art troubled. 
\b
\q1
\v 6  \add Is\add* not \add this\add* thy fear, thy confidence, 
\q1 Thy hope; and the uprightness of thy ways? 
\q1
\v 7 Remember, I pray thee, who \add ever\add* perished, being innocent? 
\q1 Or where were the righteous cut off? 
\q1
\v 8 Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, 
\q1 And sow wickedness, reap the same. 
\q1
\v 9 By the blast of God they perish, 
\q1 And by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed. 
\q1
\v 10 The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, 
\q1 And the teeth of the young lions, are broken. 
\q1
\v 11 The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, 
\q1 And the stout lion’s whelps are scattered abroad. 
\b
\q1
\v 12 Now a thing was secretly brought to me, 
\q1 And mine ear received a little thereof. 
\q1
\v 13 In thoughts from the visions of the night, 
\q1 When deep sleep falleth on men. 
\q1
\v 14 Fear came upon me, and trembling, 
\q1 Which made all my bones to shake. 
\q1
\v 15 Then a spirit passed before my face; 
\q1 The hair of my flesh stood up: 
\q1
\v 16 It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: 
\q1 An image \add was\add* before mine eyes, 
\q1 \add There was\add* silence, and I heard a voice, \add saying\add*, 
\b
\q1
\v 17 Shall mortal man be more just than God? 
\q1 Shall a man be more pure than his Maker? 
\q1
\v 18 Behold, he put no trust in his servants; 
\q1 And his angels he charged with folly: 
\q1
\v 19 How much less \add in\add* them that dwell in houses of clay, 
\q1 Whose foundation \add is\add* in the dust, 
\q1 Which are crushed before the moth? 
\q1
\v 20 They are destroyed from morning to evening: 
\q1 They perish for ever without \add any\add* regarding \add it\add*. 
\q1
\v 21 Doth not their excellency \add which is\add* in them go away? 
\q1 They die, even without wisdom. 
\b
\c  5  
\q1
\v 1 Call now, if there be \add any\add* that will answer thee; 
\q1 And to which of the saints wilt thou turn? 
\q1
\v 2 For wrath killeth the foolish man, 
\q1 And envy slayeth the silly one. 
\q1
\v 3 I have seen the foolish taking root: 
\q1 But suddenly I cursed his habitation. 
\q1
\v 4 His children are far from safety, 
\q1 And they are crushed in the gate, neither \add is there\add* any to deliver \add them\add*. 
\q1
\v 5 Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, 
\q1 And taketh it \add even\add* out of the thorns, 
\q1 And the robber swalloweth up their substance. 
\b
\q1
\v 6 Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, 
\q1 Neither doth trouble spring out of the ground; 
\q1
\v 7 Yet man is born unto trouble, 
\q1 As the sparks fly upward. 
\q1
\v 8 I would seek unto God, 
\q1 And unto God would I commit my cause: 
\q1
\v 9 Which doeth great \add things\add* and unsearchable; 
\q1 Marvellous \add things\add* without number: 
\q1
\v 10 Who giveth rain upon the earth, 
\q1 And sendeth waters upon the fields: 
\q1
\v 11 To set up on high those that be low; 
\q1 That those which mourn may be exalted \add to\add* safety. 
\b
\q1
\v 12 He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, 
\q1 So that their hands cannot perform \add their\add* enterprise. 
\q1
\v 13 He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: 
\q1 And the counsel of the froward is carried headlong. 
\q1
\v 14 They meet with darkness in the daytime, 
\q1 And grope in the noonday as in the night. 
\q1
\v 15 But he saveth the poor from the sword, 
\q1 From their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty. 
\q1
\v 16 So the poor hath hope, 
\q1 And iniquity stoppeth her mouth. 
\b
\q1
\v 17 Behold, happy \add is\add* the man whom God correcteth: 
\q1 Therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty: 
\q1
\v 18 For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: 
\q1 He woundeth, and his hands make whole. 
\q1
\v 19 He shall deliver thee in six troubles: 
\q1 Yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee. 
\q1
\v 20 In famine he shall redeem thee from death: 
\q1 And in war from the power of the sword. 
\q1
\v 21 Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: 
\q1 Neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh. 
\b
\q1
\v 22 At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: 
\q1 Neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth. 
\q1
\v 23 For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: 
\q1 And the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee. 
\q1
\v 24 And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle \add shall be in\add* peace; 
\q1 And thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin. 
\q1
\v 25 Thou shalt know also that thy seed \add shall be\add* great, 
\q1 And thine offspring as the grass of the earth. 
\q1
\v 26 Thou shalt come to \add thy\add* grave in a full age, 
\q1 Like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season. 
\b
\q1
\v 27 Lo this, we have searched it, so it \add is;\add* 
\q1 Hear it, and know thou \add it\add* for thy good. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1 But Job answered and said, 
\q1
\v 2 Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, 
\q1 And my calamity laid in the balances together! 
\q1
\v 3 For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: 
\q1 Therefore my words are swallowed up. 
\q1
\v 4 For the arrows of the Almighty \add are\add* within me, 
\q1 The poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: 
\q1 The terrors of God do set \add themselves\add* in array \add against\add* me. 
\b
\q1
\v 5 Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? 
\q1 Or loweth the ox over his fodder? 
\q1
\v 6 Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? 
\q1 Or is there \add any\add* taste in the white of an egg? 
\q1
\v 7 The things \add that\add* my soul refused to touch 
\q1 \add Are\add* as my sorrowful meat. 
\b
\q1
\v 8 O that I might have my request; 
\q1 And \add that\add* God would grant \add me\add* the thing that I long for! 
\q1
\v 9 Even \add that\add* it would please God to destroy me: 
\q1 \add That\add* he would let loose his hand, and cut me off! 
\q1
\v 10 Then should I yet have comfort; 
\q1 Yea, I would harden myself in sorrow; let him not spare: 
\q1 For I have not concealed the words of the Holy One. 
\b
\q1
\v 11 What \add is\add* my strength, that I should hope? 
\q1 And what \add is\add* mine end, that I should prolong my life? 
\q1
\v 12  \add Is\add* my strength the strength of stones? 
\q1 Or \add is\add* my flesh of brass? 
\q1
\v 13  \add Is\add* not my help in me? 
\q1 And is wisdom driven \add quite\add* from me? 
\b
\q1
\v 14 To him that is afflicted pity \add should be shewed\add* from his friend; 
\q1 But he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty. 
\q1
\v 15 My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, 
\q1 \add And\add* as the stream of brooks they pass away; 
\q1
\v 16 Which are blackish by reason of the ice, 
\q1 \add And\add* wherein the snow is hid: 
\q1
\v 17 What time they wax warm, they vanish: 
\q1 When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place. 
\q1
\v 18 The paths of their way are turned aside; 
\q1 They go to nothing, and perish. 
\q1
\v 19 The troops of Tema looked, 
\q1 The companies of Sheba waited for them. 
\q1
\v 20 They were confounded because they had hoped; 
\q1 They came thither, and were ashamed. 
\b
\q1
\v 21 For now ye are nothing; 
\q1 Ye see \add my\add* casting down, and are afraid. 
\q1
\v 22 Did I say, Bring unto me? 
\q1 Or, Give a reward for me of your substance? 
\q1
\v 23 Or, Deliver me from the enemy’s hand? 
\q1 Or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty? 
\b
\q1
\v 24 Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: 
\q1 And cause me to understand wherein I have erred. 
\q1
\v 25 How forcible are right words! 
\q1 But what doth your arguing reprove? 
\q1
\v 26 Do ye imagine to reprove words, 
\q1 And the speeches of one that is desperate, \add which are\add* as wind? 
\q1
\v 27 Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, 
\q1 And you dig \add a pit\add* for your friend. 
\b
\q1
\v 28 Now therefore be content, look upon me; 
\q1 For \add it is\add* evident unto you if I lie. 
\q1
\v 29 Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; 
\q1 Yea, return again, my righteousness \add is\add* in it. 
\q1
\v 30 Is there iniquity in my tongue? 
\q1 Cannot my taste discern perverse things? 
\b
\c  7  
\q1
\v 1  \add Is there\add* not an appointed time to man upon earth? 
\q1 \add Are not\add* his days also like the days of a hireling? 
\q1
\v 2 As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, 
\q1 And as a hireling looketh for the reward of his work: 
\q1
\v 3 So am I made to possess months of vanity, 
\q1 And wearisome nights are appointed to me. 
\b
\q1
\v 4 When I lie down, I say, 
\q1 When shall I arise, and the night be gone? 
\q1 And I am full \add of\add* tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day. 
\q1
\v 5 My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; 
\q1 My skin is broken, and become loathsome. 
\q1
\v 6 My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle, 
\q1 And are spent without hope. 
\b
\q1
\v 7 O remember that my life \add is\add* wind: 
\q1 Mine eye shall no more see good. 
\q1
\v 8 The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no \add more:\add* 
\q1 Thine eyes \add are\add* upon me, and I \add am\add* not. 
\q1
\v 9  \add As\add* the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: 
\q1 So he that goeth down \add to\add* the grave shall come up no \add more\add*. 
\q1
\v 10 He shall return no more to his house, 
\q1 Neither shall his place know him any more. 
\q1
\v 11 Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; 
\q1 I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; 
\q1 I will complain in the bitterness of my soul. 
\b
\q1
\v 12  \add Am\add* I a sea, or a whale, 
\q1 That thou settest a watch over me? 
\q1
\v 13 When I say, My bed shall comfort me, 
\q1 My couch shall ease my complaint; 
\q1
\v 14 Then thou scarest me with dreams, 
\q1 And terrifiest me through visions: 
\q1
\v 15 So that my soul chooseth strangling, 
\q1 \add And\add* death rather than my life. 
\q1
\v 16 I loathe \add it;\add* I would not live alway: 
\q1 Let me alone; for my days \add are\add* vanity. 
\b
\q1
\v 17 What \add is\add* man, that thou shouldest magnify him? 
\q1 And that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him? 
\q1
\v 18 And \add that\add* thou shouldest visit him every morning, 
\q1 \add And\add* try him every moment? 
\q1
\v 19 How long wilt thou not depart from me, 
\q1 Nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle? 
\b
\q1
\v 20 I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, 
\q1 O thou preserver of men? 
\q1 Why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, 
\q1 So that I am a burden to myself? 
\q1
\v 21 And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, 
\q1 And take away mine iniquity? 
\q1 For now shall I sleep in the dust; 
\q1 And thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I \add shall\add* not \add be\add*. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 
\q1
\v 2 How long wilt thou speak these \add things?\add* 
\q1 And \add how long shall\add* the words of thy mouth \add be like\add* a strong wind? 
\q1
\v 3 Doth God pervert judgment? 
\q1 Or doth the Almighty pervert justice? 
\q1
\v 4 If thy children have sinned against him, 
\q1 And he have cast them away for their transgression; 
\q1
\v 5 If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, 
\q1 And make thy supplication to the Almighty; 
\q1
\v 6 If thou \add wert\add* pure and upright; 
\q1 Surely now he would awake for thee, 
\q1 And make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous. 
\q1
\v 7 Though thy beginning was small, 
\q1 Yet thy latter end should greatly increase. 
\b
\q1
\v 8 For inquire, I pray thee, of the former age, 
\q1 And prepare \add thyself\add* to the search of their fathers: 
\q1
\v 9 (For we \add are but of\add* yesterday, and know nothing, 
\q1 Because our days upon earth \add are\add* a shadow:) 
\q1
\v 10 Shall not they teach thee, \add and\add* tell thee, 
\q1 And utter words out of their heart? 
\b
\q1
\v 11 Can the rush grow up without mire? 
\q1 Can the flag grow without water? 
\q1
\v 12 Whilst it \add is\add* yet in his greenness, \add and\add* not cut down, 
\q1 It withereth before any \add other\add* herb. 
\q1
\v 13 So \add are\add* the paths of all that forget God; 
\q1 And the hypocrite’s hope shall perish: 
\q1
\v 14 Whose hope shall be cut off, 
\q1 And whose trust \add shall be\add* a spider’s web. 
\q1
\v 15 He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: 
\q1 He shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure. 
\q1
\v 16 He \add is\add* green before the sun, 
\q1 And his branch shooteth forth in his garden, 
\q1
\v 17 His roots are wrapped about the heap, 
\q1 \add And\add* seeth the place of stones. 
\q1
\v 18 If he destroy him from his place, 
\q1 Then \add it\add* shall deny him, \add saying\add*, I have not seen thee. 
\q1
\v 19 Behold, this \add is\add* the joy of his way, 
\q1 And out of the earth shall others grow. 
\b
\q1
\v 20 Behold, God will not cast away a perfect \add man\add*, 
\q1 Neither will he help the evil doers: 
\q1
\v 21 Till he fill thy mouth \add with\add* laughing, 
\q1 And thy lips \add with\add* rejoicing. 
\q1
\v 22 They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; 
\q1 And the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 Then Job answered and said, 
\q1
\v 2 I know \add it is\add* so of a truth: 
\q1 But how should man be just with God? 
\q1
\v 3 If he will contend with him, 
\q1 He cannot answer him one of a thousand. 
\q1
\v 4  \add He is\add* wise in heart, and mighty in strength: 
\q1 Who hath hardened \add himself\add* against him, and hath prospered? 
\b
\q1
\v 5 Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: 
\q1 Which overturneth them in his anger. 
\q1
\v 6 Which shaketh the earth out of her place, 
\q1 And the pillars thereof tremble. 
\q1
\v 7 Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; 
\q1 And sealeth up the stars. 
\b
\q1
\v 8 Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, 
\q1 And treadeth upon the waves of the sea. 
\q1
\v 9 Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, 
\q1 And Pleiades, and the chambers of the south. 
\q1
\v 10 Which doeth great \add things\add* past finding out; 
\q1 Yea, and wonders without number. 
\b
\q1
\v 11 Lo, he goeth by me, and I see \add him\add* not: 
\q1 He passeth on also, but I perceive him not. 
\q1
\v 12 Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? 
\q1 Who will say unto him, What doest thou? 
\q1
\v 13  \add If\add* God will not withdraw his anger, 
\q1 The proud helpers do stoop under him. 
\q1
\v 14 How much less shall I answer him, 
\q1 \add And\add* choose out my words \add to reason\add* with him? 
\q1
\v 15 Whom, though I were righteous, \add yet\add* would I not answer, 
\q1 \add But\add* I would make supplication to my judge. 
\b
\q1
\v 16 If I had called, and he had answered me; 
\q1 \add Yet\add* would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice. 
\q1
\v 17 For he breaketh me with a tempest, 
\q1 And multiplieth my wounds without cause. 
\q1
\v 18 He will not suffer me to take my breath, 
\q1 But filleth me \add with\add* bitterness. 
\q1
\v 19 If \add I speak\add* of strength, lo, \add he is\add* strong: 
\q1 And if of judgment, who shall set me a time \add to plead?\add* 
\q1
\v 20 If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: 
\q1 \add If I say,\add* I \add am\add* perfect, it shall also prove me perverse. 
\q1
\v 21  \add Though\add* I \add were\add* perfect, \add yet\add* would I not know my soul: 
\q1 I would despise my life. 
\q1
\v 22 This \add is\add* one \add thing\add*, therefore I said \add it\add*, 
\q1 He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked. 
\q1
\v 23 If the scourge slay suddenly, 
\q1 He will laugh at the trial of the innocent. 
\q1
\v 24 The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: 
\q1 He covereth the faces of the judges thereof; 
\q1 If not, where, \add and\add* who \add is\add* he? 
\b
\q1
\v 25 Now my days are swifter than a post: 
\q1 They flee away, they see no good. 
\q1
\v 26 They are passed away as the swift ships: 
\q1 As the eagle \add that\add* hasteth to the prey. 
\q1
\v 27 If I say, I will forget my complaint, 
\q1 I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort myself: 
\q1
\v 28 I am afraid of all my sorrows, 
\q1 I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent. 
\b
\q1
\v 29  \add If\add* I be wicked, 
\q1 Why then labour I in vain? 
\q1
\v 30 If I wash myself with snow water, 
\q1 And make my hands never so clean; 
\q1
\v 31 Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, 
\q1 And mine own clothes shall abhor me. 
\q1
\v 32 For \add he is\add* not a man, as I \add am, that\add* I should answer him, 
\q1 \add And\add* we should come together in judgment. 
\q1
\v 33 Neither is there \add any\add* daysman betwixt us, 
\q1 \add That\add* might lay his hand upon us both. 
\q1
\v 34 Let him take his rod away from me, 
\q1 And let not his fear terrify me: 
\q1
\v 35  \add Then\add* would I speak, and not fear him; 
\q1 But \add it is\add* not so with me. 
\b
\c  10  
\q1
\v 1 My soul is weary of my life; 
\q1 I will leave my complaint upon myself; 
\q1 I will speak in the bitterness of my soul. 
\q1
\v 2 I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; 
\q1 Shew me wherefore thou contendest with me. 
\q1
\v 3  \add Is it\add* good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, 
\q1 That thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, 
\q1 And shine upon the counsel of the wicked? 
\q1
\v 4 Hast thou eyes of flesh? 
\q1 Or seest thou as man seeth? 
\q1
\v 5  \add Are\add* thy days as the days of man? 
\q1 \add Are\add* thy years as man’s days, 
\q1
\v 6 That thou inquirest after mine iniquity, 
\q1 And searchest after my sin? 
\q1
\v 7 Thou knowest that I am not wicked; 
\q1 And \add there is\add* none that can deliver out of thine hand. 
\b
\q1
\v 8 Thine hands have made me and fashioned me 
\q1 Together round about; yet thou dost destroy me. 
\q1
\v 9 Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; 
\q1 And wilt thou bring me into dust again? 
\q1
\v 10 Hast thou not poured me out as milk, 
\q1 And cruddled me like cheese? 
\q1
\v 11 Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, 
\q1 And hast fenced me with bones and sinews. 
\q1
\v 12 Thou hast granted me life and favour, 
\q1 And thy visitation hath preserved my spirit. 
\b
\q1
\v 13 And these \add things\add* hast thou hid in thine heart: 
\q1 I know that this \add is\add* with thee. 
\q1
\v 14 If I sin, then thou markest me, 
\q1 And thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity. 
\q1
\v 15 If I be wicked, woe unto me; 
\q1 And \add if\add* I be righteous, \add yet\add* will I not lift up my head. 
\q1 \add I am\add* full of confusion; therefore see thou mine affliction; 
\q1
\v 16 For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: 
\q1 And again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me. 
\q1
\v 17 Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, 
\q1 And increasest thine indignation upon me; 
\q1 Changes and war \add are\add* against me. 
\b
\q1
\v 18 Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? 
\q1 \add Oh that\add* I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me! 
\q1
\v 19 I should have been as though I had not been; 
\q1 I should have been carried from the womb to the grave. 
\q1
\v 20  \add Are\add* not my days few? cease then, 
\q1 And let me alone, that I may take comfort a little, 
\q1
\v 21 Before I go whence I shall not return, 
\q1 \add Even\add* to the land of darkness and the shadow of death; 
\q1
\v 22 A land of darkness, as darkness itself; 
\q1 \add And of\add* the shadow of death, without any order, 
\q1 And \add where\add* the light is as darkness. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, 
\q1
\v 2 Should not the multitude of words be answered? 
\q1 And should a man full of talk be justified? 
\q1
\v 3 Should thy lies make men hold their peace? 
\q1 And when thou mockest, shall no man make \add thee\add* ashamed? 
\q1
\v 4 For thou hast said, My doctrine \add is\add* pure, 
\q1 And I am clean in thine eyes. 
\q1
\v 5 But O that God would speak, 
\q1 And open his lips against thee; 
\q1
\v 6 And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, 
\q1 That \add they are\add* double to that which is. 
\q1 Know therefore that God exacteth of thee \add less\add* than thine iniquity \add deserveth\add*. 
\b
\q1
\v 7 Canst thou \add by\add* searching find out God? 
\q1 Canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection? 
\q1
\v 8  \add It is\add* as high as heaven; what canst thou do? 
\q1 Deeper than hell; what canst thou know? 
\q1
\v 9 The measure thereof \add is\add* longer than the earth, 
\q1 And broader than the sea. 
\b
\q1
\v 10 If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, 
\q1 Then who can hinder him? 
\q1
\v 11 For he knoweth vain men: 
\q1 He seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider \add it?\add* 
\q1
\v 12 For vain man would be wise, 
\q1 Though man be born \add like\add* a wild ass’s colt. 
\b
\q1
\v 13 If thou prepare thine heart, 
\q1 And stretch out thine hands toward him; 
\q1
\v 14 If iniquity \add be\add* in thine hand, put it far away, 
\q1 And let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles. 
\q1
\v 15 For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; 
\q1 Yea, thou shalt be steadfast, and shalt not fear. 
\b
\q1
\v 16 Because thou shalt forget \add thy\add* misery, 
\q1 \add And\add* remember \add it\add* as waters \add that\add* pass away: 
\q1
\v 17 And \add thine\add* age shall be clearer than the noonday; 
\q1 Thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning. 
\q1
\v 18 And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; 
\q1 Yea, thou shalt dig \add about thee, and\add* thou shalt take thy rest in safety. 
\q1
\v 19 Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make \add thee\add* afraid; 
\q1 Yea, many shall make suit unto thee. 
\q1
\v 20 But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, 
\q1 And they shall not escape, 
\q1 And their hope \add shall be as\add* the giving up of the ghost. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 And Job answered and said, 
\q1
\v 2 No doubt but ye \add are\add* the people, 
\q1 And wisdom shall die with you. 
\q1
\v 3 But I have understanding as well as you; 
\q1 I \add am\add* not inferior to you: 
\q1 Yea, who knoweth not such \add things\add* as these? 
\b
\q1
\v 4 I am \add as\add* one mocked of his neighbour, 
\q1 Who calleth upon God, and he answereth him: 
\q1 The just upright \add man is\add* laughed to scorn. 
\q1
\v 5 He that is ready to slip with \add his\add* feet 
\q1 \add Is as\add* a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease. 
\q1
\v 6 The tabernacles of robbers prosper, 
\q1 And they that provoke God are secure; 
\q1 Into whose hand God bringeth \add abundantly\add*. 
\b
\q1
\v 7 But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; 
\q1 And the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee: 
\q1
\v 8 Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: 
\q1 And the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee. 
\q1
\v 9 Who knoweth not in all these 
\q1 That the hand of the \sc Lord\sc* hath wrought this? 
\q1
\v 10 In whose hand \add is\add* the soul of every living \add thing\add*, 
\q1 And the breath of all mankind. 
\b
\q1
\v 11 Doth not the ear try words? 
\q1 And the mouth taste his meat? 
\q1
\v 12 With the ancient \add is\add* wisdom; 
\q1 And \add in\add* length of days understanding. 
\q1
\v 13 With him \add is\add* wisdom and strength, 
\q1 He hath counsel and understanding. 
\b
\q1
\v 14 Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built \add again:\add* 
\q1 He shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening. 
\q1
\v 15 Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: 
\q1 Also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth. 
\q1
\v 16 With him \add is\add* strength and wisdom: 
\q1 The deceived and the deceiver \add are\add* his. 
\b
\q1
\v 17 He leadeth counsellers away spoiled, 
\q1 And maketh the judges fools. 
\q1
\v 18 He looseth the bond of kings, 
\q1 And girdeth their loins with a girdle. 
\q1
\v 19 He leadeth princes away spoiled, 
\q1 And overthroweth the mighty. 
\q1
\v 20 He removeth away the speech of the trusty, 
\q1 And taketh \add away\add* the understanding of the aged. 
\q1
\v 21 He poureth contempt upon princes, 
\q1 And weakeneth the strength of the mighty. 
\b
\q1
\v 22 He discovereth deep \add things\add* out of darkness, 
\q1 And bringeth out to light the shadow of death. 
\q1
\v 23 He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: 
\q1 He enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them \add again\add*. 
\q1
\v 24 He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, 
\q1 And causeth them to wander in a wilderness \add where there is\add* no way. 
\q1
\v 25 They grope \add in\add* the dark without light, 
\q1 And he maketh them to stagger like a drunken \add man\add*. 
\b
\c  13  
\q1
\v 1 Lo, mine eye hath seen all \add this\add*, 
\q1 Mine ear hath heard and understood it. 
\q1
\v 2 What ye know, \add the same\add* do I know also. 
\q1 I \add am\add* not inferior unto you. 
\b
\q1
\v 3 Surely I would speak to the Almighty, 
\q1 And I desire to reason with God. 
\q1
\v 4 But ye \add are\add* forgers of lies, 
\q1 Ye \add are\add* all physicians of no value. 
\q1
\v 5 O that you would altogether hold your peace, 
\q1 And it should be your wisdom. 
\q1
\v 6 Hear now my reasoning, 
\q1 And hearken to the pleadings of my lips. 
\b
\q1
\v 7 Will you speak wickedly for God? 
\q1 And talk deceitfully for him? 
\q1
\v 8 Will ye accept his person? 
\q1 Will ye contend for God? 
\q1
\v 9  \add Is it\add* good that he should search you out? 
\q1 Or as \add one\add* man mocketh another, do ye \add so\add* mock him? 
\q1
\v 10 He will surely reprove you, 
\q1 If ye do secretly accept persons. 
\q1
\v 11 Shall not his excellency make you afraid? 
\q1 And his dread fall upon you? 
\b
\q1
\v 12 Your remembrances \add are\add* like unto ashes, 
\q1 Your bodies to bodies of clay. 
\q1
\v 13 Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, 
\q1 And let come on me what \add will\add*. 
\q1
\v 14 Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, 
\q1 And put my life in mine hand? 
\q1
\v 15 Though he slay me, \add yet\add* will I trust in him: 
\q1 But I will maintain mine own ways before him. 
\q1
\v 16 He also \add shall be\add* my salvation: 
\q1 For a hypocrite shall not come before him. 
\b
\q1
\v 17 Hear diligently my speech, 
\q1 And my declaration with your ears. 
\q1
\v 18 Behold now, I have ordered \add my\add* cause; 
\q1 I know that I shall be justified. 
\q1
\v 19 Who \add is\add* he \add that\add* will plead with me? 
\q1 For now, if I hold my tongue, I shall give up the ghost. 
\b
\q1
\v 20 Only do not two \add things\add* unto me: 
\q1 Then will I not hide myself from thee. 
\q1
\v 21 Withdraw thine hand far from me: 
\q1 And let not thy dread make me afraid. 
\q1
\v 22 Then call thou, and I will answer: 
\q1 Or let me speak, and answer thou me. 
\b
\q1
\v 23 How many \add are\add* mine iniquities and sins? 
\q1 Make me to know my transgression and my sin. 
\q1
\v 24 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, 
\q1 And holdest me for thine enemy? 
\q1
\v 25 Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? 
\q1 And wilt thou pursue the dry stubble? 
\b
\q1
\v 26 For thou writest bitter \add things\add* against me, 
\q1 And makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth. 
\q1
\v 27 Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, 
\q1 And lookest narrowly unto all my paths; 
\q1 Thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet. 
\q1
\v 28 And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, 
\q1 As a garment that is moth-eaten. 
\b
\c  14  
\q1
\v 1 Man \add that is\add* born of a woman 
\q1 \add Is\add* of few days, and full of trouble. 
\q1
\v 2 He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: 
\q1 He fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not. 
\q1
\v 3 And dost thou open thine eyes upon such a one, 
\q1 And bringest me into judgment with thee? 
\b
\q1
\v 4 Who can bring a clean \add thing\add* out of an unclean? 
\q1 Not one. 
\q1
\v 5 Seeing his days \add are\add* determined, 
\q1 The number of his months \add are\add* with thee, 
\q1 Thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass; 
\q1
\v 6 Turn from him, that he may rest, 
\q1 Till he shall accomplish, as a hireling, his day. 
\b
\q1
\v 7 For there is hope of a tree, 
\q1 If it be cut down, that it will sprout again, 
\q1 And that the tender branch thereof will not cease. 
\q1
\v 8 Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, 
\q1 And the stock thereof die in the ground; 
\q1
\v 9  \add Yet\add* through the sent of water it will bud, 
\q1 And bring forth boughs like a plant. 
\b
\q1
\v 10 But man dieth, and wasteth away: 
\q1 Yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where \add is\add* he? 
\q1
\v 11  \add As\add* the waters fail from the sea, 
\q1 And the flood decayeth and drieth up: 
\q1
\v 12 So man lieth down, and riseth not: 
\q1 Till the heavens \add be\add* no more, they shall not awake, 
\q1 Nor be raised out of their sleep. 
\b
\q1
\v 13 O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, 
\q1 That thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, 
\q1 That thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me. 
\q1
\v 14 If a man die, shall he live \add again?\add* 
\q1 All the days of my appointed time will I wait, 
\q1 Till my change come. 
\q1
\v 15 Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: 
\q1 Thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands. 
\q1
\v 16 For now thou numberest my steps: 
\q1 Dost thou not watch over my sin? 
\b
\q1
\v 17 My transgression \add is\add* sealed up in a bag, 
\q1 And thou sewest up mine iniquity. 
\q1
\v 18 And surely the mountain falling cometh to nought, 
\q1 And the rock is removed out of his place. 
\q1
\v 19 The waters wear the stones: 
\q1 Thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth; 
\q1 And thou destroyest the hope of man. 
\b
\q1
\v 20 Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: 
\q1 Thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away. 
\q1
\v 21 His sons come to honour, and he knoweth \add it\add* not; 
\q1 And they are brought low, but he perceiveth \add it\add* not of them. 
\q1
\v 22 But his flesh upon him shall have pain, 
\q1 And his soul within him shall mourn. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1 Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said, 
\q1
\v 2 Should a wise \add man\add* utter vain knowledge, 
\q1 And fill his belly \add with\add* the east wind? 
\q1
\v 3 Should he reason \add with\add* unprofitable talk? 
\q1 Or \add with\add* speeches wherewith he can do no good? 
\q1
\v 4 Yea, thou castest off fear, 
\q1 And restrainest prayer before God. 
\q1
\v 5 For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, 
\q1 And thou choosest the tongue of the crafty. 
\q1
\v 6 Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I; 
\q1 Yea, thine own lips testify against thee. 
\b
\q1
\v 7  \add Art\add* thou the first man \add that\add* was born? 
\q1 Or wast thou made before the hills? 
\q1
\v 8 Hast thou heard the secret of God? 
\q1 And dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself? 
\q1
\v 9 What knowest thou, that we know not? 
\q1 \add What\add* understandest thou, which \add is\add* not in us? 
\q1
\v 10 With us \add are\add* both the grayheaded and very aged men, 
\q1 Much elder than thy father. 
\b
\q1
\v 11  \add Are\add* the consolations of God small with thee? 
\q1 Is there \add any\add* secret thing with thee? 
\q1
\v 12 Why doth thine heart carry thee away? 
\q1 And what do thine eyes wink at, 
\q1
\v 13 That thou turnest thy spirit against God, 
\q1 And lettest \add such\add* words go out of thy mouth? 
\b
\q1
\v 14 What \add is\add* man, that he should be clean? 
\q1 And \add he which is\add* born of a woman, that he should be righteous? 
\q1
\v 15 Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; 
\q1 Yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight. 
\q1
\v 16 How much more abominable and filthy 
\q1 \add Is\add* man, which drinketh iniquity like water? 
\b
\q1
\v 17 I will shew thee, hear me; 
\q1 And that which I have seen I will declare; 
\q1
\v 18 Which wise \add men\add* have told 
\q1 From their fathers, and have not hid \add it:\add* 
\q1
\v 19 Unto whom alone the earth was given, 
\q1 And no stranger passed among them. 
\b
\q1
\v 20 The wicked \add man\add* travaileth with pain all his days, 
\q1 And the number of years is hidden to the oppressor. 
\q1
\v 21 A dreadful sound \add is\add* in his ears: 
\q1 In prosperity the destroyer shall come \add upon\add* him. 
\q1
\v 22 He believeth not that \add he\add* shall return out of darkness, 
\q1 And he \add is\add* waited for of the sword. 
\q1
\v 23 He wandereth abroad for bread, \add saying\add*, Where \add is it?\add* 
\q1 He knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand. 
\q1
\v 24 Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; 
\q1 \add They\add* shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle. 
\b
\q1
\v 25 For he stretcheth out his hand against God, 
\q1 And strengtheneth himself against the Almighty. 
\q1
\v 26 He runneth upon him, \add even\add* on \add his\add* neck, 
\q1 Upon the thick bosses of his bucklers: 
\q1
\v 27 Because he covereth his face with his fatness, 
\q1 And maketh collops of fat on \add his\add* flanks. 
\q1
\v 28 And he dwelleth in desolate cities, 
\q1 \add And\add* in houses which no man inhabiteth, 
\q1 Which are ready to become heaps. 
\q1
\v 29 He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, 
\q1 Neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth. 
\q1
\v 30 He shall not depart out of darkness; 
\q1 The flame shall dry up his branches, 
\q1 And by the breath of his mouth shall he go away. 
\b
\q1
\v 31 Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: 
\q1 For vanity shall be his recompence. 
\q1
\v 32 It shall be accomplished before his time, 
\q1 And his branch shall not be green. 
\q1
\v 33 He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, 
\q1 And shall cast off his flower as the olive. 
\q1
\v 34 For the congregation of hypocrites \add shall be\add* desolate, 
\q1 And fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery. 
\q1
\v 35 They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, 
\q1 And their belly prepareth deceit. 
\c 16  
\p
\v 1 Then Job answered and said, 
\q1
\v 2 I have heard many such \add things:\add* 
\q1 Miserable comforters \add are\add* ye all. 
\q1
\v 3 Shall vain words have an end? 
\q1 Or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest? 
\q1
\v 4 I also could speak as ye \add do:\add* 
\q1 If your soul were in my soul’s stead, 
\q1 I could heap up words against you, 
\q1 And shake mine head at you. 
\q1
\v 5  \add But\add* I would strengthen you with my mouth, 
\q1 And the moving of my lips should asswage \add your grief\add*. 
\b
\q1
\v 6 Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: 
\q1 And \add though\add* I forbear, what am I eased? 
\q1
\v 7 But now he hath made me weary: 
\q1 Thou hast made desolate all my company. 
\q1
\v 8 And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, \add which\add* is a witness \add against me:\add* 
\q1 And my leanness rising up in me 
\q1 Beareth witness to my face. 
\q1
\v 9 He teareth \add me in\add* his wrath, who hateth me: 
\q1 He gnasheth upon me with his teeth; 
\q1 Mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me. 
\b
\q1
\v 10 They have gaped upon me with their mouth; 
\q1 They have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; 
\q1 They have gathered themselves together against me. 
\q1
\v 11 God hath delivered me to the ungodly, 
\q1 And turned me over into the hands of the wicked. 
\q1
\v 12 I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: 
\q1 He hath also taken \add me\add* by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, 
\q1 And set me up for his mark. 
\q1
\v 13 His archers compass me round about, 
\q1 He cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; 
\q1 He poureth out my gall upon the ground. 
\q1
\v 14 He breaketh me \add with\add* breach upon breach, 
\q1 He runneth upon me like a giant. 
\b
\q1
\v 15 I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, 
\q1 And defiled my horn in the dust. 
\q1
\v 16 My face is foul with weeping, 
\q1 And on mine eyelids \add is\add* the shadow of death; 
\q1
\v 17 Not for \add any\add* injustice in mine hands: 
\q1 Also my prayer is pure. 
\q1
\v 18 O earth, cover not thou my blood, 
\q1 And let my cry have no place. 
\q1
\v 19 Also now, behold, my witness \add is\add* in heaven, 
\q1 And my record \add is\add* on high. 
\q1
\v 20 My friends scorn me: 
\q1 \add But\add* mine eye poureth out \add tears\add* unto God. 
\q1
\v 21 O that \add one\add* might plead for a man with God, 
\q1 As a man \add pleadeth\add* for his neighbour. 
\q1
\v 22 When a few years are come, 
\q1 Then I shall go the way \add whence\add* I shall not return. 
\b
\c  17  
\q1
\v 1 My breath is corrupt, 
\q1 My days are extinct, 
\q1 The graves \add are ready\add* for me. 
\q1
\v 2  \add Are there\add* not mockers with me? 
\q1 And \add doth not\add* mine eye continue in their provocation? 
\b
\q1
\v 3 Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; 
\q1 Who \add is\add* he \add that\add* will strike hands with me? 
\q1
\v 4 For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: 
\q1 Therefore shalt thou not exalt \add them\add*. 
\q1
\v 5 He \add that\add* speaketh flattery to \add his\add* friends, 
\q1 Even the eyes of his children shall fail. 
\b
\q1
\v 6 He hath made me also a byword of the people; 
\q1 And aforetime I was \add as\add* a tabret. 
\q1
\v 7 Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, 
\q1 And all my members \add are\add* as a shadow. 
\q1
\v 8 Upright \add men\add* shall be astonied at this, 
\q1 And the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite. 
\q1
\v 9 The righteous also shall hold on his way, 
\q1 And he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger. 
\q1
\v 10 But \add as for\add* you all, do you return, and come now: 
\q1 For I cannot find \add one\add* wise \add man\add* among you. 
\b
\q1
\v 11 My days are past, 
\q1 My purposes are broken off, 
\q1 \add Even\add* the thoughts of my heart. 
\q1
\v 12 They change the night into day: 
\q1 The light \add is\add* short, because of darkness. 
\q1
\v 13 If I wait, the grave \add is\add* mine house: 
\q1 I have made my bed in the darkness. 
\q1
\v 14 I have said to corruption, Thou \add art\add* my father: 
\q1 To the worm, \add Thou art\add* my mother, and my sister. 
\q1
\v 15 And where \add is\add* now my hope? 
\q1 As for my hope, who shall see it? 
\q1
\v 16 They shall go down \add to\add* the bars of the pit, 
\q1 When \add our\add* rest together \add is\add* in the dust. 
\c 18  
\p
\v 1 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 
\q1
\v 2 How long \add will it be ere\add* you make an end of words? 
\q1 Mark, and afterwards we will speak. 
\q1
\v 3 Wherefore are we counted as beasts, 
\q1 \add And\add* reputed vile in your sight? 
\b
\q1
\v 4 He teareth himself in his anger: 
\q1 Shall the earth be forsaken for thee? 
\q1 And shall the rock be removed out of his place? 
\q1
\v 5 Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, 
\q1 And the spark of his fire shall not shine. 
\q1
\v 6 The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, 
\q1 And his candle shall be put out with him. 
\q1
\v 7 The steps of his strength shall be straitened, 
\q1 And his own counsel shall cast him down. 
\b
\q1
\v 8 For he is cast into a net by his own feet, 
\q1 And he walketh upon a snare. 
\q1
\v 9 The grin shall take \add him\add* by the heel, 
\q1 \add And\add* the robber shall prevail against him. 
\q1
\v 10 The snare \add is\add* laid for him in the ground, 
\q1 And a trap for him in the way. 
\q1
\v 11 Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, 
\q1 And shall drive him to his feet. 
\b
\q1
\v 12 His strength shall be hunger-bitten, 
\q1 And destruction \add shall be\add* ready at his side. 
\q1
\v 13 It shall devour the strength of his skin: 
\q1 \add Even\add* the firstborn of death shall devour his strength. 
\q1
\v 14 His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, 
\q1 And it shall bring him to the king of terrors. 
\q1
\v 15 It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because \add it is\add* none of his: 
\q1 Brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation. 
\b
\q1
\v 16 His roots shall be dried up beneath, 
\q1 And above shall his branch be cut off. 
\q1
\v 17 His remembrance shall perish from the earth, 
\q1 And he shall have no name in the street. 
\q1
\v 18 He shall be driven from light into darkness, 
\q1 And chased out of the world. 
\q1
\v 19 He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, 
\q1 Nor \add any\add* remaining in his dwellings. 
\b
\q1
\v 20 They that come after \add him\add* shall be astonied at his day, 
\q1 As they that went before were affrighted. 
\q1
\v 21 Surely such \add are\add* the dwellings of the wicked, 
\q1 And this \add is\add* the place \add of him that\add* knoweth not God. 
\c 19  
\p
\v 1 Then Job answered and said, 
\q1
\v 2 How long will ye vex my soul, 
\q1 And break me in pieces with words? 
\q1
\v 3 These ten times have ye reproached me: 
\q1 You are not ashamed \add that\add* you make yourselves strange to me. 
\q1
\v 4 And be it indeed \add that\add* I have erred, 
\q1 Mine error remaineth with myself. 
\q1
\v 5 If indeed ye will magnify \add yourselves\add* against me, 
\q1 And plead against me my reproach: 
\q1
\v 6 Know now that God hath overthrown me, 
\q1 And hath compassed me with his net. 
\b
\q1
\v 7 Behold, I cry out \add of\add* wrong, but I am not heard: 
\q1 I cry aloud, but \add there is\add* no judgment. 
\q1
\v 8 He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, 
\q1 And he hath set darkness in my paths. 
\q1
\v 9 He hath stript me of my glory, 
\q1 And taken the crown \add from\add* my head. 
\q1
\v 10 He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: 
\q1 And mine hope hath he removed like a tree. 
\q1
\v 11 He hath also kindled his wrath against me, 
\q1 And he counteth me unto him as \add one of\add* his enemies. 
\q1
\v 12 His troops come together, 
\q1 And raise up their way against me, 
\q1 And encamp round about my tabernacle. 
\b
\q1
\v 13 He hath put my brethren far from me, 
\q1 And mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me. 
\q1
\v 14 My kinsfolk have failed, 
\q1 And my familiar friends have forgotten me. 
\q1
\v 15 They that dwell in mine house, and my maidens, 
\q1 Count me for a stranger: 
\q1 I am an alien in their sight. 
\q1
\v 16 I called my servant, and he gave \add me\add* no answer; 
\q1 I intreated him with my mouth. 
\q1
\v 17 My breath is strange to my wife, 
\q1 Though I intreated for the children’s \add sake\add* of mine \add own\add* body. 
\q1
\v 18 Yea, young children despised me; 
\q1 I arose, and they spake against me. 
\q1
\v 19 All my inward friends abhorred me: 
\q1 And they whom I loved are turned against me. 
\q1
\v 20 My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, 
\q1 And I am escaped with the skin of my teeth. 
\b
\q1
\v 21 Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; 
\q1 For the hand of God hath touched me. 
\q1
\v 22 Why do ye persecute me as God, 
\q1 And are not satisfied with my flesh? 
\b
\q1
\v 23 O that my words were now written! 
\q1 O that they were printed in a book! 
\q1
\v 24 That they were graven with an iron pen and lead 
\q1 In the rock for ever! 
\q1
\v 25 For I know \add that\add* my Redeemer liveth, 
\q1 And \add that\add* he shall stand \add at\add* the latter \add day\add* upon the earth: 
\q1
\v 26 And \add though\add* after my skin \add worms\add* destroy this \add body\add*, 
\q1 Yet in my flesh shall I see God: 
\q1
\v 27 Whom I shall see for myself, 
\q1 And mine eyes shall behold, and not another; 
\q1 \add Though\add* my reins be consumed within me. 
\b
\q1
\v 28 But ye should say, Why persecute we him? 
\q1 Seeing the root of the matter is found in me; 
\q1
\v 29 Be ye afraid of the sword: 
\q1 For wrath \add bringeth\add* the punishments of the sword, 
\q1 That ye may know \add there is\add* a judgment. 
\c 20  
\p
\v 1 Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, 
\q1
\v 2 Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, 
\q1 And for \add this\add* I make haste. 
\q1
\v 3 I have heard the check of my reproach, 
\q1 And the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer. 
\q1
\v 4 Knowest thou \add not\add* this of old, 
\q1 Since man was placed upon earth, 
\q1
\v 5 That the triumphing of the wicked \add is\add* short, 
\q1 And the joy of the hypocrite \add but\add* for a moment? 
\b
\q1
\v 6 Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, 
\q1 And his head reach unto the clouds; 
\q1
\v 7  \add Yet\add* he shall perish for ever like his own dung: 
\q1 They which have seen him shall say, Where \add is\add* he? 
\q1
\v 8 He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: 
\q1 Yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night. 
\q1
\v 9 The eye also \add which\add* saw him shall \add see him\add* no more; 
\q1 Neither shall his place any more behold him. 
\q1
\v 10 His children shall \add seek to\add* please the poor, 
\q1 And his hands shall restore their goods. 
\q1
\v 11 His bones are full \add of the sin of\add* his youth, 
\q1 Which shall lie down with him in the dust. 
\b
\q1
\v 12 Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, 
\q1 \add Though\add* he hide it under his tongue; 
\q1
\v 13  \add Though\add* he spare it, and forsake it not; 
\q1 But keep it still within his mouth: 
\q1
\v 14  \add Yet\add* his meat in his bowels is turned, 
\q1 \add It is\add* the gall of asps within him. 
\q1
\v 15 He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: 
\q1 God shall cast them out of his belly. 
\q1
\v 16 He shall suck the poison of asps: 
\q1 The viper’s tongue shall slay him. 
\b
\q1
\v 17 He shall not see the rivers, 
\q1 The floods, the brooks of honey and butter. 
\q1
\v 18 That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow \add it\add* down: 
\q1 According to \add his\add* substance \add shall\add* the restitution \add be\add*, and he shall not rejoice \add therein\add*. 
\q1
\v 19 Because he hath oppressed \add and\add* hath forsaken the poor; 
\q1 \add Because\add* he hath violently taken away a house which he builded not; 
\q1
\v 20 Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, 
\q1 He shall not save of that which he desired. 
\b
\q1
\v 21  \add There shall\add* none of his meat \add be\add* left; 
\q1 Therefore shall no \add man\add* look for his goods. 
\q1
\v 22 In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: 
\q1 Every hand of the wicked shall come \add upon\add* him. 
\q1
\v 23  \add When\add* he is about to fill his belly, 
\q1 \add God\add* shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, 
\q1 And shall rain \add it\add* upon him while he is eating. 
\q1
\v 24 He shall flee from the iron weapon, 
\q1 \add And\add* the bow of steel shall strike him through. 
\q1
\v 25 It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; 
\q1 Yea, the glistering sword cometh out of his gall: 
\q1 Terrors \add are\add* upon him. 
\b
\q1
\v 26 All darkness \add shall be\add* hid in his secret places: 
\q1 A fire not blown shall consume him; 
\q1 It shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle. 
\q1
\v 27 The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; 
\q1 And the earth shall rise up against him. 
\q1
\v 28 The increase of his house shall depart, 
\q1 \add And his goods shall\add* flow away in the day of his wrath. 
\q1
\v 29 This \add is\add* the portion of a wicked man from God, 
\q1 And the heritage appointed unto him by God. 
\c 21  
\p
\v 1 But Job answered and said, 
\q1
\v 2 Hear diligently my speech, 
\q1 And let this be your consolations. 
\q1
\v 3 Suffer me that I may speak; 
\q1 And after that I have spoken, mock on. 
\q1
\v 4  \add As for\add* me, \add is\add* my complaint to man? 
\q1 And if \add it were so\add*, why should not my spirit be troubled? 
\q1
\v 5 Mark me, and be astonished, 
\q1 And lay \add your\add* hand upon \add your\add* mouth. 
\q1
\v 6 Even when I remember I am afraid, 
\q1 And trembling taketh hold on my flesh. 
\b
\q1
\v 7 Wherefore do the wicked live, 
\q1 Become old, yea, are mighty \add in\add* power? 
\q1
\v 8 Their seed is established in their sight with them, 
\q1 And their offspring before their eyes. 
\q1
\v 9 Their houses \add are\add* safe from fear, 
\q1 Neither \add is\add* the rod of God upon them. 
\q1
\v 10 Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; 
\q1 Their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf. 
\q1
\v 11 They send forth their little ones like a flock, 
\q1 And their children dance. 
\b
\q1
\v 12 They take the timbrel and harp, 
\q1 And rejoice at the sound of the organ. 
\q1
\v 13 They spend their days in wealth, 
\q1 And in a moment go down \add to\add* the grave. 
\q1
\v 14 Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; 
\q1 For we desire not the knowledge of thy ways. 
\q1
\v 15 What \add is\add* the Almighty, that we should serve him? 
\q1 And what profit should we have, if we pray unto him? 
\q1
\v 16 Lo, their good \add is\add* not in their hand: 
\q1 The counsel of the wicked is far from me. 
\q1
\v 17 How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! 
\q1 And \add how oft\add* cometh their destruction upon them! 
\q1 \add God\add* distributeth sorrows in his anger. 
\q1
\v 18 They are as stubble before the wind, 
\q1 And as chaff that the storm carrieth away. 
\q1
\v 19 God layeth up his iniquity for his children: 
\q1 He rewardeth him, and he shall know \add it\add*. 
\q1
\v 20 His eyes shall see his destruction, 
\q1 And he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty. 
\q1
\v 21 For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, 
\q1 When the number of his months is cut off in the midst? 
\b
\q1
\v 22 Shall \add any\add* teach God knowledge? 
\q1 Seeing he judgeth those that are high. 
\q1
\v 23 One dieth in his full strength, 
\q1 \add Being\add* wholly at ease and quiet. 
\q1
\v 24 His breasts are full \add of\add* milk, 
\q1 And his bones are moistened with marrow. 
\q1
\v 25 And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, 
\q1 And never eateth with pleasure. 
\q1
\v 26 They shall lie down alike in the dust, 
\q1 And the worms shall cover them. 
\b
\q1
\v 27 Behold, I know your thoughts, 
\q1 And the devices \add which\add* ye wrongfully imagine against me. 
\q1
\v 28 For ye say, Where \add is\add* the house of the prince? 
\q1 And where \add are\add* the dwelling places of the wicked? 
\q1
\v 29 Have ye not asked them that go by the way? 
\q1 And do ye not know their tokens, 
\q1
\v 30 That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? 
\q1 They shall be brought forth to the day of wrath. 
\q1
\v 31 Who shall declare his way to his face? 
\q1 And who shall repay him \add what\add* he hath done? 
\b
\q1
\v 32 Yet shall he be brought to the grave, 
\q1 And shall remain in the tomb. 
\q1
\v 33 The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, 
\q1 And every man shall draw after him, 
\q1 As \add there are\add* innumerable before him. 
\b
\q1
\v 34 How then comfort ye me in vain, 
\q1 Seeing \add in\add* your answers there remaineth falsehood? 
\c 22  
\p
\v 1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, 
\q1
\v 2 Can a man be profitable unto God, 
\q1 As he that is wise may be profitable unto himself? 
\q1
\v 3  \add Is it any\add* pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? 
\q1 Or \add is it\add* gain \add to him\add*, that thou makest thy ways perfect? 
\q1
\v 4 Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? 
\q1 Will he enter with thee into judgment? 
\b
\q1
\v 5  \add Is\add* not thy wickedness great? 
\q1 And thine iniquities infinite? 
\q1
\v 6 For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, 
\q1 And stripped the naked of their clothing. 
\q1
\v 7 Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, 
\q1 And thou hast withholden bread from the hungry. 
\q1
\v 8 But \add as for\add* the mighty man, he had the earth; 
\q1 And the honourable \add man\add* dwelt in it. 
\q1
\v 9 Thou hast sent widows away empty, 
\q1 And the arms of the fatherless have been broken. 
\b
\q1
\v 10 Therefore snares \add are\add* round about thee, 
\q1 And sudden fear troubleth thee; 
\q1
\v 11 Or darkness, \add that\add* thou canst not see; 
\q1 And abundance of waters cover thee. 
\b
\q1
\v 12  \add Is\add* not God \add in\add* the height of heaven? 
\q1 And behold the height of the stars, how high they are. 
\q1
\v 13 And thou sayest, How doth God know? 
\q1 Can he judge through the dark \add cloud?\add* 
\q1
\v 14 Thick clouds \add are\add* a covering to him, that he seeth not; 
\q1 And he walketh \add in\add* the circuit of heaven. 
\b
\q1
\v 15 Hast thou marked the old way 
\q1 Which wicked men have trodden? 
\q1
\v 16 Which were cut down out of time, 
\q1 Whose foundation was overflown \add with\add* a flood: 
\q1
\v 17 Which said unto God, Depart from us: 
\q1 And what can the Almighty do for them? 
\q1
\v 18 Yet he filled their houses \add with\add* good \add things:\add* 
\q1 But the counsel of the wicked is far from me. 
\b
\q1
\v 19 The righteous see \add it\add*, and are glad: 
\q1 And the innocent laugh them to scorn. 
\q1
\v 20 Whereas our substance is not cut down, 
\q1 But the remnant of them the fire consumeth. 
\b
\q1
\v 21 Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: 
\q1 Thereby good shall come \add unto\add* thee. 
\q1
\v 22 Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, 
\q1 And lay up his words in thine heart. 
\q1
\v 23 If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built \add up\add*, 
\q1 Thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles. 
\q1
\v 24 Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, 
\q1 And \add the gold of\add* Ophir as the stones of the brooks. 
\q1
\v 25 Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, 
\q1 And thou shalt have plenty of silver. 
\b
\q1
\v 26 For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, 
\q1 And shalt lift up thy face unto God. 
\q1
\v 27 Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, 
\q1 And thou shalt pay thy vows. 
\q1
\v 28 Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: 
\q1 And the light shall shine upon thy ways. 
\q1
\v 29 When \add men\add* are cast down, then thou shalt say, \add There is\add* lifting up; 
\q1 And he shall save the humble person. 
\q1
\v 30 He shall deliver the island of the innocent: 
\q1 And it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands. 
\c 23  
\p
\v 1 Then Job answered and said, 
\q1
\v 2 Even to day \add is\add* my complaint bitter: 
\q1 My stroke is heavier than my groaning. 
\q1
\v 3 O that I knew where I might find him! 
\q1 \add That\add* I might come \add even\add* to his seat! 
\q1
\v 4 I would order \add my\add* cause before him, 
\q1 And fill my mouth \add with\add* arguments. 
\q1
\v 5 I would know the words \add which\add* he would answer me, 
\q1 And understand what he would say unto me. 
\b
\q1
\v 6 Will he plead against me with \add his\add* great power? 
\q1 No; but he would put \add strength\add* in me. 
\q1
\v 7 There the righteous \add might\add* dispute with him; 
\q1 So should I be delivered for ever from my judge. 
\q1
\v 8 Behold, I go forward, but he \add is\add* not \add there;\add* 
\q1 And backward, but I cannot perceive him: 
\q1
\v 9  \add On\add* the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold \add him:\add* 
\q1 He hideth \add himself on\add* the right hand, that I cannot see \add him:\add* 
\b
\q1
\v 10 But he knoweth the way that I take: 
\q1 \add When\add* he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold. 
\q1
\v 11 My foot hath held his steps, 
\q1 His way have I kept, and not declined. 
\q1
\v 12 Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; 
\q1 I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary \add food\add*. 
\q1
\v 13 But he \add is\add* in one \add mind\add*, and who can turn him? 
\q1 And \add what\add* his soul desireth, even \add that\add* he doeth. 
\b
\q1
\v 14 For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: 
\q1 And many such \add things are\add* with him. 
\q1
\v 15 Therefore am I troubled at his presence: 
\q1 When I consider, I am afraid of him. 
\q1
\v 16 For God maketh my heart soft, 
\q1 And the Almighty troubleth me: 
\q1
\v 17 Because I was not cut off before the darkness, 
\q1 \add Neither\add* hath he covered the darkness from my face. 
\b
\c  24  
\q1
\v 1 Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, 
\q1 Do they that know him not see his days? 
\q1
\v 2  \add Some\add* remove the landmarks; 
\q1 They violently take away flocks, and feed \add thereof\add*. 
\q1
\v 3 They drive away the ass of the fatherless, 
\q1 They take the widow’s ox for a pledge. 
\q1
\v 4 They turn the needy out of the way: 
\q1 The poor of the earth hide themselves together. 
\b
\q1
\v 5 Behold, \add as\add* wild asses in the desert, 
\q1 Go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: 
\q1 The wilderness \add yieldeth\add* food for them \add and\add* for \add their\add* children. 
\q1
\v 6 They reap \add every one\add* his corn in the field: 
\q1 And they gather the vintage of the wicked. 
\q1
\v 7 They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, 
\q1 That \add they have\add* no covering in the cold. 
\q1
\v 8 They are wet with the showers of the mountains, 
\q1 And embrace the rock for want of a shelter. 
\b
\q1
\v 9 They pluck the fatherless from the breast, 
\q1 And take a pledge of the poor. 
\q1
\v 10 They cause \add him\add* to go naked without clothing, 
\q1 And they take away the sheaf \add from\add* the hungry; 
\q1
\v 11  \add Which\add* make oil within their walls, 
\q1 \add And\add* tread \add their\add* winepresses, and suffer thirst. 
\q1
\v 12 Men groan from out of the city, 
\q1 And the soul of the wounded crieth out: 
\q1 Yet God layeth not folly \add to them\add*. 
\b
\q1
\v 13 They are of those that rebel against the light; 
\q1 They know not the ways thereof, 
\q1 Nor abide in the paths thereof. 
\q1
\v 14 The murderer rising with the light 
\q1 Killeth the poor and needy, 
\q1 And in the night is as a thief. 
\q1
\v 15 The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, 
\q1 Saying, No eye shall see me: 
\q1 And disguiseth \add his\add* face. 
\q1
\v 16 In the dark \add they\add* dig \add through\add* houses, 
\q1 \add Which\add* they had marked for themselves in the daytime: 
\q1 They know not the light. 
\q1
\v 17 For the morning \add is\add* to them even as the shadow of death: 
\q1 If \add one\add* know \add them, they are in\add* the terrors of the shadow of death. 
\b
\q1
\v 18 He \add is\add* swift as the waters; 
\q1 Their portion is cursed in the earth: 
\q1 He beholdeth not the way of the vineyards. 
\q1
\v 19 Drought and heat consume the snow waters: 
\q1 \add So doth\add* the grave \add those which\add* have sinned. 
\q1
\v 20 The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; 
\q1 He shall be no more remembered; 
\q1 And wickedness shall be broken as a tree. 
\q1
\v 21 He evil entreateth the barren \add that\add* beareth not: 
\q1 And doeth not good to the widow. 
\b
\q1
\v 22 He draweth also the mighty with his power: 
\q1 He riseth up, and no \add man\add* is sure of life. 
\q1
\v 23  \add Though\add* it be given him \add to be\add* in safety, whereon he resteth; 
\q1 Yet his eyes \add are\add* upon their ways. 
\q1
\v 24 They are exalted for a little while, but are gone 
\q1 And brought low, they are taken out of the way as all \add other\add*, 
\q1 And cut off as the tops of the ears of corn. 
\q1
\v 25 And if \add it be\add* not \add so\add* now, who will make me a liar, 
\q1 And make my speech nothing worth? 
\c 25  
\p
\v 1 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 
\q1
\v 2 Dominion and fear \add are\add* with him, 
\q1 He maketh peace in his high places. 
\q1
\v 3 Is there \add any\add* number of his armies? 
\q1 And upon whom doth not his light arise? 
\q1
\v 4 How then can man be justified with God? 
\q1 Or how can he be clean \add that is\add* born of a woman? 
\q1
\v 5 Behold \add even\add* to the moon, and it shineth not; 
\q1 Yea, the stars are not pure in his sight. 
\q1
\v 6 How much less man, \add that is\add* a worm? 
\q1 And the son of man, \add which is\add* a worm? 
\c 26  
\p
\v 1 But Job answered and said, 
\q1
\v 2 How hast thou helped \add him that is\add* without power? 
\q1 \add How\add* savest thou the arm \add that hath\add* no strength? 
\q1
\v 3 How hast thou counselled \add him that hath\add* no wisdom? 
\q1 And \add how\add* hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is? 
\q1
\v 4 To whom hast thou uttered words? 
\q1 And whose spirit came from thee? 
\b
\q1
\v 5 Dead \add things\add* are formed 
\q1 From under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof. 
\q1
\v 6 Hell \add is\add* naked before him, 
\q1 And destruction hath no covering. 
\q1
\v 7 He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, 
\q1 \add And\add* hangeth the earth upon nothing. 
\b
\q1
\v 8 He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; 
\q1 And the cloud is not rent under them. 
\q1
\v 9 He holdeth back the face of \add his\add* throne, 
\q1 \add And\add* spreadeth his cloud upon it. 
\q1
\v 10 He hath compassed the waters with bounds, 
\q1 Until the day and night come to an end. 
\b
\q1
\v 11 The pillars of heaven tremble 
\q1 And are astonished at his reproof. 
\q1
\v 12 He divideth the sea with his power, 
\q1 And by his understanding he smiteth through the proud. 
\q1
\v 13 By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; 
\q1 His hand hath formed the crooked serpent. 
\b
\q1
\v 14 Lo, these \add are\add* parts of his ways: 
\q1 But how little a portion is heard of him? 
\q1 But the thunder of his power who can understand? 
\c 27  
\p
\v 1 Moreover Job continued his parable, and said, 
\q1
\v 2  \add As\add* God liveth, \add who\add* hath taken away my judgment; 
\q1 And the Almighty, \add who\add* hath vexed my soul; 
\q1
\v 3 All the while my breath \add is\add* in me, 
\q1 And the spirit of God \add is\add* in my nostrils; 
\q1
\v 4 My lips shall not speak wickedness, 
\q1 Nor my tongue utter deceit. 
\q1
\v 5 God forbid that I should justify you: 
\q1 Till I die I will not remove my integrity from me. 
\q1
\v 6 My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: 
\q1 My heart shall not reproach \add me\add* so long as I live. 
\q1
\v 7 Let mine enemy be as the wicked, 
\q1 And he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous. 
\b
\q1
\v 8 For what \add is\add* the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, 
\q1 When God taketh away his soul? 
\q1
\v 9 Will God hear his cry 
\q1 When trouble cometh upon him? 
\q1
\v 10 Will he delight himself in the Almighty? 
\q1 Will he always call upon God? 
\q1
\v 11 I will teach you by the hand of God: 
\q1 \add That\add* which \add is\add* with the Almighty will I not conceal. 
\q1
\v 12 Behold, all ye yourselves have seen \add it;\add* 
\q1 Why then are ye thus altogether vain? 
\b
\q1
\v 13 This \add is\add* the portion of a wicked man with God, 
\q1 And the heritage of oppressors, \add which\add* they shall receive of the Almighty. 
\q1
\v 14 If his children be multiplied, \add it is\add* for the sword: 
\q1 And his offspring shall not be satisfied \add with\add* bread. 
\q1
\v 15 Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: 
\q1 And his widows shall not weep. 
\q1
\v 16 Though he heap up silver as the dust, 
\q1 And prepare raiment as the clay; 
\q1
\v 17 He may prepare \add it\add*, but the just shall put \add it\add* on, 
\q1 And the innocent shall divide the silver. 
\q1
\v 18 He buildeth his house as a moth, 
\q1 And as a booth \add that\add* the keeper maketh. 
\b
\q1
\v 19 The rich \add man\add* shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: 
\q1 He openeth his eyes, and he \add is\add* not. 
\q1
\v 20 Terrors take hold on him as waters, 
\q1 A tempest stealeth him away in the night. 
\q1
\v 21 The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: 
\q1 And as a storm hurleth him out of his place. 
\q1
\v 22 For \add God\add* shall cast upon him, and not spare: 
\q1 He would fain flee out of his hand. 
\q1
\v 23  \add Men\add* shall clap their hands at him, 
\q1 And shall hiss him out of his place. 
\b
\c  28  
\q1
\v 1 Surely there is a vein for the silver, 
\q1 And a place for gold \add where\add* they fine \add it\add*. 
\q1
\v 2 Iron is taken out of the earth, 
\q1 And brass \add is\add* molten \add out of\add* the stone. 
\q1
\v 3 He setteth an end to darkness, 
\q1 And searcheth out all perfection, 
\q1 The stones of darkness, and the shadow of death. 
\q1
\v 4 The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; 
\q1 \add Even the waters\add* forgotten of the foot: 
\q1 They are dried up, they are gone away from men. 
\b
\q1
\v 5  \add As for\add* the earth, out of it cometh bread: 
\q1 And under it is turned up as it were fire. 
\q1
\v 6 The stones of it \add are\add* the place of sapphires: 
\q1 And it hath dust of gold. 
\q1
\v 7  \add There is\add* a path which no fowl knoweth, 
\q1 And which the vulture’s eye hath not seen: 
\q1
\v 8 The lion’s whelps have not trodden it, 
\q1 Nor the fierce lion passed by it. 
\b
\q1
\v 9 He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; 
\q1 He overturneth the mountains by the roots. 
\q1
\v 10 He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; 
\q1 And his eye seeth every precious thing. 
\q1
\v 11 He bindeth the floods from overflowing; 
\q1 And the thing that is hid bringeth he forth \add to\add* light. 
\q1
\v 12 But where shall wisdom be found? 
\q1 And where \add is\add* the place of understanding? 
\b
\q1
\v 13 Man knoweth not the price thereof; 
\q1 Neither is it found in the land of the living. 
\q1
\v 14 The depth saith, It \add is\add* not in me: 
\q1 And the sea saith, \add It is\add* not with me. 
\q1
\v 15 It cannot be gotten for gold, 
\q1 Neither shall silver be weighed \add for\add* the price thereof. 
\q1
\v 16 It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, 
\q1 With the precious onyx, or the sapphire. 
\b
\q1
\v 17 The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: 
\q1 And the exchange of it \add shall not be for\add* jewels of fine gold. 
\q1
\v 18 No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: 
\q1 For the price of wisdom \add is\add* above rubies. 
\q1
\v 19 The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, 
\q1 Neither shall it be valued with pure gold. 
\b
\q1
\v 20 Whence then cometh wisdom? 
\q1 And where \add is\add* the place of understanding? 
\q1
\v 21 Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, 
\q1 And kept close from the fowls of the air. 
\q1
\v 22 Destruction and death say, 
\q1 We have heard the fame thereof with our ears. 
\q1
\v 23 God understandeth the way thereof, 
\q1 And he knoweth the place thereof. 
\q1
\v 24 For he looketh to the ends of the earth, 
\q1 \add And\add* seeth under the whole heaven; 
\b
\q1
\v 25 To make the weight for the winds; 
\q1 And he weigheth the waters by measure. 
\q1
\v 26 When he made a decree for the rain, 
\q1 And a way for the lightning of the thunder: 
\q1
\v 27 Then did he see it, and declare it; 
\q1 He prepared it, yea, and searched it out. 
\q1
\v 28 And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that \add is\add* wisdom; 
\q1 And to depart from evil \add is\add* understanding. 
\c 29  
\p
\v 1 Moreover Job continued his parable, and said, 
\q1
\v 2 O that I were as \add in\add* months past, 
\q1 As \add in\add* the days \add when\add* God preserved me; 
\q1
\v 3 When his candle shined upon my head, 
\q1 \add And when\add* by his light I walked \add through\add* darkness; 
\q1
\v 4 As I was in the days of my youth, 
\q1 When the secret of God \add was\add* upon my tabernacle; 
\q1
\v 5 When the Almighty \add was\add* yet with me, 
\q1 \add When\add* my children \add were\add* about me; 
\q1
\v 6 When \add I\add* washed my steps with butter, 
\q1 And the rock poured me out rivers of oil; 
\b
\q1
\v 7 When I went out \add to\add* the gate through the city, 
\q1 \add When\add* I prepared my seat in the street; 
\q1
\v 8 The young men saw me, and hid themselves: 
\q1 And the aged arose, \add and\add* stood \add up\add*. 
\q1
\v 9 The princes refrained talking, 
\q1 And laid \add their\add* hand on their mouth. 
\q1
\v 10 The nobles held their peace, 
\q1 And their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth. 
\b
\q1
\v 11 When the ear heard \add me\add*, then it blessed me; 
\q1 And when the eye saw \add me\add*, it gave witness to me: 
\q1
\v 12 Because I delivered the poor that cried, 
\q1 And the fatherless, and \add him that had\add* none to help him. 
\q1
\v 13 The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: 
\q1 And I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy. 
\q1
\v 14 I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: 
\q1 My judgment \add was\add* as a robe and a diadem. 
\b
\q1
\v 15 I was eyes to the blind, 
\q1 And feet \add was\add* I to the lame. 
\q1
\v 16 I \add was\add* a father to the poor: 
\q1 And the cause \add which\add* I knew not I searched out. 
\q1
\v 17 And I brake the jaws of the wicked, 
\q1 And pluckt the spoil out of his teeth. 
\b
\q1
\v 18 Then I said, I shall die in my nest, 
\q1 And I shall multiply \add my\add* days as the sand. 
\q1
\v 19 My root \add was\add* spread out by the waters, 
\q1 And the dew lay all night upon my branch. 
\q1
\v 20 My glory \add was\add* fresh in me, 
\q1 And my bow was renewed in my hand. 
\b
\q1
\v 21 Unto me \add men\add* gave ear, and waited, 
\q1 And kept silence at my counsel. 
\q1
\v 22 After my words they spake not again; 
\q1 And my speech dropped upon them. 
\q1
\v 23 And they waited for me as for the rain; 
\q1 And they opened their mouth wide \add as\add* for the latter rain. 
\q1
\v 24  \add If\add* I laughed on them, they believed \add it\add* not; 
\q1 And the light of my countenance they cast not down. 
\q1
\v 25 I chose out their way, and sat chief, 
\q1 And dwelt as a king in the army, 
\q1 As \add one that\add* comforteth the mourners. 
\b
\c  30  
\q1
\v 1 But now \add they that are\add* younger than I have me in derision, 
\q1 Whose fathers I would have disdained 
\q1 To have set with the dogs of my flock. 
\q1
\v 2 Yea, whereto \add might\add* the strength of their hands profit me, 
\q1 In whom old age was perished? 
\q1
\v 3 For want and famine \add they were\add* solitary; 
\q1 Flying \add into\add* the wilderness 
\q1 In former time desolate and waste. 
\q1
\v 4 Who cut up mallows by the bushes, 
\q1 And juniper roots \add for\add* their meat. 
\q1
\v 5 They were driven forth from among men, 
\q1 (They cried after them as \add after\add* a thief;) 
\q1
\v 6 To dwell in the clifts of the valleys, 
\q1 \add In\add* caves of the earth, and \add in\add* the rocks. 
\q1
\v 7 Among the bushes they brayed; 
\q1 Under the nettles they were gathered together. 
\q1
\v 8  \add They were\add* children of fools, yea, children of base men: 
\q1 They were viler than the earth. 
\b
\q1
\v 9 And now am I their song, 
\q1 Yea, I am their byword. 
\q1
\v 10 They abhor me, they flee far from me, 
\q1 And spare not to spit in my face. 
\q1
\v 11 Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, 
\q1 They have also let loose the bridle before me. 
\q1
\v 12 Upon \add my\add* right hand rise the youth; 
\q1 They push away my feet, 
\q1 And they raise up against me the ways of their destruction. 
\q1
\v 13 They mar my path, 
\q1 They set forward my calamity, 
\q1 They have no helper. 
\q1
\v 14 They came \add upon me\add* as a wide breaking in \add of waters:\add* 
\q1 In the desolation they rolled themselves \add upon me\add*. 
\q1
\v 15 Terrors are turned upon me: 
\q1 They pursue my soul as the wind: 
\q1 And my welfare passeth away as a cloud. 
\b
\q1
\v 16 And now my soul is poured out upon me; 
\q1 The days of affliction have taken hold upon me. 
\q1
\v 17 My bones are pierced in me in the night season: 
\q1 And my sinews take no rest. 
\q1
\v 18 By the great force \add of my disease\add* is my garment changed: 
\q1 It bindeth me about as the collar of my coat. 
\q1
\v 19 He hath cast me into the mire, 
\q1 And I am become like dust and ashes. 
\b
\q1
\v 20 I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: 
\q1 I stand \add up\add*, and thou regardest me \add not\add*. 
\q1
\v 21 Thou art become cruel to me: 
\q1 With thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me. 
\q1
\v 22 Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride \add upon it\add*, 
\q1 And dissolvest my substance. 
\q1
\v 23 For I know \add that\add* thou wilt bring me \add to\add* death, 
\q1 And \add to\add* the house appointed for all living. 
\b
\q1
\v 24 Howbeit \add he\add* will not stretch out \add his\add* hand to the grave, 
\q1 Though \add they\add* cry in his destruction. 
\q1
\v 25 Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? 
\q1 Was \add not\add* my soul grieved for the poor? 
\q1
\v 26 When I looked for good, then evil came \add unto me:\add* 
\q1 And when I waited for light, there came darkness. 
\q1
\v 27 My bowels boiled, and rested not: 
\q1 The days of affliction prevented me. 
\b
\q1
\v 28 I went mourning without the sun: 
\q1 I stood up, \add and\add* I cried in the congregation. 
\q1
\v 29 I am a brother to dragons, 
\q1 And a companion to owls. 
\q1
\v 30 My skin is black upon me, 
\q1 And my bones are burnt with heat. 
\q1
\v 31 My harp also is \add turned\add* to mourning, 
\q1 And my organ into the voice of them that weep. 
\b
\c  31  
\q1
\v 1 I made a covenant with mine eyes; 
\q1 Why then should I think upon a maid? 
\q1
\v 2 For what portion of God \add is there\add* from above? 
\q1 And \add what\add* inheritance of the Almighty from on high? 
\q1
\v 3  \add Is\add* not destruction to the wicked? 
\q1 And a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity? 
\q1
\v 4 Doth not he see my ways, 
\q1 And count all my steps? 
\b
\q1
\v 5 If I have walked with vanity, 
\q1 Or \add if\add* my foot hath hasted to deceit; 
\q1
\v 6 Let me be weighed in an even balance, 
\q1 That God may know mine integrity. 
\q1
\v 7 If my step hath turned out of the way, 
\q1 And mine heart walked after mine eyes, 
\q1 And \add if any\add* blot hath cleaved to my hands; 
\q1
\v 8  \add Then\add* let me sow, and let another eat; 
\q1 Yea, let my offspring be rooted out. 
\b
\q1
\v 9 If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, 
\q1 Or \add if\add* I have laid wait at my neighbour’s door; 
\q1
\v 10  \add Then\add* let my wife grind unto another, 
\q1 And let others bow down upon her. 
\q1
\v 11 For this \add is\add* a heinous crime; 
\q1 Yea, it \add is\add* an iniquity \add to be punished by\add* the judges. 
\q1
\v 12 For it \add is\add* a fire \add that\add* consumeth to destruction, 
\q1 And would root out all mine increase. 
\b
\q1
\v 13 If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, 
\q1 When they contended with me; 
\q1
\v 14 What then shall I do when God riseth up? 
\q1 And when he visiteth, what shall I answer him? 
\q1
\v 15 Did not he that made me in the womb make him? 
\q1 And did not one fashion us in the womb? 
\b
\q1
\v 16 If I have withheld the poor from \add their\add* desire, 
\q1 Or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail; 
\q1
\v 17 Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, 
\q1 And the fatherless hath not eaten thereof; 
\q1
\v 18 (For from my youth he was brought up \add with\add* me, as \add with\add* a father, 
\q1 And I have guided her from my mother’s womb;) 
\q1
\v 19 If I have seen \add any\add* perish for want of clothing, 
\q1 Or \add any\add* poor without covering; 
\q1
\v 20 If his loins have not blessed me, 
\q1 And \add if\add* he were \add not\add* warmed with the fleece of my sheep; 
\q1
\v 21 If I have lift up my hand against the fatherless, 
\q1 When I saw my help in the gate: 
\q1
\v 22  \add Then\add* let mine arm fall from \add my\add* shoulder blade, 
\q1 And mine arm be broken from the bone. 
\q1
\v 23 For destruction from God \add was\add* a terror to me, 
\q1 And by reason of his highness I could not endure. 
\b
\q1
\v 24 If I have made gold my hope, 
\q1 Or have said to the fine gold, \add Thou art\add* my confidence; 
\q1
\v 25 If I rejoiced because my wealth \add was\add* great, 
\q1 And because mine hand had gotten much; 
\q1
\v 26 If I beheld the sun when it shined, 
\q1 Or the moon walking \add in\add* brightness; 
\q1
\v 27 And my heart hath been secretly enticed, 
\q1 Or my mouth hath kissed my hand: 
\q1
\v 28 This also \add were\add* an iniquity \add to be punished by\add* the judge: 
\q1 For I should have denied the God \add that is\add* above. 
\b
\q1
\v 29 If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, 
\q1 Or lift up myself when evil found him: 
\q1
\v 30 (Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin 
\q1 By wishing a curse to his soul.) 
\b
\q1
\v 31 If the men of my tabernacle said not, 
\q1 O that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied. 
\q1
\v 32 The stranger did not lodge in the street: 
\q1 \add But\add* I opened my doors to the traveller. 
\q1
\v 33 If I covered my transgressions as Adam, 
\q1 By hiding mine iniquity in my bosom: 
\q1
\v 34 Did I fear a great multitude, 
\q1 Or did the contempt of families terrify me, 
\q1 That I kept silence, \add and\add* went not out \add of\add* the door? 
\b
\q1
\v 35 O that one would hear me! 
\q1 Behold, my desire \add is, that\add* the Almighty would answer me, 
\q1 And \add that\add* mine adversary had written a book. 
\q1
\v 36 Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, 
\q1 \add And\add* bind it \add as\add* a crown to me. 
\q1
\v 37 I would declare unto him the number of my steps; 
\q1 As a prince would I go near unto him. 
\b
\q1
\v 38 If my land cry against me, 
\q1 Or that the furrows likewise thereof complain; 
\q1
\v 39 If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, 
\q1 Or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life: 
\q1
\v 40 Let thistles grow instead of wheat, 
\q1 And cockle instead of barley. 
\b
\q1 The words of Job are ended. 
\c 32  
\p
\v 1 So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he \add was\add* righteous in his own eyes. 
\v 2 Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God. 
\v 3 Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and \add yet\add* had condemned Job. 
\v 4 Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they \add were\add* elder than he. 
\v 5 When Elihu saw that \add there was\add* no answer in the mouth of \add these\add* three men, then his wrath was kindled. 
\p
\v 6 And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, 
\q1 I \add am\add* young, and ye \add are\add* very old; 
\q1 Wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion. 
\q1
\v 7 I said, Days should speak, 
\q1 And multitude of years should teach wisdom. 
\q1
\v 8 But \add there is\add* a spirit in man: 
\q1 And the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding. 
\q1
\v 9 Great men are not \add always\add* wise: 
\q1 Neither do the aged understand judgment. 
\q1
\v 10 Therefore I said, Hearken to me; 
\q1 I also will shew mine opinion. 
\b
\q1
\v 11 Behold, I waited for your words; 
\q1 I gave ear to your reasons, 
\q1 Whilst you searched out what to say. 
\q1
\v 12 Yea, I attended unto you, 
\q1 And behold, \add there was\add* none of you that convinced Job, 
\q1 \add Or\add* that answered his words: 
\q1
\v 13 Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: 
\q1 God thrusteth him down, not man. 
\q1
\v 14 Now he hath not directed \add his\add* words against me: 
\q1 Neither will I answer him with your speeches. 
\b
\q1
\v 15 They were amazed, they answered no more: 
\q1 They left off speaking. 
\q1
\v 16 When I had waited, (for they spake not, 
\q1 But stood still, \add and\add* answered no more:) 
\q1
\v 17  \add I said\add*, I will answer also my part, 
\q1 I also will shew mine opinion. 
\b
\q1
\v 18 For I am full \add of\add* matter, 
\q1 The spirit within me constraineth me. 
\q1
\v 19 Behold, my belly \add is\add* as wine \add which\add* hath no vent; 
\q1 It is ready to burst like new bottles. 
\q1
\v 20 I will speak, that I may be refreshed: 
\q1 I will open my lips and answer. 
\q1
\v 21 Let me not, I pray you, accept \add any\add* man’s person, 
\q1 Neither let me give flattering titles unto man. 
\q1
\v 22 For I know not to give flattering titles; 
\q1 \add In so doing\add* my Maker would soon take me away. 
\b
\c  33  
\q1
\v 1 Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, 
\q1 And hearken to all my words. 
\q1
\v 2 Behold, now I have opened my mouth, 
\q1 My tongue hath spoken in my mouth. 
\q1
\v 3 My words \add shall be of\add* the uprightness of my heart: 
\q1 And my lips shall utter knowledge clearly. 
\q1
\v 4 The Spirit of God hath made me, 
\q1 And the breath of the Almighty hath given me life. 
\q1
\v 5 If thou canst, answer me, 
\q1 Set \add thy words\add* in order before me, stand up. 
\q1
\v 6 Behold, I \add am\add* according to thy wish in God’s stead: 
\q1 I also am formed out of the clay. 
\q1
\v 7 Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, 
\q1 Neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee. 
\b
\q1
\v 8 Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, 
\q1 And I have heard the voice of \add thy\add* words, \add saying\add*, 
\q1
\v 9 I am clean without transgression, 
\q1 I \add am\add* innocent; neither \add is there\add* iniquity in me. 
\q1
\v 10 Behold, he findeth occasions against me, 
\q1 He counteth me for his enemy, 
\q1
\v 11 He putteth my feet in the stocks, 
\q1 He marketh all my paths. 
\q1
\v 12 Behold, \add in\add* this thou art not just: I will answer thee, 
\q1 That God is greater than man. 
\b
\q1
\v 13 Why dost thou strive against him? 
\q1 For he giveth not account of any of his matters. 
\q1
\v 14 For God speaketh once, 
\q1 Yea twice, \add yet man\add* perceiveth it not. 
\q1
\v 15 In a dream, \add in\add* a vision of the night, 
\q1 When deep sleep falleth upon men, 
\q1 In slumberings upon the bed; 
\q1
\v 16 Then he openeth the ears of men, 
\q1 And sealeth their instruction, 
\q1
\v 17 That \add he\add* may withdraw man \add from his\add* purpose, 
\q1 And hide pride from man. 
\q1
\v 18 He keepeth back his soul from the pit, 
\q1 And his life from perishing by the sword. 
\b
\q1
\v 19 He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, 
\q1 And the multitude of his bones \add with\add* strong \add pain:\add* 
\q1
\v 20 So that his life abhorreth bread, 
\q1 And his soul dainty meat. 
\q1
\v 21 His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; 
\q1 And his bones \add that\add* were not seen stick out. 
\q1
\v 22 Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, 
\q1 And his life to the destroyers. 
\b
\q1
\v 23 If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, 
\q1 One among a thousand, 
\q1 To shew unto man his uprightness: 
\q1
\v 24 Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, 
\q1 Deliver him from going down \add to\add* the pit: 
\q1 I have found a ransom. 
\b
\q1
\v 25 His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s: 
\q1 He shall return to the days of his youth: 
\q1
\v 26 He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: 
\q1 And he shall see his face with joy: 
\q1 For he will render unto man his righteousness. 
\q1
\v 27 He looketh upon men, and \add if any\add* say, 
\q1 I have sinned, and perverted \add that which was\add* right, 
\q1 And it profited me not; 
\q1
\v 28 He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, 
\q1 And his life shall see the light. 
\b
\q1
\v 29 Lo, all these \add things\add* worketh God 
\q1 Oftentimes with man, 
\q1
\v 30 To bring back his soul from the pit, 
\q1 To be enlightened with the light of the living. 
\q1
\v 31 Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: 
\q1 Hold thy peace, and I will speak. 
\q1
\v 32 If \add thou\add* hast any thing to say, answer me: 
\q1 Speak, for I desire to justify thee. 
\q1
\v 33 If not, hearken unto me: 
\q1 Hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom. 
\c 34  
\p
\v 1 Furthermore Elihu answered and said, 
\q1
\v 2 Hear my words, O ye wise \add men;\add* 
\q1 And give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge. 
\q1
\v 3 For the ear trieth words, 
\q1 As the mouth tasteth meat. 
\q1
\v 4 Let us choose to us judgment: 
\q1 Let us know among ourselves what \add is\add* good. 
\b
\q1
\v 5 For Job hath said, I am righteous: 
\q1 And God hath taken away my judgment. 
\q1
\v 6 Should I lie against my right? 
\q1 My wound \add is\add* incurable without transgression. 
\q1
\v 7 What man \add is\add* like Job, 
\q1 \add Who\add* drinketh up scorning like water? 
\q1
\v 8 Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, 
\q1 And walketh with wicked men. 
\q1
\v 9 For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing 
\q1 That he should delight himself with God. 
\b
\q1
\v 10 Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: 
\q1 Far be it from God, \add that he should do\add* wickedness; 
\q1 And \add from\add* the Almighty, \add that he should commit\add* iniquity. 
\q1
\v 11 For the work of a man shall he render unto him, 
\q1 And cause every man to find according to \add his\add* ways. 
\b
\q1
\v 12 Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, 
\q1 Neither will the Almighty pervert judgment. 
\q1
\v 13 Who hath given him a charge over the earth? 
\q1 Or who hath disposed the whole world? 
\q1
\v 14 If he set his heart upon \add man\add*, 
\q1 \add If\add* he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath; 
\q1
\v 15 All flesh shall perish together, 
\q1 And man shall turn again unto dust. 
\b
\q1
\v 16 If now \add thou hast\add* understanding, hear this: 
\q1 Hearken to the voice of my words. 
\q1
\v 17 Shall even he that hateth right govern? 
\q1 And wilt thou condemn him that is most just? 
\q1
\v 18  \add Is it fit\add* to say to a king, \add Thou art\add* wicked? 
\q1 \add And\add* to princes, \add Ye are\add* ungodly? 
\q1
\v 19  \add How much less to him\add* that accepteth not the persons of princes, 
\q1 Nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? 
\q1 For they all \add are\add* the work of his hands. 
\q1
\v 20  \add In\add* a moment shall they die, 
\q1 And the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: 
\q1 And the mighty shall be taken away without hand. 
\q1
\v 21 For his eyes \add are\add* upon the ways of man, 
\q1 And he seeth all his goings. 
\q1
\v 22  \add There is\add* no darkness, nor shadow of death, 
\q1 Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves. 
\q1
\v 23 For he will not lay upon man more \add than right;\add* 
\q1 That \add he\add* should enter into judgment with God. 
\b
\q1
\v 24 He shall break in pieces mighty \add men\add* without number, 
\q1 And set others in their stead. 
\q1
\v 25 Therefore he knoweth their works, 
\q1 And he overturneth \add them\add* in the night, so that they are destroyed. 
\q1
\v 26 He striketh them as wicked \add men\add* 
\q1 In the open sight of others; 
\q1
\v 27 Because they turned back from him, 
\q1 And would not consider any of his ways: 
\q1
\v 28 So that \add they\add* cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, 
\q1 And he heareth the cry of the afflicted. 
\b
\q1
\v 29 When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? 
\q1 And when he hideth \add his\add* face, who then can behold him? 
\q1 Whether \add it be done\add* against a nation, 
\q1 Or against a man only: 
\q1
\v 30 That the hypocrite reign not, 
\q1 Lest the people be ensnared. 
\q1
\v 31 Surely it is \add meet to be\add* said unto God, 
\q1 I have borne \add chastisement\add*, I will not offend \add any more:\add* 
\q1
\v 32  \add That which\add* I see not teach thou me: 
\q1 If I have done iniquity, I will do no more. 
\b
\q1
\v 33  \add Should it be\add* according to thy mind? he will recompense it, 
\q1 Whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: 
\q1 Therefore speak what thou knowest. 
\q1
\v 34 Let men of understanding tell me, 
\q1 And let a wise man hearken unto me. 
\q1
\v 35 Job hath spoken without knowledge, 
\q1 And his words \add were\add* without wisdom. 
\q1
\v 36 My desire \add is that\add* Job may be tried unto the end 
\q1 Because of \add his\add* answers for wicked men. 
\q1
\v 37 For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, 
\q1 He clappeth \add his hands\add* amongst us, 
\q1 And multiplieth his words against God. 
\c 35  
\p
\v 1 Elihu spake moreover, and said, 
\q1
\v 2 Thinkest thou this to be right, 
\q1 \add That\add* thou saidst, My righteousness \add is\add* more than God’s? 
\q1
\v 3 For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? 
\q1 \add And\add*, What profit shall I have, \add if I be cleansed\add* from my sin? 
\q1
\v 4 I will answer thee, 
\q1 And thy companions with thee. 
\b
\q1
\v 5 Look unto the heavens, and see; 
\q1 And behold the clouds \add which\add* are higher than thou. 
\q1
\v 6 If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? 
\q1 Or \add if\add* thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him? 
\q1
\v 7 If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? 
\q1 Or what receiveth he of thine hand? 
\q1
\v 8 Thy wickedness \add may hurt\add* a man as thou \add art;\add* 
\q1 And thy righteousness \add may profit\add* the son of man. 
\b
\q1
\v 9 By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make \add the oppressed\add* to cry: 
\q1 They cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty. 
\q1
\v 10 But none saith, Where \add is\add* God my Maker, 
\q1 Who giveth songs in the night; 
\q1
\v 11 Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, 
\q1 And maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven? 
\q1
\v 12 There they cry, but none giveth answer, 
\q1 Because of the pride of evil men. 
\q1
\v 13 Surely God will not hear vanity, 
\q1 Neither will the Almighty regard it. 
\b
\q1
\v 14 Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, 
\q1 \add Yet\add* judgment \add is\add* before him; therefore trust thou in him. 
\q1
\v 15 But now, because \add it is\add* not \add so\add*, he hath visited \add in\add* his anger; 
\q1 Yet he knoweth \add it\add* not in great extremity: 
\q1
\v 16 Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; 
\q1 He multiplieth words without knowledge. 
\c 36  
\p
\v 1 Elihu also proceeded, and said, 
\q1
\v 2 Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee 
\q1 That \add I have\add* yet to speak on God’s behalf. 
\q1
\v 3 I will fetch my knowledge from afar, 
\q1 And will ascribe righteousness to my Maker. 
\q1
\v 4 For truly my words \add shall\add* not \add be\add* false: 
\q1 \add He that is\add* perfect in knowledge \add is\add* with thee. 
\b
\q1
\v 5 Behold, God \add is\add* mighty, and despiseth not \add any:\add* 
\q1 \add He is\add* mighty in strength \add and\add* wisdom. 
\q1
\v 6 He preserveth not the life of the wicked: 
\q1 But giveth right to the poor. 
\q1
\v 7 He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: 
\q1 But with kings \add are they\add* on the throne; 
\q1 Yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted. 
\b
\q1
\v 8 And if \add they be\add* bound in fetters, 
\q1 \add And\add* be holden in cords of affliction; 
\q1
\v 9 Then he sheweth them their work, 
\q1 And their transgressions that they have exceeded. 
\q1
\v 10 He openeth also their ear to discipline, 
\q1 And commandeth that they return from iniquity. 
\b
\q1
\v 11 If they obey and serve \add him\add*, 
\q1 They shall spend their days in prosperity, 
\q1 And their years in pleasures. 
\q1
\v 12 But if they obey not, 
\q1 They shall perish by the sword, 
\q1 And they shall die without knowledge. 
\b
\q1
\v 13 But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: 
\q1 They cry not when he bindeth them. 
\q1
\v 14 They die in youth, 
\q1 And their life \add is\add* among the unclean. 
\q1
\v 15 He delivereth the poor in his affliction, 
\q1 And openeth their ears in oppression. 
\b
\q1
\v 16 Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait 
\q1 \add Into\add* a broad place, where \add there is\add* no straitness; 
\q1 And that which should be set on thy table \add should be\add* full \add of\add* fatness. 
\q1
\v 17 But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: 
\q1 Judgment and justice take hold on \add thee\add*. 
\q1
\v 18 Because \add there is\add* wrath, \add beware\add* lest he take thee away with \add his\add* stroke: 
\q1 Then a great ransom cannot deliver thee. 
\b
\q1
\v 19 Will he esteem thy riches? \add no\add*, not gold, 
\q1 Nor all the forces of strength. 
\q1
\v 20 Desire not the night, 
\q1 When people are cut off in their place. 
\q1
\v 21 Take heed, regard not iniquity: 
\q1 For this hast thou chosen rather than affliction. 
\b
\q1
\v 22 Behold, God exalteth by his power: 
\q1 Who teacheth like him? 
\q1
\v 23 Who hath enjoined him his way? 
\q1 Or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity? 
\q1
\v 24 Remember that thou magnify his work, 
\q1 Which men behold. 
\q1
\v 25 Every man may see it; 
\q1 Man may behold \add it\add* afar off. 
\b
\q1
\v 26 Behold, God \add is\add* great, and we know \add him\add* not, 
\q1 Neither can the number of his years be searched out. 
\q1
\v 27 For he maketh small the drops of water: 
\q1 They pour down rain according to the vapour thereof: 
\q1
\v 28 Which the clouds do drop 
\q1 \add And\add* distil upon man abundantly. 
\q1
\v 29 Also can \add any\add* understand the spreadings of the clouds, 
\q1 \add Or\add* the noise of his tabernacle? 
\b
\q1
\v 30 Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, 
\q1 And covereth the bottom of the sea. 
\q1
\v 31 For by them judgeth he the people; 
\q1 He giveth meat in abundance. 
\q1
\v 32 With clouds he covereth the light; 
\q1 And commandeth it \add not to shine\add* by \add the cloud\add* that cometh betwixt. 
\q1
\v 33 The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, 
\q1 The cattle also concerning the vapour. 
\b
\c  37  
\q1
\v 1 At this also my heart trembleth, 
\q1 And is moved out of his place. 
\q1
\v 2 Hear attentively the noise of his voice, 
\q1 And the sound \add that\add* goeth out of his mouth. 
\q1
\v 3 He directeth it under the whole heaven, 
\q1 And his lightning unto the ends of the earth. 
\q1
\v 4 After it a voice roareth: 
\q1 He thundereth with the voice of his excellency; 
\q1 And he will not stay them when his voice is heard. 
\q1
\v 5 God thundereth marvellously with his voice; 
\q1 Great \add things\add* doeth he, which we cannot comprehend. 
\b
\q1
\v 6 For he saith to the snow, Be thou \add on\add* the earth; 
\q1 Likewise \add to\add* the small rain, 
\q1 And \add to\add* the great rain of his strength. 
\q1
\v 7 He sealeth up the hand of every man; 
\q1 That all men may know his work. 
\q1
\v 8 Then the beasts go into dens, 
\q1 And remain in their places. 
\q1
\v 9 Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: 
\q1 And cold out of the north. 
\q1
\v 10 By the breath of God frost is given: 
\q1 And the breadth of the waters is straitened. 
\b
\q1
\v 11 Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: 
\q1 He scattereth his bright cloud: 
\q1
\v 12 And it is turned round about by his counsels: 
\q1 That they may do whatsoever he commandeth them 
\q1 Upon the face of the world in the earth. 
\q1
\v 13 He causeth it to come, whether for correction, 
\q1 Or for his land, or for mercy. 
\b
\q1
\v 14 Hearken unto this, O Job: 
\q1 Stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God. 
\q1
\v 15 Dost thou know when God disposed them, 
\q1 And caused the light of his cloud to shine? 
\q1
\v 16 Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, 
\q1 The wondrous works of \add him which is\add* perfect in knowledge? 
\b
\q1
\v 17 How thy garments \add are\add* warm, 
\q1 When he quieteth the earth by the south \add wind?\add* 
\q1
\v 18 Hast thou with him spread out the sky, 
\q1 \add Which is\add* strong, \add and\add* as a molten looking glass? 
\q1
\v 19 Teach us what we shall say unto him; 
\q1 \add For\add* we cannot order \add our speech\add* by reason of darkness. 
\q1
\v 20 Shall it be told him that I speak? 
\q1 If a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up. 
\b
\q1
\v 21 And now \add men\add* see not the bright light 
\q1 Which \add is\add* in the clouds: 
\q1 But the wind passeth, and cleanseth them. 
\q1
\v 22 Fair weather cometh out of the north: 
\q1 With God \add is\add* terrible majesty. 
\q1
\v 23  \add Touching\add* the Almighty, we cannot find him out: \add he is\add* excellent in power, 
\q1 And \add in\add* judgment, and \add in\add* plenty of justice: he will not afflict. 
\q1
\v 24 Men do therefore fear him: 
\q1 He respecteth not any \add that are\add* wise of heart. 
\c 38  
\p
\v 1 Then the \sc Lord\sc* answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said, 
\q1
\v 2 Who \add is\add* this that darkeneth counsel 
\q1 By words without knowledge? 
\q1
\v 3 Gird up now thy loins like a man; 
\q1 For I will demand of thee, and answer thou me. 
\b
\q1
\v 4 Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? 
\q1 Declare, if thou hast understanding. 
\q1
\v 5 Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? 
\q1 Or who hath stretched the line upon it? 
\q1
\v 6 Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? 
\q1 Or who laid the corner stone thereof; 
\q1
\v 7 When the morning stars sang together, 
\q1 And all the sons of God shouted for joy? 
\b
\q1
\v 8 Or \add who\add* shut up the sea with doors, 
\q1 When it brake forth, \add as if\add* it had issued out of the womb? 
\q1
\v 9 When I made the cloud the garment thereof, 
\q1 And thick darkness a swaddling band for it, 
\q1
\v 10 And brake up for it my decreed \add place\add*, 
\q1 And set bars and doors, 
\q1
\v 11 And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: 
\q1 And here shall thy proud waves be stayed? 
\b
\q1
\v 12 Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; 
\q1 \add And\add* caused the dayspring to know his place; 
\q1
\v 13 That \add it\add* might take hold of the ends of the earth, 
\q1 That the wicked might be shaken out of it? 
\q1
\v 14 It is turned as clay \add to\add* the seal; 
\q1 And they stand as a garment. 
\q1
\v 15 And from the wicked their light is withholden, 
\q1 And the high arm shall be broken. 
\b
\q1
\v 16 Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? 
\q1 Or hast thou walked in the search of the depth? 
\q1
\v 17 Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? 
\q1 Or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death? 
\q1
\v 18 Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? 
\q1 Declare if thou knowest it all. 
\q1
\v 19 Where \add is\add* the way \add where\add* light dwelleth? 
\q1 And \add as for\add* darkness, where \add is\add* the place thereof, 
\q1
\v 20 That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, 
\q1 And that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof? 
\q1
\v 21 Knowest thou \add it\add*, because thou wast then born? 
\q1 Or \add because\add* the number of thy days \add is\add* great? 
\b
\q1
\v 22 Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? 
\q1 Or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail, 
\q1
\v 23 Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, 
\q1 Against the day of battle and war? 
\q1
\v 24 By what way is the light parted, 
\q1 \add Which\add* scattereth the east wind upon the earth? 
\q1
\v 25 Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, 
\q1 Or a way for the lightning of thunder; 
\q1
\v 26 To cause it to rain on the earth, \add where\add* no man \add is;\add* 
\q1 \add On\add* the wilderness, wherein \add there is\add* no man; 
\q1
\v 27 To satisfy the desolate and waste \add ground;\add* 
\q1 And to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth? 
\b
\q1
\v 28 Hath the rain a father? 
\q1 Or who hath begotten the drops of dew? 
\q1
\v 29 Out of whose womb came the ice? 
\q1 And the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it? 
\q1
\v 30 The waters are hid as \add with\add* a stone, 
\q1 And the face of the deep is frozen. 
\b
\q1
\v 31 Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, 
\q1 Or loose the bands of Orion? 
\q1
\v 32 Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? 
\q1 Or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons? 
\q1
\v 33 Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? 
\q1 Canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth? 
\b
\q1
\v 34 Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, 
\q1 That abundance of waters may cover thee? 
\q1
\v 35 Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, 
\q1 And say unto thee, Here we \add are?\add* 
\q1
\v 36 Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? 
\q1 Or who hath given understanding to the heart? 
\q1
\v 37 Who can number the clouds in wisdom? 
\q1 Or who can stay the bottles of heaven, 
\q1
\v 38 When the dust groweth into hardness, 
\q1 And the clods cleave fast together? 
\b
\q1
\v 39 Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? 
\q1 Or fill the appetite of the young lions, 
\q1
\v 40 When they couch in \add their\add* dens, 
\q1 \add And\add* abide in the covert to lie in wait? 
\q1
\v 41 Who provideth for the raven his food? 
\q1 When his young ones cry unto God, 
\q1 They wander for lack of meat. 
\b
\c  39  
\q1
\v 1 Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? 
\q1 \add Or\add* canst thou mark when the hinds do calve? 
\q1
\v 2 Canst thou number the months \add that\add* they fulfil? 
\q1 Or knowest thou the time when they bring forth? 
\q1
\v 3 They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, 
\q1 They cast out their sorrows. 
\q1
\v 4 Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; 
\q1 They go forth, and return not unto them. 
\b
\q1
\v 5 Who hath sent out the wild ass free? 
\q1 Or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass? 
\q1
\v 6 Whose house I have made the wilderness, 
\q1 And the barren \add land\add* his dwellings. 
\q1
\v 7 He scorneth the multitude of the city, 
\q1 Neither regardeth he the crying of the driver. 
\q1
\v 8 The range of the mountains \add is\add* his pasture, 
\q1 And he searcheth after every green thing. 
\b
\q1
\v 9 Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, 
\q1 Or abide by thy crib? 
\q1
\v 10 Canst thou bind the unicorn \add with\add* his band in the furrow? 
\q1 Or will he harrow the valleys after thee? 
\q1
\v 11 Wilt thou trust him, because his strength \add is\add* great? 
\q1 Or wilt thou leave thy labour to him? 
\q1
\v 12 Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, 
\q1 And gather \add it into\add* thy barn? 
\b
\q1
\v 13  \add Gavest thou\add* the goodly wings unto the peacocks? 
\q1 Or wings and feathers \add unto\add* the ostrich? 
\q1
\v 14 Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, 
\q1 And warmeth them in dust, 
\q1
\v 15 And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, 
\q1 Or \add that\add* the wild beast may break them. 
\q1
\v 16 She is hardened against her young ones, as though \add they were\add* not hers: 
\q1 Her labour \add is\add* in vain without fear; 
\q1
\v 17 Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, 
\q1 Neither hath he imparted to her understanding. 
\q1
\v 18 What time she lifteth up herself on high, 
\q1 She scorneth the horse and his rider. 
\b
\q1
\v 19 Hast thou given the horse strength? 
\q1 Hast thou clothed his neck with thunder? 
\q1
\v 20 Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? 
\q1 The glory of his nostrils \add is\add* terrible. 
\q1
\v 21 He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in \add his\add* strength. 
\q1 He goeth on to meet the armed men. 
\q1
\v 22 He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; 
\q1 Neither turneth he back from the sword. 
\q1
\v 23 The quiver rattleth against him, 
\q1 The glittering spear and the shield. 
\q1
\v 24 He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: 
\q1 Neither believeth he that \add it is\add* the sound of the trumpet. 
\q1
\v 25 He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; 
\q1 And he smelleth the battle afar off, 
\q1 The thunder of the captains, and the shouting. 
\b
\q1
\v 26 Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, 
\q1 \add And\add* stretch her wings toward the south? 
\q1
\v 27 Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, 
\q1 And make her nest on high? 
\q1
\v 28 She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, 
\q1 Upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place. 
\q1
\v 29 From thence she seeketh the prey, 
\q1 \add And\add* her eyes behold afar off. 
\q1
\v 30 Her young ones also suck up blood: 
\q1 And where the slain \add are\add*, there \add is\add* she. 
\c 40  
\p
\v 1 Moreover the \sc Lord\sc* answered Job, and said, 
\q1
\v 2 Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct \add him?\add* 
\q1 He that reproveth God, let him answer it. 
\p
\v 3 Then Job answered the \sc Lord\sc*, and said, 
\q1
\v 4 Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? 
\q1 I will lay my hand upon my mouth. 
\q1
\v 5 Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: 
\q1 Yea, twice; but I will proceed no further. 
\p
\v 6 Then answered the \sc Lord\sc* unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said, 
\q1
\v 7 Gird up thy loins now like a man: 
\q1 I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me. 
\q1
\v 8 Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? 
\q1 Wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous? 
\q1
\v 9 Hast thou an arm like God? 
\q1 Or, canst thou thunder with a voice like him? 
\b
\q1
\v 10 Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency; 
\q1 And array thyself with glory and beauty. 
\q1
\v 11 Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: 
\q1 And behold every one \add that is\add* proud, and abase him. 
\q1
\v 12 Look on every one \add that is\add* proud, \add and\add* bring him low; 
\q1 And tread down the wicked in their place. 
\q1
\v 13 Hide them in the dust together; 
\q1 \add And\add* bind their faces in secret. 
\q1
\v 14 Then will I also confess unto thee 
\q1 That thine own right hand can save thee. 
\b
\q1
\v 15 Behold now behemoth, 
\q1 Which I made with thee; 
\q1 He eateth grass as an ox. 
\q1
\v 16 Lo now, his strength \add is\add* in his loins, 
\q1 And his force \add is\add* in the navel of his belly. 
\q1
\v 17 He moveth his tail like a cedar: 
\q1 The sinews of his stones are wrapt together. 
\q1
\v 18 His bones \add are as\add* strong pieces of brass; 
\q1 His bones \add are\add* like bars of iron. 
\b
\q1
\v 19 He \add is\add* the chief of the ways of God: 
\q1 He that made him can make his sword to approach \add unto him\add*. 
\q1
\v 20 Surely the mountains bring him forth food, 
\q1 Where all the beasts of the field play. 
\q1
\v 21 He lieth under the shady trees, 
\q1 In the covert of the reed, and fens. 
\q1
\v 22 The shady trees cover him \add with\add* their shadow; 
\q1 The willows of the brook compass him about. 
\q1
\v 23 Behold, he drinketh up a river, \add and\add* hasteth not: 
\q1 He trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth. 
\q1
\v 24 He taketh it with his eyes: 
\q1 \add His\add* nose pierceth through snares. 
\b
\c  41  
\q1
\v 1 Canst thou draw out leviathan with a hook? 
\q1 Or his tongue with a cord \add which\add* thou lettest down? 
\q1
\v 2 Canst thou put a hook into his nose? 
\q1 Or bore his jaw through with a thorn? 
\q1
\v 3 Will he make many supplications unto thee? 
\q1 Will he speak soft \add words\add* unto thee? 
\q1
\v 4 Will he make a covenant with thee? 
\q1 Wilt thou take him for a servant for ever? 
\q1
\v 5 Wilt thou play with him as \add with\add* a bird? 
\q1 Or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens? 
\b
\q1
\v 6 Shall the companions make a banquet of him? 
\q1 Shall they part him among the merchants? 
\q1
\v 7 Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? 
\q1 Or his head with fish spears? 
\q1
\v 8 Lay thine hand upon him, 
\q1 Remember the battle, do no more. 
\q1
\v 9 Behold, the hope of him is in vain: 
\q1 Shall \add not one\add* be cast down even at the sight of him? 
\b
\q1
\v 10 None \add is so\add* fierce that dare stir him up: 
\q1 Who then is able to stand before me? 
\q1
\v 11 Who hath prevented me, that I should repay \add him?\add* 
\q1 \add Whatsoever is\add* under the whole heaven \add is\add* mine. 
\b
\q1
\v 12 I will not conceal his parts, 
\q1 Nor \add his\add* power, nor his comely proportion. 
\q1
\v 13 Who can discover the face of his garment? 
\q1 \add Or\add* who can come \add to him\add* with his double bridle? 
\q1
\v 14 Who can open the doors of his face? 
\q1 His teeth \add are\add* terrible round about. 
\b
\q1
\v 15  \add His\add* scales \add are his\add* pride, 
\q1 Shut up \add together as with\add* a close seal. 
\q1
\v 16 One is so near to another, 
\q1 That no air can come between them. 
\q1
\v 17 They are joined one to another, 
\q1 They stick together, that they cannot be sundered. 
\b
\q1
\v 18  \add By\add* his neesings a light doth shine, 
\q1 And his eyes \add are\add* like the eyelids of the morning. 
\q1
\v 19 Out of his mouth go burning lamps, 
\q1 \add And\add* sparks of fire leap out. 
\q1
\v 20 Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, 
\q1 As \add out of\add* a seething pot or caldron. 
\q1
\v 21 His breath kindleth coals, 
\q1 And a flame goeth out of his mouth. 
\b
\q1
\v 22 In his neck remaineth strength, 
\q1 And sorrow is turned into joy before him. 
\q1
\v 23 The flakes of his flesh are joined together: 
\q1 They are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved. 
\q1
\v 24 His heart is as firm as a stone; 
\q1 Yea, as hard as a piece of the nether \add millstone\add*. 
\q1
\v 25 When he raiseth up \add himself\add*, the mighty are afraid: 
\q1 By reason of breakings they purify themselves. 
\b
\q1
\v 26 The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: 
\q1 The spear, the dart, nor the habergeon. 
\q1
\v 27 He esteemeth iron as straw, 
\q1 And \add brass\add* as rotten wood. 
\q1
\v 28 The arrow cannot make him flee: 
\q1 Slingstones are turned with him into stubble. 
\q1
\v 29 Darts are counted as stubble: 
\q1 He laugheth at the shaking of a spear. 
\b
\q1
\v 30 Sharp stones \add are\add* under him: 
\q1 He spreadeth sharp pointed \add things\add* upon the mire. 
\q1
\v 31 He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: 
\q1 He maketh the sea like a pot of ointment. 
\q1
\v 32 He maketh a path to shine after him; 
\q1 \add One\add* would think the deep to be hoary. 
\q1
\v 33 Upon earth there is not his like, 
\q1 Who is made without fear. 
\q1
\v 34 He beholdeth all high \add things:\add* 
\q1 He \add is\add* a king over all the children of pride. 
\c 42  
\p
\v 1 Then Job answered the \sc Lord\sc*, and said, 
\q1
\v 2 I know that thou canst do every \add thing\add*, 
\q1 And \add that\add* no thought can be withholden from thee. 
\q1
\v 3 Who \add is\add* he that hideth counsel 
\q1 Without knowledge? 
\q1 Therefore have I uttered that I understood not; 
\q1 \add Things\add* too wonderful for me, which I knew not. 
\b
\q1
\v 4 Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: 
\q1 I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me. 
\q1
\v 5 I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: 
\q1 But now mine eye seeth thee. 
\q1
\v 6 Wherefore I abhor \add myself\add*, and repent 
\q1 In dust and ashes. 
\p
\v 7 And it was \add so\add*, that after the \sc Lord\sc* had spoken these words unto Job, the \sc Lord\sc* said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me \add the thing that is\add* right, as my servant Job \add hath\add*. 
\v 8 Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest \add I\add* deal with you \add after your\add* folly, in that ye have not spoken of me \add the thing which is\add* right, like my servant Job. 
\v 9 So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite \add and\add* Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the \sc Lord\sc* commanded them: the \sc Lord\sc* also accepted Job. 
\v 10 And the \sc Lord\sc* turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the \sc Lord\sc* gave Job twice as much as he had before. 
\v 11 Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all \add they that had been of\add* his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the \sc Lord\sc* had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold. 
\p
\v 12 So the \sc Lord\sc* blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses. 
\v 13 He had also seven sons and three daughters. 
\v 14 And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Keren-happuch. 
\v 15 And in all the land were no women found \add so\add* fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren. 
\v 16 After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons’ sons, \add even\add* four generations. 
\v 17 So Job died, \add being\add* old and full of days.
