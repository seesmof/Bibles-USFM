\v 1  \sc The\sc* brethren, the Jews that be at Jerusalem and in the land of Judea, wish unto the brethren, the Jews that are throughout Egypt, health and peace: 
\v 2 God be gracious unto you, and remember his covenant that \add he made\add* with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, his faithful servants; 
\v 3 and give you all a heart to serve him, and to do his will, with a good courage and a willing mind; 
\v 4 and open your hearts in his law and commandments, and send \add you\add* peace, 
\v 5 and hear your prayers, and be at one with you, and never forsake you in time of trouble. 
\v 6 And now we be here praying for you. 
\v 7 What time as Demetrius reigned, in the hundred threescore and ninth year, we the Jews wrote unto you in the extremity of trouble that came upon us in those years, from the time that Jason and his company revolted from the holy land and kingdom, 
\v 8 and burnt the porch, and shed innocent blood: then we prayed unto the Lord, and were heard; we offered also sacrifices and fine flour, and lighted the lamps, and set forth the loaves. 
\v 9 And now \add see\add* that ye keep the feast of tabernacles in the month Casleu. 
\p
\v 10 In the hundred fourscore and eight year, the \add people\add* that were at Jerusalem and in Judea, and the council, and Judas, \add sent\add* greeting and health unto Aristobulus, king Ptolemeus’ master, who was of the stock of the anointed priests, and to the Jews that were in Egypt: 
\v 11 Insomuch as God hath delivered us from great perils, we thank him highly, as having been in battle against a king. 
\v 12 For he cast them out that fought within the holy city. 
\v 13 For when the leader was come into Persia, and the army with him that seemed invincible, they were slain in the temple of Nanea by the deceit of Nanea’s priests. 
\v 14 For Antiochus, as though he would marry her, came into the place, and his friends that were with him, to receive money in name of a dowry. 
\v 15 Which when the priests of Nanea had set forth, and he was entered with a small company into the compass of the temple, they shut the temple as soon as Antiochus was come in: 
\v 16  \add and\add* opening a privy door of the roof, they threw stones like thunderbolts, and stroke down the captain, hewed \add them\add* in pieces, smote off \add their\add* heads, and cast \add them\add* to those that were without. 
\v 17 Blessed \add be\add* our God in all \add things\add*, who hath delivered up the ungodly. 
\p
\v 18 Therefore whereas we are now purposed to keep the purification of the temple upon the five and twentieth \add day\add* of \add the month\add* Casleu, we thought it necessary to certify you \add thereof\add*, that ye also might keep \add it\add*, as \add the feast\add* of the tabernacles, and of the fire, \add which was given us\add* when Neemias offered sacrifice, after that he had builded the temple and the altar. 
\v 19 For when our fathers were led into Persia, the priests that were then devout took the fire of the altar privily, and hid \add it\add* in a hollow place of a pit without water, where they kept \add it\add* sure, so that the place was unknown to all men. 
\v 20 Now after many years, when it pleased God, Neemias, being sent from the king of Persia, did send \add of\add* the posterity of \add those\add* priests that had hid \add it\add* to the fire: but when they told us \add they\add* found no fire, but thick water; 
\v 21  \add then\add* commanded he them to draw \add it\add* up, and to bring \add it;\add* and when the sacrifices were laid on, Neemias commanded the priests to sprinkle the wood and the \add things\add* laid \add there\add*upon with the water. 
\v 22 When this was done, and the time came that the sun shone, which afore was hid in the cloud, there was a great fire kindled, so that every \add man\add* marvelled. 
\v 23 And the priests made a prayer whilst the sacrifice was consuming, \add I say\add*, both the priests, and all \add the rest\add*, Jonathan beginning, and the rest answering \add there\add*unto, as Neemias \add did\add*. 
\v 24 And the prayer was after this manner; 
\p O Lord, Lord God, Creator of all \add things, who art\add* fearful and strong, and righteous, and merciful, and the only and gracious King, 
\v 25 the only giver \add of all things\add*, the only just, Almighty, and everlasting, thou that deliverest Israel from all trouble, and didst choose the fathers, and sanctify them: 
\v 26 receive the sacrifice for thy whole people Israel, and preserve thine own portion, and sanctify \add it\add*. 
\v 27 Gather those together that are scattered from us, deliver them that serve among the heathen, look upon them that are despised and abhorred, and let the heathen know that thou art our God. 
\v 28 Punish them that oppress \add us\add*, and with pride do \add us\add* wrong. 
\v 29 Plant thy people \add again\add* in thy holy place, as Moses hath spoken. 
\p
\v 30 And the priests sung psalms \add of thanksgiving\add*. 
\v 31 Now when the sacrifice was consumed, Neemias commanded the water that was left to be poured on the great stones. 
\v 32 When this was done, there was kindled a flame: but it was consumed by the light that shined from the altar. 
\v 33 So when \add this\add* matter was known, it was told the king of Persia, that in the place, where the priests that were led away had hid the fire, there appeared water, and that Neemias had purified the sacrifices therewith. 
\v 34 Then the king, inclosing the place, made \add it\add* holy, after he had tried the matter. 
\v 35 And the king took many gifts, and bestowed \add thereof on those\add* whom he would gratify. 
\v 36 And Neemias called this \add thing\add* Naphthar, which is as much as to say, a cleansing: but many \add men\add* call it Nephi. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 It is also found in the records, that Jeremie the prophet commanded them that were carried away to take of the fire, as it hath been signified: 
\v 2 and how that the prophet, having given them the law, charged them not to forget the commandments of the Lord, and that they should not err in \add their\add* minds, when they see images of silver and gold, with their ornaments. 
\v 3 And with other such speeches exhorted he \add them\add*, that the law should not depart from their hearts. 
\v 4 It was also \add contained\add* in the \add same\add* writing, that the prophet, being warned of God, commanded the tabernacle and the ark to go with him, as he went forth into the mountain, where Moses climbed up, and saw the heritage of God. 
\v 5 And when Jeremie came \add thither\add*, he found a hollow cave, wherein he laid the tabernacle, and the ark, and the altar of incense, and \add so\add* stopped the door. 
\v 6 And some of those that followed \add him\add* came to mark the way, but they could not find \add it\add*. 
\v 7 Which when Jeremie perceived, he blamed them, saying, As for \add that\add* place, it shall be unknown until \add the time\add* that God gather \add his\add* people \add again\add* together, and receive \add them\add* unto mercy. 
\v 8 Then shall the Lord shew \add them\add* these \add things\add*, and the glory of the Lord shall appear, and the cloud \add also\add*, as it was shewed under Moses, and as when Solomon desired that the place might be honourably sanctified. 
\v 9 It was also declared, that he being wise offered the sacrifice of dedication, and of the finishing of the temple. 
\v 10 And as when Moses prayed unto the Lord, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the sacrifices: \add even\add* so prayed Solomon also, and the fire came down \add from heaven\add*, and consumed the burnt offerings. 
\v 11 And Moses said, Because the sin offering was not to be eaten, it was consumed. 
\v 12 So Solomon kept \add those\add* eight days. 
\p
\v 13 The same \add things\add* also were reported in the writings and commentaries of Neemias; and how he founding a library gathered together the acts of the kings, and the prophets, and of David, and the epistles of the kings concerning the holy gifts. 
\v 14 In like manner also Judas gathered together all those \add things\add* that were lost by reason of the war we had, and they remain with us, 
\v 15 Wherefore if ye have need thereof, send \add some\add* to fetch them unto you. 
\v 16 Whereas we then are about to celebrate the purification, we have written unto you, and ye shall do well, if ye keep the \add same\add* days. 
\v 17 We hope also, that the God, that delivered all his people, and gave \add them\add* all an heritage, and the kingdom, and the priesthood, and the sanctuary, 
\v 18 as he promised in the law, will shortly have mercy upon us, and gather \add us\add* together out of every \add land\add* under heaven into the holy place: for he hath delivered us out of great troubles, and hath purified the place. 
\p
\v 19 Now as concerning Judas Maccabeus, and his brethren, and the purification of the great temple, and the dedication of the altar, 
\v 20 and the wars against Antiochus Epiphanes, and Eupator his son, 
\v 21 and the manifest signs that came from heaven unto those that behaved themselves manfully to their honour for Judaism: so that, being but a few, they overcame the whole country, and chased barbarous multitudes, 
\v 22 and recovered again the temple renowned all the world over, and freed the city, and upheld the laws which were going down, the Lord being gracious unto them with all favour: 
\v 23  \add all these things, I say\add*, being declared by Jason of Cyrene in five books, we will assay to abridge in one volume. 
\v 24 For considering the infinite number, and the difficulty which they find that desire to look into the narrations of the story, for the variety of the matter, 
\v 25 we have been careful, that they that will read may have delight, and that they that are desirous to commit to memory might have ease, and that all into whose hands \add it\add* comes might have profit. 
\v 26 Therefore to us, that have taken upon us \add this\add* painful labour of abridging, \add it was\add* not easy, but a matter of sweat and watching; 
\v 27 even as \add it is\add* no ease unto him that prepareth a banquet, and seeketh the benefit of others: yet for the pleasuring of many we will undertake gladly \add this\add* great pains; 
\v 28 leaving to the author the exact handling of every \add particular\add*, and labouring to follow the rules of an abridgement. 
\v 29 For as the master builder of a new house must care for the whole building; but he that undertaketh to set \add it\add* out, and paint \add it\add*, must seek out fit \add things\add* for the adorning \add thereof:\add* even so I think \add it is\add* with us. 
\v 30 To stand upon \add every point\add*, and go over \add things\add* at large, and to be curious in particulars, belongeth to the first author of the story: 
\v 31 but to use brevity, and avoid much labouring of the work, \add is\add* to be granted to him that will make an abridgment. 
\v 32 Here then will we begin the story: \add only\add* adding thus much to that which hath been said, That \add it is\add* a foolish \add thing\add* to make a long prologue, and to be short in the story \add itself\add*. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 Now when the holy city was inhabited with all peace, and the laws were kept very well, because of the godliness of Onias the high priest, and \add his\add* hatred of wickedness, 
\v 2 it came to pass that even the kings themselves did honour the place, and magnify the temple with \add their\add* best gifts; 
\v 3 insomuch that Seleucus king of Asia of his own revenues bare all the costs belonging to the service of the sacrifices. 
\v 4 But one Simon of the tribe of Benjamin, \add who was\add* made governor of the temple, fell out with the high priest about disorder in the city. 
\v 5 And when he could not overcome Onias, he gat him to Apollonius \add the son\add* of Thraseas, who then was governor of Coelosyria and Phenice, 
\v 6 and told \add him\add* that the treasury in Jerusalem was full of infinite sums of money, so that the multitude of \add their\add* riches, which did not pertain to the account of the sacrifices, was innumerable, and that it was possible to bring all into the king’s hand. 
\v 7 Now when Apollonius came to the king, and had shewed \add him\add* of the money whereof he was told, \add the king\add* chose out Heliodorus his treasurer, and sent \add him\add* with a commandment to bring \add him\add* the foresaid money. 
\v 8 So forthwith Heliodorus took \add his\add* journey, under a colour of visiting the cities of Coelosyria and Phenice, but indeed to fulfil the king’s purpose. 
\v 9 And when he was come to Jerusalem, and had been courteously received of the high priest of the city, he told \add him\add* what intelligence was given \add of the money\add*, and declared wherefore he came, and asked if these \add things\add* were so indeed. 
\v 10 Then the high priest told \add him\add* that there was such money laid up for the relief of widows and fatherless children: 
\v 11 and that some \add of it belonged\add* to Hircanus \add son\add* of Tobias, a man of great dignity, \add and\add* not as \add that\add* wicked Simon had misinformed: the sum \add whereof\add* in all \add was\add* four hundred talents of silver, and two hundred of gold: 
\v 12 and that it was altogether impossible that \add such\add* wrong should be done unto them, that had committed \add it\add* to the holiness of the place, and to the majesty and inviolable sanctity of the temple, honoured over all the world. 
\v 13 But Heliodorus, because of the king’s commandment given him, said, That in any wise it must be brought into the king’s \add treasury\add*. 
\p
\v 14 So at the day which he appointed he entered in to order this matter: wherefore there was no small agony throughout the whole city. 
\v 15 But the priests, prostrating themselves before the altar in \add their\add* priests’ vestments, called unto heaven upon him that made a law concerning things given to be kept, that they should safely be preserved for such as had committed \add them\add* to be kept. 
\v 16 Then \add whoso\add* had looked the high priest in the face, it would have wounded \add his\add* heart: for \add his\add* countenance and the changing of \add his\add* colour declared the \add inward\add* agony of \add his\add* mind. 
\v 17 For the man was \add so\add* compassed with fear and horror of the body, that it was manifest to them that looked \add upon him\add*, what sorrow he had now in \add his\add* heart. 
\v 18 Others ran flocking out of \add their\add* houses to the general supplication, because the place was like to come into contempt. 
\v 19 And the women, girt with sackcloth under \add their\add* breasts, abounded in the streets, and the virgins that were kept in ran, some to the gates, and some to the walls, and others looked out of the windows. 
\v 20 And all, holding \add their\add* hands towards heaven, made supplication. 
\v 21 Then it would have pitied \add a man to see\add* the falling down of the multitude of all sorts, and the fear of the high priest, being in \add such\add* an agony. 
\v 22 They then called upon the Almighty Lord to keep the \add things\add* committed of trust safe and sure for those that had committed \add them\add*. 
\v 23 Nevertheless Heliodorus executed that which was decreed. 
\p
\v 24 Now as he was there present himself with \add his\add* guard about the treasury, the Lord of spirits, and the Prince of all power, caused a great apparition, so that all that presumed to come in with \add him\add* were astonished at the power of God, and fainted, and were sore afraid. 
\v 25 For there appeared unto them a horse with a terrible rider upon him, and adorned with a very fair covering, and he ran fiercely, and smote at Heliodorus with his forefeet, and it seemed that he that sat upon \add the horse\add* had complete harness of gold. 
\v 26 Moreover two other young men appeared before him, notable in strength, excellent in beauty, and comely in apparel, who stood by \add him\add* on either side, and scourged him continually, and gave him many \add sore\add* stripes. 
\v 27 And \add Heliodorus\add* fell suddenly unto the ground, and was compassed with great darkness: but they \add that were with him\add* took \add him\add* up, and put \add him\add* into a litter. 
\v 28  \add Thus\add* him, that lately came with a great train and with all \add his\add* guard into the said treasury, they carried \add out\add*, being unable to help himself with \add his\add* weapons: and manifestly they acknowledged the power of God: 
\v 29 for he by the hand of God was cast down, and \add lay\add* speechless without all hope of life. 
\v 30 But they praised the Lord, that had miraculously honoured his own place: for the temple, which a little afore was full of fear and trouble, when the Almighty Lord appeared, was filled with joy and gladness. 
\p
\v 31 Then straightways certain of Heliodorus’ friends prayed Onias, that \add he\add* would call upon the most High to grant him his life, who lay ready to give up the ghost. 
\v 32 So the high priest, suspecting lest the king should misconceive that some treachery had been done to Heliodorus by the Jews, offered a sacrifice for the health of the man. 
\v 33 Now as the high priest was making an atonement, the same young men in the same clothing appeared and stood \add beside\add* Heliodorus, saying, Give Onias the high priest great thanks, insomuch as for his sake the Lord hath granted thee life: 
\v 34 and seeing that thou hast been scourged from heaven, declare unto all \add men\add* the mighty power of God. And when they had spoken these \add words\add*, they appeared no \add more\add*. 
\v 35 So Heliodorus, after he had offered sacrifice unto the Lord, and made great vows unto him that had saved his life, and saluted Onias, returned with his host to the king. 
\v 36 Then testified he to all \add men\add* the works of the great God, which he had seen with his eyes. 
\v 37 And when the king asked Heliodorus, who might be a fit \add man\add* to be sent yet once \add again\add* to Jerusalem, he said, 
\v 38 If thou hast any enemy or traitor, send him thither, and thou shalt receive him well scourged, if he escape with his life: for in \add that\add* place, no doubt, there is an especial power of God. 
\v 39 For he that dwelleth in heaven hath his eye on that place, and defendeth \add it;\add* and he beateth and destroyeth them that come to hurt \add it\add*. 
\v 40 And the \add things\add* concerning Heliodorus, and the keeping of the treasury, fell out on this sort. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1  \add This\add* Simon now, of whom \add we\add* spake afore, having been a bewrayer of the money, and of \add his\add* country, slandered Onias, as if he had terrified Heliodorus, and been the worker of \add these\add* evils. 
\v 2 Thus was he bold to call \add him\add* a traitor, that had deserved well of the city, and tendred \add his\add* own nation, and was \add so\add* zealous of the laws. 
\v 3 But when \add their\add* hatred went so far, that by one of Simon’s faction murders were committed, 
\v 4 Onias seeing the danger of \add this\add* contention, and that Apollonius, as \add being\add* the governor of Coelosyria and Phenice, did rage, and increase Simon’s malice, 
\v 5 he went to the king, not to be an accuser of \add his\add* countrymen, but seeking the good of all, \add both\add* publick and private: 
\v 6 for he saw that it was impossible that the state should continue quiet, and Simon leave \add his\add* folly, unless the king did look \add thereunto\add*. 
\p
\v 7 But after the death of Seleucus, when Antiochus, called Epiphanes, took the kingdom, Jason the brother of Onias laboured underhand to be high priest, 
\v 8 promising unto the king by intercession three hundred and threescore talents of silver, and of another revenue eighty talents: 
\v 9 beside this, he promised to assign an hundred and fifty more, if he might have licence to set him up a place for exercise, and for the training up of youth in the fashions of the heathen, and to write them of Jerusalem \add by the name of\add* Antiochians. 
\v 10 Which when the king had granted, and he had gotten into his hand the rule, he forthwith brought \add his\add* own nation to the Greekish fashion. 
\v 11 And the royal \add privileges\add* granted of special favour to the Jews by the means of John the father of Eupolemus, who went ambassador to Rome for amity and aid, he took away; and putting down the governments \add which were\add* according to the law, he brought up new customs against the law: 
\v 12 for he built gladly a place of exercise under the tower itself, and brought the chief young men under \add his\add* subjection, and made \add them\add* wear a hat. 
\p
\v 13 Now such was the height of Greek fashions, and increase of heathenish manners, through the exceeding profaneness of Jason, \add that\add* ungodly wretch, and no high priest; 
\v 14 that the priests had no courage to serve any more at the altar, but despising the temple, and neglecting the sacrifices, hastened to be partakers of the unlawful allowance in the place of exercise, after the game of Discus called \add them\add* forth; 
\v 15 not setting by the honours of \add their\add* fathers, but liking the glory of the Grecians best \add of all\add*. 
\v 16 By reason whereof sore calamity came upon them: for they had them \add to be their\add* enemies and avengers, whose custom they followed \add so\add* earnestly, and \add unto whom\add* they desired to be like in all \add things\add*. 
\v 17 For \add it is\add* not a light \add thing\add* to do wickedly against the laws of God: but the time following shall declare these \add things\add*. 
\p
\v 18 Now when the game that was used every fifth year was kept at Tyrus, the king being present, 
\v 19  \add this\add* ungracious Jason sent special messengers from Jerusalem, who were Antiochians, to carry three hundred drachms of silver to the sacrifice of Hercules, which even the bearers \add thereof\add* thought fit not to bestow upon the sacrifice, because it was not convenient, but to be reserved for other charges. 
\v 20 This \add money\add* then, in regard of the sender, was appointed to Hercules’ sacrifice; but because of the bearers \add thereof, it was employed\add* to the making of gallies. 
\p
\v 21 Now when Apollonius the \add son\add* of Menestheus was sent into Egypt for the coronation of king Ptolemeus Philometor, Antiochus, understanding him not to be well affected to his affairs, provided for his own safety: whereupon he came to Joppe, and from thence to Jerusalem: 
\v 22 where he was honourably received of Jason, and \add of\add* the city, and was brought in with torchlight, and with \add great\add* shoutings: \add and\add* so afterward went with his host unto Phenice. 
\p
\v 23 Three year afterward Jason sent Menelaus, the foresaid Simon’s brother, to bear the money unto the king, and to put \add him\add* in mind of certain necessary matters. 
\v 24 But he being brought to the presence of the king, when he had magnified him for the \add glorious\add* appearance of \add his\add* power, got the priesthood to himself, offering more than Jason \add by\add* three hundred talents of silver. 
\v 25 So he came with the king’s mandate, bringing nothing worthy the high priesthood, but having the fury of a cruel tyrant, and the rage of a savage beast. 
\v 26 Then Jason, who had undermined his own brother, being undermined by another, was compelled to flee into the country of the Ammonites. 
\v 27 So Menelaus got the principality: but \add as for\add* the money that \add he\add* had promised unto the king, he took no good order for \add it\add*, albeit Sostratus the ruler of the castle required it: 
\v 28 for unto him appertained the gathering of the customs. Wherefore they were both called before the king. 
\v 29 Now Menelaus left his brother Lysimachus in \add his\add* stead in the priesthood; and Sostratus \add left\add* Crates, who was governor of the Cyprians. 
\v 30 While those \add things\add* were in doing, they of Tarsus and Mallos made insurrection, because \add they\add* were given to the king’s concubine, \add called\add* Antiochis. 
\v 31 Then came the king in all haste to appease matters, leaving Andronicus, a man in authority, for \add his\add* deputy. 
\p
\v 32 Now Menelaus, supposing that \add he\add* had gotten a convenient time, stole certain vessels of gold out of the temple, and gave \add some of them\add* to Andronicus, and some he sold into Tyrus and the cities round about. 
\v 33 Which when Onias knew of a surety, he reproved \add him\add*, and withdrew himself into a sanctuary at Daphne, that lieth by Antiochia. 
\v 34 Wherefore Menelaus, taking Andronicus apart, prayed \add him\add* to get Onias into his hands; who being persuaded \add thereunto\add*, and coming to Onias in deceit, gave \add him his\add* right hand with oaths; and though he were suspected \add by him, yet\add* persuaded he \add him\add* to come forth of the sanctuary: whom forthwith he shut up without regard of justice. 
\v 35 For the which cause not only the Jews, but many also of other nations, took great indignation, and were much grieved for the unjust murder of the man. 
\v 36 And when the king was come again from the places about Cilicia, the Jews that were in the city, and \add certain of\add* the Greeks that abhorred the fact \add also\add*, complained because Onias was slain without cause. 
\v 37 Therefore Antiochus was heartily sorry, and moved to pity, and wept, because of the sober and modest behaviour of him that was dead. 
\v 38 And being kindled with anger, forthwith he took away Andronicus his purple, and rent off \add his\add* clothes, and leading \add him\add* through the whole city unto \add that\add* very place, where he had committed impiety against Onias, there slew he the cursed murderer. Thus the Lord rewarded him his punishment, as he had deserved. 
\p
\v 39 Now when many sacrileges had been committed in the city by Lysimachus with the consent of Menelaus, and the bruit \add thereof\add* was spread abroad, the multitude gathered themselves together against Lysimachus, many vessels of gold being already carried away. 
\v 40 Whereupon the common people rising, and being filled with rage, Lysimachus armed about three thousand \add men\add*, and began first to offer violence; one Auranus being the leader, \add a man\add* far gone \add in\add* years, and no less \add in\add* folly. 
\v 41 They then seeing the attempt of Lysimachus, some of them caught stones, some clubs, others taking handfuls of dust, that was next at hand, cast \add them\add* all together upon Lysimachus, and those that set upon \add them\add*. 
\v 42 Thus many of them they wounded, and some they stroke to the ground, and all \add of them\add* they forced to flee: but \add as for\add* the church robber himself, \add him\add* they killed besides the treasury. 
\v 43 Of these \add matters\add* therefore there was an accusation laid against Menelaus. 
\p
\v 44 Now when the king came to Tyrus, three men that were sent from the senate pleaded the cause before him: 
\v 45 but Menelaus, being now convicted, promised Ptolemee the \add son\add* of Dorymenes \add to give him\add* much money, if \add he\add* would pacify the king \add towards him\add*. 
\v 46 Whereupon Ptolemee taking the king aside into a certain gallery, as it were to take the air, brought \add him\add* to be of another mind: 
\v 47 insomuch that he discharged Menelaus from the accusations, who notwithstanding was cause of all the mischief: and \add those\add* poor \add men\add*, who, if they had told \add their cause\add*, yea, before the Scythians, should have been judged innocent, them he condemned to death. 
\v 48 Thus they that followed the matter for the city, and \add for\add* the people, and \add for\add* the holy vessels, did soon suffer unjust punishment. 
\v 49 Wherefore even they of Tyrus, moved with hatred of that wicked deed, caused them to be honourably buried. 
\v 50 And \add so\add* through the covetousness of them that were in power Menelaus remained \add still\add* in authority, increasing in malice, \add and\add* being a great traitor to the citizens. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 About the same time Antiochus prepared \add his\add* second voyage into Egypt: 
\v 2 and \add then\add* it happened, that through all the city, for \add the space\add* almost \add of\add* forty days, there were seen horsemen running in the air, in cloth of gold, and armed \add with\add* lances, like a band of soldiers, 
\v 3 and troops of horsemen in array, encountering and running one against another, with shaking of shields, and multitude of pikes, and drawing of swords, and casting of darts, and glittering of golden ornaments, and harness of all sorts. 
\v 4 Wherefore every \add man\add* prayed that \add that\add* apparition might turn to good. 
\p
\v 5 Now when there was gone forth a false rumour, as though Antiochus had been dead, Jason took at the least a thousand \add men\add*, and suddenly made an assault upon the city; and they that were upon the walls being put back, and the city at length taken, Menelaus fled into the castle: 
\v 6 but Jason slew his own citizens without mercy, not considering that to get the day of them of \add his own\add* nation would be a most unhappy day \add for him;\add* but thinking they had been \add his\add* enemies, and not \add his\add* countrymen, whom he conquered. 
\v 7  \add Howbeit\add*, for all this he obtained not the principality, but at the last received shame for \add the reward of his\add* treason, and fled again into the country of the Ammonites. 
\v 8 In the end therefore he had an unhappy return, being accused before Aretas the king of the Arabians, fleeing from city to city, pursued of all \add men\add*, hated as a forsaker of the laws, and being had in abomination as an open enemy of \add his\add* country and countrymen, he was cast out into Egypt. 
\v 9 Thus he that had driven many out of \add their\add* country perished in a strange \add land\add*, retiring to the Lacedemonians, and thinking \add there\add* to find succour by reason of \add his\add* kindred: 
\v 10 and he that had cast out many unburied had none to mourn for him, nor any solemn funerals at all, nor sepulchre with \add his\add* fathers. 
\p
\v 11 Now when \add this\add* that was done came to the king’s ear, he thought that Judea had revolted: whereupon removing out of Egypt in a furious mind, he took the city by force of arms, 
\v 12 and commanded \add his\add* men of war not to spare such as they met, and to slay such as went up upon the houses. 
\v 13 Thus there was killing of young and old, making away of men, women, and children, slaying of virgins and infants. 
\v 14 And there were destroyed within \add the space of\add* three whole days fourscore thousand, whereof forty thousand were slain in the conflict; and no fewer sold than slain. 
\v 15 Yet was he not content with this, but presumed to go into the most holy temple of all the world; Menelaus, \add that\add* traitor to the laws, and to \add his own\add* country, being his guide: 
\v 16 and taking the holy vessels with polluted hands, and with profane hands pulling down the \add things\add* that were dedicated by other kings to the augmentation and glory and honour of the place, he gave \add them\add* away. 
\v 17 And \add so\add* haughty was Antiochus in mind, that he considered not that the Lord was angry for a while for the sins of them that dwelt in the city, \add and\add* therefore \add his\add* eye was not upon the place. 
\v 18 For had \add they\add* not been formerly wrapped in many sins, this \add man\add*, as soon as he had come, had forthwith been scourged, and put back from \add his\add* presumption, as Heliodorus \add was\add*, whom Seleucus the king sent to view the treasury. 
\v 19 Nevertheless God did not choose the people for the place’s sake, but the place for the people’s sake. 
\v 20 And therefore the place itself, that was partaker with \add them\add* of the adversities that happened to the nation, did afterward communicate in the benefits \add sent\add* from the Lord: and as it was forsaken in the wrath of the Almighty, \add so\add* again, the great Lord being reconciled, it was set up with all glory. 
\p
\v 21 So when Antiochus had carried out of the temple a thousand and eight hundred talents, he departed in all haste into Antiochia, weening in \add his\add* pride to make the land navigable, and the sea passable by foot: such was the haughtiness of \add his\add* mind. 
\v 22 And he left governors to vex the nation: at Jerusalem, Philip, for \add his\add* country a Phrygian, and for manners more barbarous than he that set \add him there;\add* 
\v 23 and at Garizim, Andronicus; and besides, Menelaus, who worse than all the rest bare a heavy hand over the citizens, having a malicious mind against \add his\add* countrymen the Jews. 
\v 24 He sent also \add that\add* detestable ringleader Apollonius with an army of two and twenty thousand, commanding \add him\add* to slay all those that were in their best age, and to sell the women and the younger \add sort:\add* 
\v 25 who coming to Jerusalem, and pretending peace, did forbear till the holy day of the sabbath, when taking the Jews keeping holy day, he commanded his men to arm themselves. 
\v 26 And \add so\add* he slew all them that were gone to the celebrating \add of the sabbath\add*, and running through the city with weapons slew great multitudes. 
\v 27 But Judas Maccabeus with nine others, or thereabout, withdrew himself into the wilderness, and lived in the mountains \add after\add* the manner of beasts, with his company, who fed on herbs continually, lest \add they\add* should be partakers of the pollution. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1 Not long after this the king sent an old man of Athens to compel the Jews to depart from the laws of \add their\add* fathers, and not to live after the laws of God: 
\v 2 and to pollute also the temple in Jerusalem, and to call \add it the temple\add* of Jupiter Olympius; and that in Garizim, of Jupiter the Defender of strangers, as they did desire that dwelt in the place. 
\v 3 The coming in of \add this\add* mischief was sore and grievous to the people: 
\v 4 for the temple was filled with riot and revelling by the Gentiles, who dallied with harlots, and had to do with women within the circuit of the holy \add places\add*, and besides that, brought in \add things\add* that were not lawful. 
\v 5 The altar also was filled with profane \add things\add*, which the law forbiddeth. 
\v 6 Neither was it \add lawful for a man\add* to keep sabbath days or ancient feasts, or to profess \add himself\add* at all to be a Jew. 
\v 7 And in the day of the king’s birth every month they were brought by bitter constraint to eat of the sacrifices; and when the feast of Bacchus was kept, the Jews were compelled to go in procession to Bacchus, carrying ivy. 
\v 8 Moreover there went out a decree to the neighbour cities of the heathen, by the suggestion of Ptolemee, against the Jews, that \add they\add* should observe the same fashions, and be partakers of \add their\add* sacrifices: 
\v 9 and whoso would not conform themselves to the \add manners\add* of the Gentiles should be put to death. Then might \add a man\add* have seen the present misery. 
\v 10 For there were two women brought, who had circumcised their children; whom when they had openly led round about the city, the babes hanging at their breasts, they cast them down headlong from the wall. 
\v 11 And others, that had run together into caves near by, to keep the sabbath day secretly, being discovered to Philip, were \add all\add* burnt together, because \add they\add* made a conscience to help themselves for the honour of the most sacred day. 
\p
\v 12 Now I beseech those that read this book, that \add they\add* be not discouraged for \add these\add* calamities, but that \add they\add* judge \add those\add* punishments not to be for destruction, but for a chastening of our nation. 
\v 13 For it is a token of \add his\add* great goodness, when wicked doers are not suffered \add any\add* long time, but forthwith punished. 
\v 14 For not as with other nations, \add whom\add* the Lord patiently forbeareth to punish, till they be come to the fulness of \add their\add* sins, so dealeth he with us, 
\v 15 lest that, being come to the height of sin, afterwards he should take vengeance of us. 
\v 16  \add And\add* therefore he never withdraweth his mercy from us: and though he punish with adversity, \add yet\add* doth he never forsake his people. 
\v 17 But let this that we have spoken be for a warning unto us. And \add now\add* will \add we\add* come to the declaring \add of the matter\add* in few \add words\add*. 
\p
\v 18 Eleazar, one of the principal scribes, an aged man, and of a well favoured countenance, was constrained to open his mouth, and to eat swine’s flesh. 
\v 19 But he, choosing rather to die gloriously, than to live \add stained\add* with \add such\add* an abomination, spit \add it\add* forth, and came of his own accord to the torment, 
\v 20 as it behoved \add them\add* to come, that are resolute to stand out \add against such things\add*, as \add are\add* not lawful for love of life to be tasted. 
\v 21 But they that had the charge of \add that\add* wicked feast, for the old acquaintance \add they\add* had with the man, taking him aside, besought \add him\add* to bring flesh of his own provision, such as \add was\add* lawful for him to use, and make as if he did eat of the flesh taken from the sacrifice commanded by the king; 
\v 22 that in so doing he might be delivered from death, and for the old friendship with them find favour. 
\v 23 But he began to consider discreetly, and as became \add his\add* age, and the excellency of \add his\add* ancient years, and the honour of \add his\add* gray head, whereunto he was come, and \add his\add* most honest education from a child, or rather the holy law made and given by God: therefore he answered accordingly, and willed \add them\add* straightways to send \add him\add* to the grave. 
\v 24 For it becometh not our age, \add said he, in any wise\add* to dissemble, whereby many young \add persons\add* might think that Eleazar, \add being\add* fourscore years old and ten, were \add now\add* gone to a strange religion; 
\v 25 and \add so\add* they through mine hypocrisy, and \add desire\add* to live a little \add time\add* and a moment \add longer\add*, should be deceived by me, and I get a stain to \add mine\add* old age, and make it abominable. 
\v 26 For though for the present \add time\add* I should be delivered from the punishment of men: yet should I not escape the hand of the Almighty, neither alive, nor dead. 
\v 27 Wherefore now, manfully changing \add this\add* life, I will shew myself such a one as \add mine\add* age requireth, 
\v 28 and leave a notable example to \add such as be\add* young to die willingly and courageously for the honourable and holy laws. And when he had said these \add words\add*, immediately he went to the torment: 
\v 29 they that led \add him\add* changing the good will they bare him a little before into hatred, because the foresaid speeches proceeded, as they thought, from a desperate mind. 
\v 30 But when he was ready to die with stripes, he groaned, and said, It is manifest unto the Lord, that hath the holy knowledge, that whereas I might have been delivered from death, I \add now\add* endure sore pains in body by being beaten: but in soul am well content to suffer these \add things\add*, because I fear him. 
\v 31 And thus this \add man\add* died, leaving his death for an example of a noble courage, and a memorial of virtue, not only unto young \add men\add*, but unto all \add his\add* nation. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1 It came to pass also, that seven brethren with \add their\add* mother were taken, and compelled by the king against the law to taste swine’s flesh, and were tormented with scourges and whips. 
\v 2 But one of them that spake first said thus, What wouldest thou ask or learn of us? we are ready to die, \add rather\add* than to transgress the laws of \add our\add* fathers. 
\v 3 Then the king, being in a rage, commanded pans and caldrons to be made hot: 
\v 4 which forthwith being heated, he commanded to cut out the tongue of him that spake first, and to cut off the utmost parts of his body, the rest of \add his\add* brethren and \add his\add* mother looking on. 
\v 5 Now when he was \add thus\add* maimed in all \add his members\add*, he commanded \add him\add* being \add yet\add* alive to be brought to the fire, and to be fried in the pan: and as the vapour of the pan was for a good \add space\add* dispersed, they exhorted one another with the mother to die manfully, saying thus, 
\v 6 The Lord God looketh upon \add us\add*, and in truth hath comfort in us, as Moses in his song, which witnessed to \add their\add* faces, declared, saying, And he shall be comforted in his servants. 
\v 7 So when the first was dead \add after\add* this manner, they brought the second to make \add him\add* a mocking stock: and when they had pulled off the skin of \add his\add* head with the hair, they asked \add him\add*, Wilt thou eat, before \add thou\add* be punished throughout every member of \add thy\add* body? 
\v 8 But he answered in his own language, and said, No. Wherefore he also received the next torment in order, as the former \add did\add*. 
\v 9 And when he was at the last gasp, he said, Thou \add like\add* a fury takest us out of \add this\add* present life, but the King of the world shall raise us up, who have died for his laws, unto everlasting life. 
\v 10 After him was the third made a mocking stock: and when he was required, he put out \add his\add* tongue, \add and that\add* right soon, holding forth \add his\add* hands manfully, 
\v 11 and said courageously, These I had from heaven; and for his laws I despise them; and from him I hope to receive them again. 
\v 12 Insomuch that the king, and they that were with him, marvelled at the young man’s courage, for that he nothing regarded the pains. 
\v 13 Now when this \add man\add* was dead also, they tormented and mangled the fourth in like manner. 
\v 14 So when he was ready to die he said thus, \add It is\add* good, being put to death by men, to look for hope from God to be raised up again by him: as for thee, thou shalt have no resurrection to life. 
\v 15 Afterward they brought the fifth also, and mangled \add him\add*. 
\v 16 Then looked he unto \add the king\add*, and said, Thou hast power over men, thou art corruptible, thou doest what thou wilt; yet think not that our nation is forsaken of God; 
\v 17 but abide a while, and behold his great power, how he will torment thee and thy seed. 
\v 18 After him also they brought the sixth, who being ready to die said, Be not deceived without cause: for we suffer these \add things\add* for ourselves, having sinned against our God: therefore marvellous \add things\add* are done \add unto us\add*. 
\v 19 But think not thou, that takest in hand to strive against God, that \add thou\add* shalt escape unpunished. 
\p
\v 20 But the mother \add was\add* marvellous above \add all\add*, and worthy of honourable memory: for when she saw \add her\add* seven sons slain within the space of one day, she bare \add it\add* with a good courage, because of the hope that she had in the Lord. 
\v 21 Yea, she exhorted every one of them in her own language, filled with courageous spirits; and stirring up \add her\add* womanish thoughts with a manly stomach, she said unto them, 
\v 22 I cannot tell how you came into my womb; for I neither gave you breath nor life, neither \add was it\add* I \add that\add* formed the members of every one \add of you;\add* 
\v 23 but doubtless the Creator of the world, who formed the generation of man, and found out the beginning of all \add things\add*, will also of \add his own\add* mercy give you breath and life again, as you now regard not your own selves for his laws’ sake. 
\p
\v 24 Now Antiochus, thinking himself despised, and suspecting it to be a reproachful speech, whiles the youngest was yet alive, did not only exhort \add him\add* by words, but also assured \add him\add* with oaths, that \add he\add* would make \add him\add* both a rich and a happy \add man\add*, if he would turn from the laws of \add his\add* fathers; and that \add also he\add* would take \add him\add* for \add his\add* friend, and trust \add him\add* with affairs. 
\v 25 But when the young man would in no case hearken unto \add him\add*, the king called \add his\add* mother, and exhorted \add her\add* that \add she\add* would counsel the young man to save \add his\add* life. 
\v 26 And when he had exhorted \add her\add* with many \add words\add*, she promised \add him\add* that \add she\add* would counsel \add her\add* son. 
\v 27 But she bowing herself toward him, laughing the cruel tyrant to scorn, spake in her country language on this manner; O \add my\add* son, have pity upon me that bare thee nine months in \add my\add* womb, and gave thee suck three years, and nourished thee, and brought \add thee\add* up unto this age, and endured the troubles of education. 
\v 28 I beseech thee, \add my\add* son, look upon the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, and consider that God made them of \add things\add* that were not; and so was mankind made likewise. 
\v 29 Fear not this tormentor, but, being worthy of thy brethren, take \add thy\add* death, that I may receive thee again in mercy with thy brethren. 
\v 30 Whiles she was yet speaking \add these words\add*, the young man said, 
\p Whom wait ye for? I will not obey the king’s commandment: but I will obey the commandment of the law that was given unto our fathers by Moses. 
\v 31 And thou, that hast been the author of all mischief against the Hebrews, shalt not escape the hands of God. 
\v 32 For we suffer because of our sins. 
\v 33 And though the living Lord be angry with us a little while for \add our\add* chastening and correction, yet shall he be at one again with his servants. 
\v 34 But thou, O godless \add man\add*, and of all other most wicked, be not lifted up without a cause, \add nor\add* puffed up with uncertain hopes, lifting up \add thy\add* hand against the servants of God: 
\v 35 for thou hast not yet escaped the judgment of Almighty God, who seeth \add all things\add*. 
\v 36 For our brethren, who now have suffered a short pain, are dead under God’s covenant of everlasting life: but thou, through the judgment of God, shalt receive just punishment for \add thy\add* pride. 
\v 37 But I, as my brethren, offer up \add my\add* body and life for the laws of \add our\add* fathers, beseeching God that \add he\add* would speedily be merciful unto \add our\add* nation; and that thou by torments and plagues mayest confess, that he alone is God; 
\v 38 and that in me and my brethren the wrath of the Almighty, which is justly brought upon all our nation, may cease. 
\p
\v 39 Then the king, being in a rage, handled him worse than all the rest, and took it grievously that \add he\add* was mocked. 
\v 40 So this \add man\add* died undefiled, and put his whole trust in the Lord. 
\v 41 Last of \add all after\add* the sons the mother died. 
\v 42 Let this be enough now to have spoken concerning the idolatrous feasts, and the extreme tortures. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1 Then Judas Maccabeus, and they that were with him, went privily into the towns, and called \add their\add* kinsfolks together, and took unto \add them all\add* such as continued in the Jews’ religion, and assembled about six thousand \add men\add*. 
\v 2 And they called upon the Lord, that \add he\add* would look upon the people that was trodden down of all; and also pity the temple profaned of ungodly men; 
\v 3 and that \add he\add* would have compassion upon the city, sore defaced, and ready to be made even with the ground; and hear the blood that cried unto him, 
\v 4 and remember the wicked slaughter of harmless infants, and the blasphemies committed against his name; and that \add he\add* would shew his hatred against the wicked. 
\v 5 Now when Maccabeus had his company about him, he could not be withstood by the heathen: for the wrath of the Lord was turned into mercy. 
\v 6 Therefore he came at unawares, and burnt up towns and cities, and got into his hands the \add most\add* commodious places, and overcame and put to flight no small number of \add his\add* enemies. 
\v 7  \add But\add* specially took he advantage of the night for such \add privy\add* attempts, insomuch that the bruit of his manliness was spread every where. 
\p
\v 8 So when Philip saw that \add this\add* man increased by little and little, and that things prospered with him \add still\add* more and more, he wrote unto Ptolemeus, the governor of Coelosyria and Phenice, to yield more aid to the king’s affairs. 
\v 9 Then forthwith choosing Nicanor the \add son\add* of Patroclus, \add one\add* of \add his\add* special friends, he sent \add him\add* with no fewer than twenty thousand of all nations under \add him\add*, to root out the whole generation of the Jews; and with him he joined also Gorgias a captain, who in matters of war had \add great\add* experience. 
\v 10 So Nicanor undertook to make so much money of the captive Jews, as should defray the tribute of two thousand talents, which the king was to pay to the Romans. 
\v 11 Wherefore immediately he sent to the cities upon the sea coast, proclaiming a sale of the captive Jews, \add and\add* promising that \add they\add* should have fourscore and ten bodies for \add one\add* talent, not expecting the vengeance that was to follow upon him from the Almighty \add God\add*. 
\v 12 Now when word was brought unto Judas of Nicanor’s coming, and he had imparted unto those that were with him that the army was at hand, 
\v 13 they that were fearful, and distrusted the justice of God, fled, and conveyed themselves away. 
\v 14 Others sold all that they had left, and withal besought the Lord to deliver them, being sold by the wicked Nicanor before \add they\add* met together: 
\v 15 and if not for their own sakes, yet for the covenants he had \add made\add* with their fathers, and for his holy and glorious name’s sake, by which they were called. 
\p
\v 16 So Maccabeus called his men together \add unto\add* the number of six thousand, and exhorted \add them\add* not to be stricken with terror of the enemy, nor to fear the great multitude of the heathen, who came wrongfully against them; but to fight manfully, 
\v 17 and to set before \add their\add* eyes the injury that they had unjustly done to the holy place, and the cruel handling of the city, whereof \add they\add* made a mockery, and also the taking away of the government of \add their\add* forefathers: 
\v 18 for they, said he, trust in \add their\add* weapons and boldness; but our confidence is in the Almighty God, who at a beck can cast down both them that come against us, and \add also\add* all the world. 
\v 19 Moreover he recounted unto them what helps their forefathers had found, and how they were delivered, when under Sennacherib an hundred fourscore and five thousand perished. 
\v 20 And \add he told them of\add* the battle that they had in Babylon with the Galatians, how they came \add but\add* eight thousand in all to the business, with four thousand Macedonians, \add and\add* that the Macedonians being perplexed, the eight thousand destroyed an hundred and twenty thousand because of the help that they had from heaven, and \add so\add* received a great booty. 
\v 21  \add Thus\add* when he had made them bold with these \add words\add*, and ready to die for the laws and the country, he divided \add his\add* army into four parts; 
\v 22 and joined \add with himself\add* his own brethren, leaders of each band, \add to wit\add*, Simon, and Joseph, and Jonathan, giving each one fifteen hundred \add men\add*. 
\v 23 Also \add he appointed\add* Eleazar to read the holy book: and when he had given \add them this\add* watchword, The help of God; himself leading the first band, he joined battle with Nicanor. 
\v 24 And by the help of the Almighty they slew above nine thousand of \add their\add* enemies, and wounded and maimed the most part of Nicanor’s host, and \add so\add* put all to flight; 
\v 25 and took their money that came to buy them, and pursued them far: but lacking time they returned: 
\v 26 for it was the \add day\add* before the sabbath, \add and\add* therefore they would no longer pursue them. 
\v 27 So when they had gathered their armour together, and spoiled \add their\add* enemies, they occupied themselves about the sabbath, yielding exceeding praise and thanks to the Lord, who had preserved them unto that day, \add which was\add* the beginning of mercy distilling upon them. 
\v 28 And after the sabbath, when they had given part of the spoils to the maimed, and the widows, and orphans, the residue they divided among themselves and \add their\add* servants. 
\v 29 When this was done, and they had made a common supplication, they besought the merciful Lord to be reconciled with his servants for ever. 
\p
\v 30 Moreover of those that were with Timotheus and Bacchides, who fought against \add them\add*, they slew above twenty thousand, and very easily got high \add and\add* strong holds, and divided amongst themselves many spoils \add more\add*, and made the maimed, orphans, widows, yea, and the aged also, equal in spoils with themselves. 
\v 31 And when they had gathered their armour together, they laid \add them\add* up all carefully in convenient places, and the remnant of the spoils they brought to Jerusalem. 
\v 32 They slew also Philarches, \add that\add* wicked person, who was with Timotheus, and had annoyed the Jews many \add ways\add*. 
\v 33 Furthermore at such time as they kept the feast for the victory in \add their\add* country, they burnt Callisthenes, that had set fire upon the holy gates, who was fled into a little house; and \add so\add* he received a reward meet for \add his\add* wickedness. 
\v 34 As for \add that\add* most ungracious Nicanor, who had brought a thousand merchants to buy the Jews, 
\v 35 he was through the help of the Lord brought down by them, of whom he made least account; and putting off \add his\add* glorious apparel, and discharging his company, he came like a fugitive servant through the midland unto Antioch, having very great dishonour, for that \add his\add* host was destroyed. 
\v 36 Thus he, that took upon him to make good to the Romans \add their\add* tribute by means of the captives in Jerusalem, told abroad, that the Jews had God to fight for them, and therefore they could not be hurt, because \add they\add* followed the laws that he gave \add them\add*. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 About that time came Antiochus with dishonour out of the country of Persia. 
\v 2 For he had entered the \add city\add* called Persepolis, and went about to rob the temple, and to hold the city; whereupon the multitude running to defend themselves with \add their\add* weapons put them to flight; and \add so\add* it happened, that Antiochus being put to flight of the inhabitants returned with shame. 
\v 3 Now when he came to Ecbatana, news was brought him what had happened unto Nicanor and Timotheus. 
\v 4 Then swelling with anger, he thought to avenge upon the Jews the disgrace \add done unto him\add* by those that made him flee. Therefore commanded he \add his\add* chariot man to drive without ceasing, and to dispatch the journey, the judgment of God now following him. For he had spoken proudly in this sort, That he would come to Jerusalem, and make it a common burying place of the Jews. 
\v 5 But the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, smote him with an incurable and invisible plague: for as soon as he had spoken \add these\add* words, a pain of the bowels \add that was\add* remediless came upon him, and sore torments of the inner \add parts;\add* 
\v 6  \add and that\add* most justly: for he had tormented other \add men\add*’s bowels with many and strange torments. 
\v 7 Howbeit he nothing at all ceased from \add his\add* bragging, but still was filled with pride, breathing out fire in \add his\add* rage against the Jews, and commanding to haste the journey: but it came to pass that he fell \add down\add* from \add his\add* chariot, carried violently; so that having a sore fall, all the members of \add his\add* body were much pained. 
\v 8 And \add thus\add* he that a little afore thought \add he\add* might command the waves of the sea, (so proud was he beyond the condition of man) and weigh the high mountains in a balance, was \add now\add* cast on the ground, and carried in a \add horse\add* litter, shewing forth unto all the manifest power of God. 
\v 9 So that the worms rose up out of the body of \add this\add* wicked \add man\add*, and whiles he lived in sorrow and pain, his flesh fell away, and the filthiness of his smell was noisome to all \add his\add* army. 
\v 10 And the \add man\add*, that thought a little afore \add he\add* could reach to the stars of heaven, no \add man\add* could endure to carry for \add his\add* intolerable stink. 
\p
\v 11 Here therefore, being plagued, he began to leave off \add his\add* great pride, and to come to the knowledge \add of himself\add* by the scourge of God, \add his\add* pain increasing every moment. 
\v 12 And when he himself could not abide his own smell, he said these \add words\add*, \add It is\add* meet to be subject unto God, and that a \add man\add* that is mortal should not proudly think \add of himself\add*, as if he were God. 
\v 13  \add This\add* wicked \add person\add* vowed also unto the Lord, who now no more would have mercy upon him, saying thus, 
\v 14 That the holy city (to the which he was going in haste, to lay \add it\add* even with the ground, and to make \add it\add* a common burying place,) \add he\add* would set at liberty: 
\v 15 and \add as touching\add* the Jews, whom he had judged not worthy so much as to be buried, but to be cast out with \add their\add* children to be devoured of the fowls \add and\add* wild beasts, \add he\add* would make them all equals to the citizens of Athens: 
\v 16 and the holy temple, which before he had spoiled, \add he\add* would garnish with goodly gifts, and restore all the holy vessels with many more, and out of his own revenue defray the charges belonging to the sacrifices: 
\v 17 yea, and that also \add he\add* would become a Jew \add himself\add*, and go through all the world \add that was\add* inhabited, and declare the power of God. 
\v 18 But for all this \add his\add* pains would not cease: for the just judgment of God was come upon him: \add therefore\add* despairing of his health, he wrote unto the Jews the letter underwritten, containing the form of a supplication, after this manner: 
\p
\v 19 Antiochus, king and governor, to the good Jews \add his\add* citizens \add wisheth\add* much joy, health, and prosperity: 
\v 20 If ye and \add your\add* children fare well, and your \add affairs\add* be to your contentment, I give very great thanks to God, having \add my\add* hope in heaven. 
\v 21 As for me, I was weak, \add or else\add* I would have remembered kindly your honour and good will. Returning out of Persia, and being taken with a grievous disease, I thought it necessary to care for the common safety of all: 
\v 22 not distrusting mine health, but having great hope to escape \add this\add* sickness. 
\v 23 But considering that even \add my\add* father, at what time he led an army into the high countries, appointed a successor, 
\v 24 to the end that, if any \add thing\add* fell out contrary to expectation, or if any \add tidings\add* were brought \add that were\add* grievous, they of the land, knowing to whom the state was left, might not be troubled: 
\v 25 again, considering how that the princes that are borderers and neighbours unto \add my\add* kingdom wait for opportunities, and expect what shall be the event, I have appointed my son Antiochus king, whom I often committed and commended unto many of you, when I went up into the high provinces; to whom I have written as followeth: 
\v 26 therefore I pray and request you to remember the benefits \add that I have done unto you\add* generally, and in special, and that every man will be still faithful to me and my son. 
\v 27 For I am persuaded that he understanding my mind will favourably and graciously yield to your desires. 
\p
\v 28 Thus the murderer and blasphemer having suffered most grievously, as he entreated other \add men\add*, \add so\add* died he a miserable death in a strange \add country\add* in the mountains. 
\v 29 And Philip, that was brought up with him, carried away \add his\add* body, who also fearing the son of Antiochus went into Egypt to Ptolemeus Philometor. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1 Now Maccabeus and his company, the Lord guiding them, recovered the temple and the city: 
\v 2 but the altars which the heathen had built in the open street, and also the chapels, they pulled down. 
\v 3 And having cleansed the temple they made another altar, and striking stones they took fire out of them, and offered a sacrifice after two years, and set forth incense, and lights, and shewbread. 
\v 4 When that was done, they fell flat down, and besought the Lord that \add they\add* might come no more into such troubles; but if they sinned any more \add against him\add*, that he himself would chasten them with mercy, and that \add they\add* might not be delivered unto the blasphemous and barbarous nations. 
\v 5 Now upon the \add same\add* day that the strangers profaned the temple, on the \add very\add* same day it was cleansed \add again\add*, \add even\add* the five and twentieth \add day\add* of the same month, which is Casleu. 
\v 6 And they kept eight days with gladness, as in \add the feast of\add* the tabernacles, remembering that not long afore \add they had held\add* the feast of the tabernacles, when as they wandered in the mountains and dens like beasts. 
\v 7 Therefore they bare branches, and fair boughs, and palms also, and sang psalms unto him that had given \add them\add* good success in cleansing his place. 
\v 8 They ordained also by a common statute and decree, That every year those days should be kept of the whole nation of the Jews. 
\v 9 And this was the end of Antiochus, called Epiphanes. 
\p
\v 10 Now will we declare the \add acts\add* of Antiochus Eupator, who was the son of \add this\add* wicked \add man\add*, gathering briefly the calamities of the wars. 
\v 11 So when he was come to the crown, he set one Lysias over the affairs \add of his realm\add*, and \add appointed him\add* chief governor of Coelosyria and Phenice. 
\v 12 For Ptolemeus, that was called Macron, choosing rather to do justice unto the Jews for the wrong that had been done unto them, endeavoured to continue peace with them. 
\v 13 Whereupon being accused of \add the king’s\add* friends before Eupator, and called traitor at every word, because \add he\add* had left Cyprus, that Philometor had committed unto him, and departed to Antiochus Epiphanes, and \add seeing\add* that he was in no honourable place, he was so discouraged, that he poisoned himself and died. 
\p
\v 14 But when Gorgias was governor of the holds, he hired soldiers, and nourished war continually with the Jews: 
\v 15 and therewithal the Idumeans, having gotten into their hands the \add most\add* commodious holds, kept the Jews occupied, and receiving those that were banished from Jerusalem, they went about to nourish war. 
\v 16 Then they that were with Maccabeus made supplication, and besought God that he would be their helper; and \add so\add* they ran with violence upon the strong holds of the Idumeans, 
\v 17 and assaulting them strongly, they wan the holds, and kept off all that fought upon the wall, and slew all that fell into \add their hands\add*, and killed no fewer than twenty thousand. 
\v 18 And because certain, \add who were\add* no less than nine thousand, were fled together into two very strong castles, having all \add manner of things\add* convenient to \add sustain\add* the siege, 
\v 19 Maccabeus left Simon and Joseph, and Zaccheus also, and them that were with him, \add who were\add* enough to besiege them, and departed himself unto \add those\add* places which \add more\add* needed \add his\add* help. 
\v 20 Now they that were with Simon, being led with covetousness, were persuaded for money, (through certain of those that were in the castle,) and took seventy thousand drachms, and let some \add of them\add* escape. 
\v 21 But when \add it\add* was told Maccabeus what was done, he called the governors of the people together, and accused \add those men\add*, that they had sold \add their\add* brethren for money, and set \add their\add* enemies free \add to fight\add* against them. 
\v 22 So he slew those that were found traitors, and immediately took the two castles. 
\v 23 And having good success with \add his\add* weapons in all \add things he\add* took in hand, he slew in the two holds more than twenty thousand. 
\p
\v 24 Now Timotheus, whom the Jews had overcome before, when he had gathered a great multitude of foreign forces, and horses out of Asia not a few, came as though he would take Jewry by force of arms. 
\v 25 But when he drew near, they that were with Maccabeus turned themselves to pray unto God, and sprinkled earth upon \add their\add* heads, and girded \add their\add* loins with sackcloth, 
\v 26 and fell down at the foot of the altar, and besought \add him\add* to be merciful to them, and to be an enemy to their enemies, and an adversary to \add their\add* adversaries, as the law declareth. 
\v 27 So after the prayer they took \add their\add* weapons, and went on further from the city: and when they drew near to their enemies, they kept by themselves. 
\v 28 Now the sun being newly risen, they joined both together; the one part having together with \add their\add* virtue \add their\add* refuge \add also\add* unto the Lord \add for\add* a pledge of \add their\add* success and victory: the other side making \add their\add* rage leader of \add their\add* battle. 
\v 29 But when the battle waxed strong, there appeared unto the enemies from heaven five comely men upon horses with bridles of gold, and two \add of them\add* led the Jews, 
\v 30 and took Maccabeus betwixt them, and covered \add him\add* on every side with their weapons, and kept \add him\add* safe, but shot arrows and lightnings against the enemies: so that being confounded with blindness, and full of trouble, they were killed. 
\v 31 And there were slain \add of footmen\add* twenty thousand and five hundred, and six hundred horsemen. 
\p
\v 32 As for Timotheus himself, he fled into a very strong hold, called Gazara, where Chereas was governor. 
\v 33 But they that were with Maccabeus laid siege against the fortress courageously four days. 
\v 34 And they that were within, trusting to the strength of the place, blasphemed exceedingly, and uttered wicked words. 
\v 35 Nevertheless upon the fifth day early twenty young men of Maccabeus’ company, inflamed with anger because of the blasphemies, assaulted the wall manly, and with a fierce courage killed \add all\add* that \add they\add* met withal. 
\v 36 Others likewise ascending after \add them\add*, whiles \add they\add* were busied with them that were within, burnt the towers, and kindling fires burnt the blasphemers alive; and others broke open the gates, and, having received in the rest of the army, took the city, 
\v 37 and killed Timotheus, that was hid in a certain pit, and Chereas his brother, with Apollophanes. 
\v 38 When this was done, they praised the Lord with psalms and thanksgiving, who had done \add so\add* great things for Israel, and given them the victory. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 Not long after this, Lysias the king’s protector and cousin, who also managed the affairs, took sore displeasure for the \add things\add* that were done. 
\v 2 And when he had gathered about fourscore thousand with all the horsemen, he came against the Jews, thinking to make the city a habitation of the Gentiles, 
\v 3 and to make a gain of the temple, as of the other chapels of the heathen, and to set the high priesthood to sale every year: 
\v 4 not at all considering the power of God, but puffed up with \add his\add* ten thousands of footmen, and \add his\add* thousands of horsemen, and \add his\add* fourscore elephants. 
\v 5 So he came to Judea, and drew near to Bethsura, which was a strong town, but distant from Jerusalem about five furlongs, and he laid sore siege unto it. 
\v 6 Now when they that were with Maccabeus heard that he besieged the holds, they and \add all\add* the people with lamentation and tears besought the Lord that \add he\add* would send a good angel to deliver Israel. 
\v 7 Then Maccabeus himself first \add of all\add* took weapons, exhorting the other that they would jeopard themselves together with him to help their brethren: so they went forth together with a willing mind. 
\v 8 And as \add they\add* were at Jerusalem, there appeared before them on horseback one in white clothing, shaking \add his\add* armour of gold. 
\v 9 Then they praised the merciful God all together, and took heart, insomuch that they were ready not only \add to fight\add* with men, but with most cruel beasts, and to pierce through walls of iron. 
\v 10  \add Thus\add* they marched forward in \add their\add* armour, having a helper from heaven: for the Lord was merciful unto them. 
\v 11 And giving a charge upon \add their\add* enemies like lions, they slew eleven thousand \add footmen\add*, and sixteen hundred horsemen, and put all \add the other\add* to flight. 
\v 12 Many of them also \add being\add* wounded escaped naked; and Lysias himself fled \add away\add* shamefully, and \add so\add* escaped. 
\v 13 Who, as he was a man of understanding, casting with himself what loss he had had, and considering that the Hebrews could not be overcome, because the Almighty God helped them, he sent unto \add them\add*, 
\v 14 and persuaded \add them\add* to agree to all reasonable \add conditions\add*, and \add promised\add* that \add he\add* would persuade the king that \add he\add* must needs be a friend unto them. 
\v 15 Then Maccabeus consented to all that Lysias desired, being careful of the \add common\add* good; and whatsoever Maccabeus wrote unto Lysias concerning the Jews, the king granted \add it\add*. 
\p
\v 16 For there were letters written unto the Jews from Lysias to this effect: Lysias unto the people of the Jews \add sendeth\add* greeting: 
\v 17 John and Absalon, who were sent from you, delivered \add me\add* the petition subscribed, and made request for the performance of the contents thereof. 
\v 18 Therefore what \add things\add* soever were meet to be reported to the king, I have declared \add them\add*, and he hath granted as much as might be. 
\v 19 If then you will keep yourselves loyal to the state, hereafter also will I endeavour to be a means of your good. 
\v 20 But of the particulars I have given order both to these, and the \add other\add* that \add came\add* from me, to commune with you. 
\v 21 Fare ye well. The hundred and eight and forty year, the four and twenty \add day\add* of \add the month\add* Dioscorinthius. 
\p
\v 22 Now the king’s letter contained these words: King Antiochus unto \add his\add* brother Lysias \add sendeth\add* greeting: 
\v 23 Since our father is translated unto the gods, our will is, that they that are in \add our\add* realm live quietly, that \add every one\add* may attend upon his own \add affairs\add*. 
\v 24 We understand \add also\add* that the Jews would not consent to \add our\add* father, for to be brought unto the custom of the Gentiles, but had rather keep their own manner of living: for the which cause they require \add of us\add*, that \add we\add* should suffer them to live after their own laws. 
\v 25 Wherefore our mind is, that this nation shall be in rest, and we have determined to restore them their temple, that \add they\add* may live according to the customs of their forefathers. 
\v 26 Thou shalt do well therefore to send unto them, and grant \add them\add* peace, that when they are certified of our mind, they may be of good comfort, and ever go cheerfully about their own \add affairs\add*. 
\p
\v 27 And the letter of the king unto the nation \add of the Jews\add* was after this manner: King Antiochus \add sendeth\add* greeting unto the council, and the rest of the Jews: 
\v 28 if ye fare well, we have our desire: we are also in good health. 
\v 29 Menelaus declared unto us, that your desire was to return home, and to follow your own \add business:\add* 
\v 30 wherefore they that will depart shall have safe conduct till the thirtieth \add day\add* of Xanthicus with security. 
\v 31  \add And\add* the Jews shall use their own \add kind of\add* meats and laws, as before; and none of them any \add manner of\add* ways shall be molested for \add things\add* ignorantly done. 
\v 32 I have sent also Menelaus, that he may comfort you. 
\v 33 Fare ye well. In the hundred forty and eighth year, \add and\add* the fifteenth \add day\add* of \add the month\add* Xanthicus. 
\p
\v 34 The Romans also sent unto them a letter containing these words: Quintus Memmius \add and\add* Titus Manlius, ambassadors of the Romans, \add send\add* greeting unto the people of the Jews. 
\v 35 Whatsoever Lysias the king’s cousin hath granted, \add therewith\add* we also are well pleased. 
\v 36 But \add touching\add* such \add things\add* as he judged to be referred to the king, after you have advised thereof, send one forthwith, that we may declare as it is convenient for you: for we are \add now\add* going to Antioch. 
\v 37 Therefore send some with speed, that we may know what is your mind. 
\v 38 Farewell. \add This\add* hundred and eight and forty year, the fifteenth \add day\add* of \add the month\add* Xanthicus. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 When these covenants were made, Lysias went unto the king, and the Jews were about \add their\add* husbandry. 
\v 2 But of the governors of several places, Timotheus, and Apollonius the \add son\add* of Genneus, also Hieronymus, and Demophon, and besides them Nicanor the governor of Cyprus, would not suffer them to be quiet, and live in peace. 
\v 3 The men of Joppe also did such an ungodly deed: they prayed the Jews that dwelt among them to go with \add their\add* wives and children into the boats which they had prepared, as though \add they\add* had meant them no hurt. 
\v 4 Who accepted of \add it\add* according to the common decree of the city, as being desirous to live in peace, and suspecting nothing: but when they were gone forth into the deep, they drowned no less than two hundred \add of them\add*. 
\v 5 When Judas heard of \add this\add* cruelty done unto \add his\add* countrymen, he commanded those that were with him \add to make them ready\add*. 
\v 6 And calling upon God the righteous Judge, he came against \add those\add* murderers of \add his\add* brethren, and burnt the haven by night, and set the boats on fire, and those that fled thither he slew. 
\v 7 And when the town was shut up, he went backward, as if he would return to root out all them of the city of Joppe. 
\v 8 But when he heard that the Jamnites were minded to do in like manner unto the Jews that dwelt among \add them\add*, 
\v 9 he came upon the Jamnites also by night, and set fire on the haven and the navy, so that the light of the fire was seen at Jerusalem two hundred and forty furlongs off. 
\v 10 Now when \add they\add* were gone from thence nine furlongs in their journey toward Timotheus, no fewer than five thousand \add men on foot\add* and five hundred horsemen of the Arabians set upon him. 
\v 11 Whereupon there was a \add very\add* sore battle; but Judas’ side by the help of God got the victory; so that the Nomades of Arabia, being overcome, besought Judas for peace, promising both to give \add him\add* cattle, and to pleasure him otherwise. 
\v 12 Then Judas, thinking indeed that they \add would be\add* profitable in many \add things\add*, granted them peace: whereupon they shook hands, and \add so\add* they departed to their tents. 
\p
\v 13 He went also about to make a bridge to a certain strong city, which was fenced about with walls, and inhabited by people of divers countries; and the name \add of it was\add* Caspis. 
\v 14 But they that were within \add it\add* put \add such\add* trust in the strength of the walls and provision of victuals, \add that\add* they behaved themselves rudely toward them that were with Judas, railing and blaspheming, and uttering such \add words\add* as \add were\add* not to be spoken. 
\v 15 Wherefore Judas with his company, calling upon the great Lord of the world, who without \add any\add* rams or engines of war did cast down Jericho in the time of Joshua, gave a fierce assault against the walls, 
\v 16 and took the city by the will of God, and made unspeakable slaughters, insomuch that a lake two furlongs broad near adjoining \add thereunto\add*, being filled full, was seen running with blood. 
\v 17 Then departed they from thence seven hundred and fifty furlongs, and came to Characa unto the Jews that are called Tubieni. 
\v 18 But as for Timotheus, they found him not in the places: for before he had dispatched any thing, he departed from thence, having left a very strong garrison in a certain hold. 
\v 19 Howbeit Dositheus and Sosipater, \add who were\add* of Maccabeus’ captains, went forth, and slew those that Timotheus had left in the fortress, above ten thousand men. 
\p
\v 20 And Maccabeus ranged his army by bands, and set them over the bands, and went against Timotheus, who had about him an hundred and twenty thousand men of foot, and two thousand and five hundred horsemen. 
\v 21 Now when Timotheus had knowledge of Judas’ coming, he sent the women and children and the other baggage unto \add a fortress\add* called Carnion: for the town was hard to besiege, and uneasy to come unto, by reason of the straitness of all the places. 
\v 22 But when Judas his first band came in sight, the enemies, being smitten with fear and terror through the appearing of him that seeth all \add things\add*, fled amain, one running this way, another that way, so as that \add they\add* were often hurt of their own \add men\add*, and wounded with the points of \add their own\add* swords. 
\v 23 Judas also was very earnest in pursuing \add them\add*, killing \add those\add* wicked wretches, of whom he slew about thirty thousand men. 
\v 24 Moreover Timotheus himself fell into the hands of Dositheus and Sosipater, whom he besought with much craft to let him go with his life, because he had many of the \add Jews\add*’ parents, and the brethren of some \add of them\add*, who, if they put him to death, should not be regarded. 
\v 25 So when he had assured \add them\add* with many \add words\add* that \add he\add* would restore them without hurt, according to the agreement, they let him go for the saving of \add their\add* brethren. 
\p
\v 26 Then Maccabeus marched forth to Carnion, and to the temple of Atargatis, and \add there\add* he slew five and twenty thousand persons. 
\v 27 And after \add he\add* had put to flight and destroyed them, Judas removed the host towards Ephron, a strong city, wherein Lysias abode, and a great multitude of divers nations, and the strong young men kept the walls, and defended \add them\add* mightily: wherein \add also\add* was great provision of engines and darts. 
\v 28 But when \add Judas and his company\add* had called upon Almighty \add God\add*, who with \add his\add* power breaketh the strength of \add his\add* enemies, they wan the city, and slew twenty and five thousand of them that were within. 
\v 29 From thence they departed to Scythopolis, which lieth six hundred furlongs from Jerusalem. 
\v 30 But when the Jews that dwelt there had testified that the Scythopolitans dealt lovingly with them, and entreated \add them\add* kindly in the time of \add their\add* adversity; 
\v 31 they gave them thanks, desiring \add them\add* to be friendly still unto them: and \add so\add* they came to Jerusalem, the feast of the weeks approaching. 
\v 32 And after the \add feast\add*, called Pentecost, they went forth against Gorgias the governor of Idumea, 
\v 33 who came out with three thousand men of foot and four hundred horsemen. 
\v 34 And it happened that in \add their\add* fighting together a few of the Jews were slain. 
\v 35 At which time Dositheus, one of Bacenor’s \add company\add*, who was on horseback, and a strong man, was still upon Gorgias, and taking hold of \add his\add* coat drew him by force; and when \add he\add* would have taken that cursed \add man\add* alive, a horseman of Thracia coming upon him smote off \add his\add* shoulder, so that Gorgias fled unto Marisa. 
\v 36 Now when they that were with Gorgias had fought long, and were weary, Judas called upon the Lord, that \add he\add* would shew himself to be \add their\add* helper and leader of the battle. 
\v 37 And \add with that\add* he began in his own language, and sung psalms with a loud voice, and rushing unawares upon Gorgias’ men, he put them to flight. 
\v 38 So Judas gathered \add his\add* host, and came into the city of Odollam. And when the seventh day came, they purified themselves, as the custom was, and kept the sabbath in the same place. 
\p
\v 39 And upon the \add day\add* following, as the use had been, Judas and his company came to take up the bodies of them that were slain, and to bury \add them\add* with \add their\add* kinsmen in \add their\add* fathers’ graves. 
\v 40 Now under the coats of every one that was slain they found things consecrated to the idols of the Jamnites, which is forbidden the Jews by the law. Then every \add man\add* saw that this was the cause wherefore they were slain. 
\v 41 All \add men\add* therefore praising the Lord, the righteous Judge, who had opened the \add things\add* that were hid, 
\v 42 betook themselves unto prayer, and besought \add him\add* that the sin committed might wholly be put out of remembrance. Besides, \add that\add* noble Judas exhorted the people to keep themselves from sin, forsomuch as they saw before \add their\add* eyes the \add things\add* that came to pass for the sin of those that were slain. 
\v 43 And when he had made a gathering throughout the company to the sum of two thousand drachms of silver, he sent \add it\add* to Jerusalem to offer a sin offering, doing \add therein\add* very well and honestly, in that he was mindful of the resurrection: 
\v 44 for if he had not hoped that they that were slain should have risen again, it had been superfluous and vain to pray for the dead: 
\v 45 and also in that he perceived that there was great favour laid up for those that died godly, \add It was\add* a holy and good thought. Whereupon he made a reconciliation for the dead, that \add they\add* might be delivered from sin. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 In the hundred forty and ninth year it was told Judas, that Antiochus Eupator was coming with a great power into Judea, 
\v 2 and with him Lysias \add his\add* protector, and ruler of \add his\add* affairs, having either \add of them\add* a Grecian power, of footmen an hundred and ten thousand, and horsemen five thousand and three hundred, and elephants two and twenty, and three hundred chariots armed with hooks. 
\v 3 Menelaus also joined himself with them, and with great dissimulation encouraged Antiochus, not for the safeguard of the country, but because he thought to have been made governor. 
\v 4 But the King of kings moved Antiochus’ mind against \add this\add* wicked wretch, and Lysias informed \add the king\add* that this \add man\add* was the cause of all mischief, so that \add the king\add* commanded to bring him unto Berea, and to put \add him\add* to death, as the manner is in \add that\add* place. 
\v 5 Now there was in \add that\add* place a tower of fifty cubits \add high\add*, full of ashes, and it had a round instrument, which on every side hanged down into the ashes. 
\v 6  \add And\add* whosoever was condemned of sacrilege, or had committed any other grievous crime, there did all \add men\add* thrust \add him\add* unto death. 
\v 7 Such a death it happened \add that\add* wicked \add man\add* to die, not having so much as burial in the earth; \add and that\add* most justly: 
\v 8 for inasmuch as he had committed many sins about the altar, whose fire and ashes were holy, he received \add his\add* death in ashes. 
\p
\v 9 Now the king came with a barbarous and haughty mind to do far worse to the Jews, than had been done in his father’s time. 
\v 10 Which \add things\add* when Judas perceived, he commanded the multitude to call upon the Lord night and day, that if ever at any other time, \add he\add* would now also help them, being at the point to be put from \add their\add* law, from \add their\add* country, and from the holy temple: 
\v 11 and that \add he\add* would not suffer the people, that had \add even\add* now been but a little refreshed, to be in subjection to the blasphemous nations. 
\v 12 So when they had all done this together, and besought the merciful Lord with weeping and fasting, and lying flat upon the ground three days long, Judas, having exhorted them, commanded \add they\add* should be in a readiness. 
\v 13 And \add Judas\add*, being apart with the elders, determined, before the king’s host should enter into Judea, and get the city, to go forth and try the matter \add in fight\add* by the help of the Lord. 
\v 14 So when he had committed all to the Creator of the world, and exhorted his soldiers to fight manfully, \add even\add* unto death, for the laws, the temple, the city, the country, \add and\add* the commonwealth, he camped by Modin: 
\v 15 and having given the watchword to them that were about him, Victory \add is\add* of God; with the most valiant \add and\add* choice young men he went in into the king’s tent by night, and slew in the camp about four thousand men, and the chiefest of the elephants, with all that were upon him. 
\v 16 And at last they filled the camp with fear and tumult, and departed with good success. 
\v 17 This was done in the break of the day, because the protection of the Lord did help him. 
\p
\v 18 Now when the king had taken a taste of the manliness of the Jews, he went about to take the holds by policy, 
\v 19 and marched towards Bethsura, \add which was\add* a strong hold of the Jews: but he was put to flight, failed, and lost \add of his men:\add* 
\v 20 for Judas had conveyed unto them that were in \add it\add* such \add things\add* as were necessary. 
\v 21 But Rhodocus, \add who was\add* in the Jews’ host, disclosed the secrets to the enemies; therefore he was sought out, and when they had gotten him, they put him in prison. 
\v 22 The king treated with them in Bethsura the second time, gave his hand, took \add theirs\add*, departed, fought with Judas, was overcome; 
\v 23 heard that Philip, who was left over the affairs in Antioch, was desperately bent, [was] confounded, intreated the Jews, submitted himself, and sware to all equal conditions, agreed with \add them\add*, and offered sacrifice, honoured the temple, and dealt kindly with the place, 
\v 24 and accepted well of Maccabeus, made \add him\add* principal governor from Ptolemais unto the Gerrhenians; 
\v 25 came to Ptolemais: the people there were grieved for the covenants; for they stormed, because they would make \add their\add* covenants void: 
\v 26 Lysias went up to the judgment seat, said as much as could be in defence \add of the cause\add*, persuaded, pacified, made \add them\add* well affected, returned to Antioch. Thus it went \add touching\add* the king’s coming and departing. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1 After three years was Judas informed, that Demetrius the \add son\add* of Seleucus, having entered by the haven of Tripolis with a great power and navy, 
\v 2 had taken the country, and killed Antiochus, and Lysias his protector. 
\v 3 Now one Alcimus, who had been high priest, and had defiled himself wilfully in the times of \add their\add* mingling \add with the Gentiles\add*, seeing that by no means he could save himself, nor have any more access to the holy altar, 
\v 4 came to king Demetrius in the hundred and one and fiftieth year, presenting unto him a crown of gold, and a palm, and also of the boughs which were used solemnly in the temple: and \add so\add* that day he held his peace. 
\v 5 Howbeit, having gotten opportunity to further \add his\add* foolish enterprise, \add and\add* being called into counsel by Demetrius, and asked how the Jews stood affected, and what they intended, he answered thereunto: 
\v 6 Those of the Jews that be called Asideans, whose captain is Judas Maccabeus, nourish war, and are seditious, and will not let the realm be in peace. 
\v 7 Therefore I, being deprived of mine ancestors’ honour, I mean the high priesthood, am now come hither: 
\v 8 first verily, for the unfeigned care I have of \add things\add* pertaining to the king; and secondly, even for that I intend the good of mine own countrymen: for all our nation is in no small misery through the unadvised dealing of \add them\add* aforesaid. 
\v 9 Wherefore, O king, seeing thou knowest all these \add things\add*, be careful for the country, and our nation, which is pressed on every side, according to the clemency that thou readily shewest unto all. 
\v 10 For as long as Judas liveth, \add it is\add* not possible that the state should be quiet. 
\p
\v 11 This was no sooner spoken of him, but others of the \add king’s\add* friends, being maliciously set against Judas, did more incense Demetrius. 
\v 12 And forthwith calling Nicanor, who had been master of the elephants, and making \add him\add* governor over Judea, he sent \add him\add* forth, 
\v 13 commanding \add him\add* to slay Judas, and to scatter them that were with him, and to make Alcimus high priest of the great temple. 
\v 14 Then the heathen, that had fled out of Judea from Judas, came to Nicanor by flocks, thinking the harm and calamities of the Jews to be their welfare. 
\v 15 Now when \add the Jews\add* heard of Nicanor’s coming, and that the heathen were up against \add them\add*, they cast earth upon their \add heads\add*, and made supplication to him that had stablished his people for ever, and who always helpeth his portion with manifestation \add of his presence\add*. 
\v 16 So at the commandment of the captain they removed straightways from thence, and came near unto them at the town of Dessau. 
\p
\v 17 Now Simon, Judas’ brother, had joined battle with Nicanor, but \add was\add* somewhat discomfited through the sudden silence of \add his\add* enemies. 
\v 18 Nevertheless Nicanor, hearing of the manliness of them that were with Judas, and the courageousness that they had to fight for \add their\add* country, durst not try the matter by the sword. 
\v 19 Wherefore he sent Posidonius, and Theodotus, and Mattathias, to make peace. 
\v 20 So when \add they\add* had taken long advisement thereupon, and the captain had made the multitude acquainted \add therewith\add*, and it appeared that they were all of one mind, they consented to the covenants, 
\v 21 and appointed a day to meet in together by themselves: and \add when the day\add* came, and stools were set for either of them, 
\v 22 Judas placed armed \add men\add* ready in convenient places, lest \add some\add* treachery should be suddenly practised by the enemies: \add so\add* they made a peaceable conference. 
\p
\v 23 Now Nicanor abode in Jerusalem, and did no hurt, but sent away the people that came flocking \add unto him\add*. 
\v 24 And he would not willingly have Judas out of \add his\add* sight: \add for\add* he loved the man from his heart. 
\v 25 He prayed him also to take a wife, and to beget children: \add so\add* he married, was quiet, \add and\add* took part of \add this\add* life. 
\v 26 But Alcimus, perceiving the love that was betwixt them, and considering the covenants that were made, came to Demetrius, and told \add him\add* that Nicanor was not well affected toward the state; for that he had ordained Judas, a traitor to his realm, \add to be the king’s\add* successor. 
\v 27 Then the king being in a rage, and provoked with the accusations of the most wicked \add man\add*, wrote to Nicanor, signifying that \add he\add* was much displeased with the covenants, and commanding \add him\add* that \add he\add* should send Maccabeus prisoner in \add all\add* haste unto Antioch. 
\v 28 When this came to Nicanor’s hearing, he was \add much\add* confounded \add in himself\add*, and took it grievously that he should make void the \add articles\add* which were agreed upon, the man being in no fault. 
\v 29 But because there was no dealing against the king, he watched his time to accomplish this \add thing\add* by policy. 
\v 30 Notwithstanding, when Maccabeus saw that Nicanor began to be churlish unto him, and that he entreated \add him\add* more roughly than he was wont, perceiving that \add such\add* sour behaviour came not of good, he gathered together not a few of his men, and withdrew himself from Nicanor. 
\v 31 But the other, knowing that he was notably prevented by \add Judas\add*’ policy, came into the great and holy temple, and commanded the priests, that were offering \add their\add* usual sacrifices, to deliver \add him\add* the man. 
\v 32 And when they sware that \add they\add* could not tell where the \add man\add* was whom he sought, 
\v 33 he stretched out \add his\add* right hand toward the temple, and made an oath in this manner: If you will not deliver me Judas \add as\add* a prisoner, I will lay this temple of God even with the ground, and I will break down the altar, and erect a notable temple unto Bacchus. 
\v 34 After these \add words\add* he departed. Then the priests lift up \add their\add* hands towards heaven, and besought him that was ever a defender of their nation, saying in this manner; 
\v 35 Thou, O Lord of all \add things\add*, who hast need of nothing, wast pleased that the temple of thine habitation should be among us: 
\v 36 therefore now, O holy Lord of all holiness, keep this house ever undefiled, which lately was cleansed, and stop every unrighteous mouth. 
\p
\v 37 Now was there accused unto Nicanor one Razis, \add one\add* of the elders of Jerusalem, a lover of \add his\add* countrymen, and a man of very good report, who for \add his\add* kindness was called a father of the Jews. 
\v 38 For in the former times, when \add they\add* mingled not \add themselves with the Gentiles\add*, he had been accused of Judaism, and did boldly jeopard \add his\add* body and life with all vehemency for the religion of the Jews. 
\v 39 So Nicanor, willing to declare the hate that he bare unto the Jews, sent above five hundred men of war to take him: 
\v 40 for he thought by taking him to do \add the Jews much\add* hurt. 
\v 41 Now when the multitude would have taken the tower, and violently broken into the utter door, and bade that fire should be brought to burn it, he being ready to be taken on every side fell upon \add his\add* sword; 
\v 42 choosing \add rather\add* to die manfully, than to come into the hands of the wicked, to be abused otherwise than beseemed his noble birth: 
\v 43 but missing \add his\add* stroke through haste, the multitude also rushing within the doors, he ran boldly up to the wall, and cast himself down manfully among the thickest \add of them\add*. 
\v 44 But they quickly giving back, and a space being made, he fell \add down\add* into the midst of the void place. 
\v 45 Nevertheless, while there was yet breath within him, being inflamed with anger, he rose up; \add and\add* though \add his\add* blood gushed out like spouts of water, and \add his\add* wounds were grievous, \add yet\add* he ran through the midst of the throng; and standing upon a steep rock, 
\v 46 when as his blood was now quite gone, he pluckt out \add his\add* bowels, and taking \add them\add* in both \add his\add* hands, he cast \add them\add* upon the throng, and calling upon the Lord of life and spirit to restore him those again, he thus died. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1 But Nicanor, hearing that Judas and his company were in the \add strong\add* places about Samaria, resolved without any danger to set upon them on the sabbath day. 
\v 2 Nevertheless the Jews that were compelled to go with him said, O destroy not so cruelly and barbarously, but give honour to \add that\add* day, which he, that seeth all \add things\add*, hath honoured with holiness above \add other days\add*. 
\v 3 Then the most ungracious \add wretch\add* demanded, if there were a Mighty One in heaven, that had commanded the sabbath day to be kept. 
\v 4 And when they said, There is in heaven a living Lord, \add and\add* mighty, who commanded the seventh day to be kept: 
\v 5 then said the other, And I \add also am\add* mighty upon earth, and I command to take arms, and to do the king’s business. Yet he obtained not to have his wicked will done. 
\v 6 So Nicanor in exceeding pride and haughtiness determined to set up a publick monument of \add his\add* victory over Judas and them that were with him. 
\p
\v 7 But Maccabeus had ever sure confidence that the Lord would help him: 
\v 8 wherefore he exhorted his people not to fear the coming of the heathen against \add them\add*, but to remember the help which in former times they had received from heaven, and now to expect the victory and aid, which should come unto them from the Almighty. 
\v 9 And \add so\add* comforting them out of the law and the prophets, and withal putting them in mind of the battles that they won \add afore\add*, he made them more cheerful. 
\v 10 And when he had stirred up their minds, he gave \add them their\add* charge, shewing \add them\add* therewithal the falsehood of the heathen, and the breach of oaths. 
\v 11 Thus he armed every one of them, not \add so much with\add* defence of shields and spears, as \add with\add* comfortable and good words: and besides \add that\add*, he told \add them\add* a dream worthy to be believed, as if it had been so indeed, which did \add not a little\add* rejoice them. 
\v 12 And this was his vision: That Onias, who had been high priest, a virtuous and a good man, reverend \add in\add* conversation, gentle \add in\add* condition, well spoken also, and exercised from a child \add in\add* all points of virtue, holding up \add his\add* hands prayed for the whole body of the Jews. 
\v 13 This done, in like manner there appeared a man with gray hairs, and exceeding glorious, who was of a wonderful and excellent majesty. 
\v 14 Then Onias answered, saying, This is a lover of the brethren, who prayeth much for the people, and \add for\add* the holy city, \add to wit\add*, Jeremias the prophet of God. 
\v 15 Whereupon Jeremias holding forth \add his\add* right hand gave to Judas a sword of gold, and in giving \add it\add* spake thus, 
\v 16 Take \add this\add* holy sword, a gift from God, with the which thou shalt wound the adversaries. 
\p
\v 17 Thus being \add well\add* comforted by the words of Judas, \add which were\add* very good, and able to stir \add them\add* up to valour, and to encourage the hearts of the young \add men\add*, they determined not to pitch camp, but courageously to set upon \add them\add*, and manfully to try the matter by conflict, because the city and the sanctuary and the temple were in danger. 
\v 18 For the care that they took for \add their\add* wives, and \add their\add* children, \add their\add* brethren, and kinsfolks, was in least account with them: but the greatest and principal fear \add was\add* for the holy temple. 
\v 19 Also they that were in the city took not the least care, being troubled for the conflict abroad. 
\v 20 And now, when as all looked what should be the trial, and the enemies were already come near, and the army was set in array, and the beasts conveniently placed, and the horsemen set in wings, 
\v 21 Maccabeus seeing the coming of the multitude, and the divers preparations of armour, and the fierceness of the beasts, stretched out \add his\add* hands toward heaven, and called upon the Lord that worketh wonders, knowing that victory cometh not by arms, but even as it seemeth good to him, he giveth it to \add such as are\add* worthy: 
\v 22 therefore in his prayer he said \add after\add* this manner; O Lord, thou didst send thine angel in the time of Ezekias king of Judea, and didst slay in the host of Sennacherib an hundred fourscore and five thousand: 
\v 23  \add wherefore\add* now also, O Lord of heaven, send a good angel before us for a fear and dread unto them; 
\v 24  \add and\add* through the might of thine arm let those be stricken with terror, that come against thy holy people to blaspheme. And he ended thus. 
\p
\v 25 Then Nicanor and they that were with him came forward with trumpets and songs. 
\v 26 But Judas and his company encountered the enemies with invocation and prayer. 
\v 27 So that fighting with \add their\add* hands, and praying unto God with \add their\add* hearts, they slew no less than thirty and five thousand \add men:\add* for through the appearance of God they were greatly cheered. 
\v 28 Now when the battle was done, returning \add again\add* with joy, they knew that Nicanor lay dead in \add his\add* harness. 
\v 29 Then \add they\add* made a great shout and a noise, praising the Almighty in their own language. 
\v 30 And \add Judas\add*, who was ever the chief defender of the citizens \add both\add* in body and mind, \add and\add* who continued \add his\add* love toward \add his\add* countrymen all \add his\add* life, commanded to strike off Nicanor’s head, and \add his\add* hand with \add his\add* shoulder, and bring \add them\add* to Jerusalem. 
\v 31 So when he was there, and had called them of \add his\add* nation together, and set the priests before the altar, he sent for them that were of the tower, 
\v 32 and shewed \add them\add* vile Nicanor’s head, and the hand of \add that\add* blasphemer, which with proud brags he had stretched out against the holy temple of the Almighty. 
\v 33 And when he had cut out the tongue of \add that\add* ungodly Nicanor, he commanded that \add they\add* should give \add it\add* by pieces unto the fowls, and hang up the reward of \add his\add* madness before the temple. 
\v 34 So every man praised toward the heaven the glorious Lord, saying, Blessed \add be\add* he that hath kept his own place undefiled. 
\v 35 He hanged also Nicanor’s head upon the tower, an evident and manifest sign unto all of the help of the Lord. 
\v 36 And they ordained all with a common decree in no case to let that day pass without solemnity, but to celebrate the thirteenth \add day\add* of the twelfth month, \add which\add* in the Syrian tongue is called Adar, the day before Mardocheus’ day. 
\v 37 Thus went it with Nicanor: and from that time forth the Hebrews had the city in their power. And here will I make an end. 
\p
\v 38 And if \add I have done\add* well, and as is fitting the story, \add it is\add* that \add which\add* I desired: but if slenderly and meanly, \add it is\add* that \add which\add* I could attain unto. 
\v 39 For as \add it is\add* hurtful to drink wine or water alone; and as wine mingled with water \add is\add* pleasant, and delighteth the taste: even so speech finely framed delighteth the ears of them that read the story. And here shall be an end.
