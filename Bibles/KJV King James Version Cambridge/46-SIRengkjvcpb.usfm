\mt2 THE WISDOM OF JESUS THE SON OF SIRCH, 
\mt3 OR, 
\mt1 ECCLESIASTICUS. 
\is1 A Prologue made by an uncertain Author. 
\im \sc This\sc* Jesus was the son of Sirach, and grandchild to Jesus of the same name with him. This \add man\add* therefore lived in the latter times, after \add the people\add* had been led away captive, and called home again, and almost after all the prophets. Now his grandfather Jesus, as he himself witnesseth, was a man of great diligence and wisdom among the Hebrews, who did not only gather the grave and short sentences of wise men, that had been before him, but himself also uttered some of his own, full of much understanding and wisdom. When as therefore the first Jesus died, leaving this book almost perfected, Sirach \add his son\add* receiving \add it\add* after him left \add it\add* to his own son Jesus; who, having gotten it into his hands, compiled \add it\add* all orderly into one volume, \add and called it\add* Wisdom, intituling \add it\add* both by his own name, his father’s \add name,\add* and his grandfather’s; alluring the hearer by the very name of wisdom to have a greater love to the study of this book. It containeth therefore wise sayings, dark sentences, and parables, and certain particular ancient godly stories of men that pleased God; also his prayer and song; moreover, what benefits God had vouchsafed his people, and what plagues he had heaped upon their enemies. This Jesus did imitate Solomon, and was no less famous for wisdom and learning, both being indeed a man of great learning, and \add so\add* reputed \add also\add*. 
\is1 The Prologue of the Wisdom of Jesus, the Son of Sirach. 
\im \sc Whereas\sc* many and great \add things\add* have been delivered unto us by the law and the prophets, and \add by\add* others that have followed their steps, for the which \add things\add* Israel ought to be commended for learning and wisdom; and whereof not only the readers must needs become skilful themselves, but also they that desire to learn be able to profit them which are without, both by speaking and writing: my grandfather Jesus, when he had much given himself to the reading of the law, and the prophets, and other books of \add our\add* fathers, and had gotten therein good judgment, was drawn on also himself to write something pertaining to learning and wisdom; to the intent that those which are desirous to learn, and are addicted to these \add things\add*, might profit much more in living according to the law. Wherefore let \add me\add* intreat you to read it with favour and attention, and to pardon \add us\add*, wherein we may seem to come short of some words, which \add we\add* have laboured to interpret. For the same \add things\add* uttered in Hebrew, and translated into another tongue, have not the same force \add in them;\add* and not only these \add things\add*, but the law itself, and the prophets, and the rest of the books, have no small difference, when they are spoken in their own language. For in the eight and thirtieth year coming into Egypt, when Euergetes was king, and continuing there some time, I found a book of no small learning: therefore I thought it most necessary for me to bestow some diligence and travail to interpret it; using great watchfulness and skill in \add that\add* space to bring the book to an end, and set it forth for them also, which in a strange country are willing to learn, being prepared before \add in\add* manners to live after the law. 
\c 1  
\q1
\v 1 All wisdom \add cometh\add* from the Lord, 
\q1 And is with him for ever. 
\q1
\v 2 Who can number the sand of the sea, and the drops of rain, 
\q1 And the days of eternity? 
\q1
\v 3 Who can find out the height of heaven, and the breadth of the earth, 
\q1 And the deep, and wisdom? 
\q1
\v 4 Wisdom hath been created before all \add things\add*, 
\q1 And the understanding of prudence from everlasting. 
\q1
\v 5 The word of God most high \add is\add* the fountain of wisdom; 
\q1 And her ways \add are\add* everlasting commandments. 
\q1
\v 6 To whom hath the root of wisdom been revealed? 
\q1 Or who hath known her wise counsels? 
\q1
\v 7  \add Unto whom hath the knowledge of wisdom been made manifest?\add* 
\q1 \add And who hath understood her great experience?\add* 
\q1
\v 8 There is one wise \add and\add* greatly to be feared, 
\q1 The Lord sitting upon his throne. 
\q1
\v 9 He created her, and saw \add her\add*, and numbered her, 
\q1 And poured her out upon all his works. 
\q1
\v 10  \add She is\add* with all flesh according to his gift, 
\q1 And he hath given her to them that love him. 
\q1
\v 11 The fear of the Lord \add is\add* honour, and glory, 
\q1 And gladness, and a crown of rejoicing. 
\q1
\v 12 The fear of the Lord maketh a merry heart, 
\q1 And giveth joy, and gladness, and a long life. 
\q1
\v 13 Whoso feareth the Lord, it shall go well with him at the last, 
\q1 And he shall find favour in the day of his death. 
\q1
\v 14 To fear the Lord \add is\add* the beginning of wisdom: 
\q1 And it was created with the faithful in the womb. 
\q1
\v 15 She hath built an everlasting foundation with men, 
\q1 And she shall continue with their seed. 
\q1
\v 16 To fear the Lord \add is\add* fulness of wisdom, 
\q1 And filleth men with her fruits. 
\q1
\v 17 She filleth all their house with things desirable, 
\q1 And the garners with her increase. 
\q1
\v 18 The fear of the Lord \add is\add* a crown of wisdom, 
\q1 Making peace and perfect health to flourish; 
\q1 Both which are the gifts of God: 
\q1 And it enlargeth their rejoicing that love him. 
\q1
\v 19 Wisdom raineth down skill and knowledge of understanding, 
\q1 And exalteth them to honour that hold her fast. 
\q1
\v 20 The root of wisdom \add is\add* to fear the Lord, 
\q1 And the branches thereof \add are\add* long life. 
\q1
\v 21 The fear of the Lord driveth away sins: 
\q1 And where it is present, it turneth away wrath. 
\q1
\v 22 A furious man cannot be justified; 
\q1 For the sway of his fury \add shall be\add* his destruction. 
\q1
\v 23 A patient \add man\add* will bear for a time, 
\q1 And afterward joy shall spring up unto him. 
\q1
\v 24 He will hide his words for a time, 
\q1 And the lips of many shall declare his wisdom. 
\q1
\v 25 The parables of knowledge \add are\add* in the treasures of wisdom: 
\q1 But godliness \add is\add* an abomination to a sinner. 
\q1
\v 26 If thou desire wisdom, keep the commandments, 
\q1 And the Lord shall give her unto thee. 
\q1
\v 27 For the fear of the Lord \add is\add* wisdom and instruction: 
\q1 And faith and meekness \add are\add* his delight. 
\q1
\v 28 Distrust not the fear of the Lord when thou art poor: 
\q1 And come not unto him with a double heart. 
\q1
\v 29 Be not a hypocrite in the sight of men, 
\q1 And take good heed what thou speakest. 
\q1
\v 30 Exalt not thyself, lest thou fall, 
\q1 And bring dishonour upon thy soul, 
\q1 And \add so\add* God discover thy secrets, 
\q1 And cast thee down in the midst of the congregation, 
\q1 Because thou camest not in truth to the fear of the Lord, 
\q1 But thy heart \add is\add* full of deceit. 
\c 2  
\q1
\v 1  \add My\add* son, if thou come to serve the Lord, 
\q1 Prepare thy soul for temptation. 
\q1
\v 2 Set thy heart aright, and constantly endure, 
\q1 And make not haste in time of trouble. 
\q1
\v 3 Cleave unto him, and depart not away, 
\q1 That thou mayest be increased at thy last end. 
\q1
\v 4 Whatsoever is brought upon thee take cheerfully, 
\q1 And be patient when thou art changed to a low estate. 
\q1
\v 5 For gold is tried in the fire, 
\q1 And acceptable men in the furnace of adversity. 
\q1
\v 6 Believe in him, and he will help thee; 
\q1 Order thy way aright, and trust in him. 
\q1
\v 7  \add Ye\add* that fear the Lord, wait for his mercy; 
\q1 And go not aside, lest ye fall. 
\q1
\v 8  \add Ye\add* that fear the Lord, believe him; 
\q1 And your reward shall not fail. 
\q1
\v 9  \add Ye\add* that fear the Lord, hope for good, 
\q1 And for everlasting joy and mercy. 
\q1
\v 10 Look at the generations of old, and see; 
\q1 Did \add ever\add* any trust in the Lord, and was confounded? 
\q1 Or did any abide in his fear, and was forsaken? 
\q1 Or whom did he \add ever\add* despise, that called upon him? 
\q1
\v 11 For the Lord \add is\add* full of compassion and mercy, 
\q1 Longsuffering, and very pitiful, and forgiveth sins, 
\q1 And saveth in time of affliction. 
\q1
\v 12 Woe \add be\add* to fearful hearts, and faint hands, 
\q1 And the sinner that goeth two ways! 
\q1
\v 13 Woe unto him that is fainthearted! for he believeth not; 
\q1 Therefore shall he not be defended. 
\q1
\v 14 Woe unto you that have lost patience! 
\q1 And what will ye do when the Lord shall visit \add you?\add* 
\q1
\v 15 They that fear the Lord will not disobey his word; 
\q1 And they that love him will keep his ways. 
\q1
\v 16 They that fear the Lord will seek that which is wellpleasing unto him; 
\q1 And they that love him shall be filled with the law. 
\q1
\v 17 They that fear the Lord will prepare their hearts, 
\q1 And humble their souls in his sight, 
\q1
\v 18  \add Saying\add*, We will fall into the hands of the Lord, and not into the hands of men: 
\q1 For as his majesty \add is\add*, so \add is\add* his mercy. 
\c 3  
\q1
\v 1 Hear me \add your\add* father, O children, 
\q1 And do thereafter, that ye may be safe. 
\q1
\v 2 For the Lord hath given the father honour over the children, 
\q1 And hath confirmed the authority of the mother over the sons. 
\q1
\v 3 Whoso honoureth \add his\add* father maketh an atonement for \add his\add* sins: 
\q1
\v 4 And he that honoureth his mother \add is\add* as one that layeth up treasure. 
\q1
\v 5 Whoso honoureth \add his\add* father shall have joy of \add his own\add* children; 
\q1 And when he maketh his prayer, he shall be heard. 
\q1
\v 6 He that honoureth \add his\add* father shall have a long life; 
\q1 And he that is obedient unto the Lord shall be a comfort to his mother. 
\q1
\v 7 He that feareth the Lord will honour \add his\add* father, 
\q1 And will do service unto his parents, as to \add his\add* masters. 
\q1
\v 8 Honour thy father and mother \add both\add* in word and deed, 
\q1 That a blessing may come upon thee from them. 
\q1
\v 9 For the blessing of the father establisheth the houses of children; 
\q1 But the curse of the mother rooteth out foundations. 
\q1
\v 10 Glory not in the dishonour of thy father; 
\q1 For \add thy\add* father’s dishonour is no glory unto thee. 
\q1
\v 11 For the glory of a man \add is\add* from the honour of his father; 
\q1 And a mother in dishonour \add is\add* a reproach to the children. 
\q1
\v 12 My son, help thy father in \add his\add* age, 
\q1 And grieve him not as long as he liveth. 
\q1
\v 13 And if his understanding fail, have patience \add with him;\add* 
\q1 And despise him not when thou art in thy full strength. 
\q1
\v 14 For the relieving of thy father shall not be forgotten: 
\q1 And instead of sins it shall be added to build thee up. 
\q1
\v 15 In the day of thine affliction it shall be remembered; 
\q1 Thy sins also shall melt away, as the ice in the fair warm weather. 
\q1
\v 16 He that forsaketh his father \add is\add* as a blasphemer; 
\q1 And he that angereth his mother \add is\add* cursed of God. 
\q1
\v 17  \add My\add* son, go on with thy business in meekness; 
\q1 So shalt thou be beloved of him that is approved. 
\q1
\v 18 The great\add er\add* thou art, the more humble thyself, 
\q1 And thou shalt find favour before the Lord. 
\q1
\v 19 Many are in high place, and of renown: 
\q1 But mysteries are revealed unto the meek. 
\q1
\v 20 For the power of the Lord \add is\add* great, 
\q1 And he is honoured of the lowly. 
\q1
\v 21 Seek not out \add things that are\add* too hard for thee, 
\q1 Neither search the \add things that are\add* above thy strength. 
\q1
\v 22  \add But\add* what is commanded thee, think thereupon with reverence; 
\q1 For it is not needful for thee to see with thine eyes the \add things that are\add* in secret. 
\q1
\v 23 Be not curious in unnecessary matters: 
\q1 For more \add things\add* are shewed unto thee than men understand. 
\q1
\v 24 For many are deceived by their own vain opinion; 
\q1 And an evil suspicion hath overthrown their judgment. 
\q1
\v 25 Without eyes thou shalt want light: 
\q1 Profess not the knowledge therefore that thou hast not. 
\q1
\v 26 A stubborn heart shall fare evil at the last; 
\q1 And he that loveth danger shall perish therein. 
\q1
\v 27 An obstinate heart shall be laden with sorrows; 
\q1 And the wicked \add man\add* shall heap sin upon sin. 
\q1
\v 28 In the punishment of the proud there is no remedy; 
\q1 For the plant of wickedness hath taken root in him. 
\q1
\v 29 The heart of the prudent will understand a parable; 
\q1 And an attentive ear \add is\add* the desire of a wise \add man\add*. 
\q1
\v 30 Water will quench a flaming fire; 
\q1 And alms maketh an atonement for sins. 
\q1
\v 31 And he that requiteth good turns is mindful of that which \add may\add* come hereafter; 
\q1 And when \add he\add* falleth, he shall find a stay. 
\c 4  
\q1
\v 1  \add My\add* son, defraud not the poor of his living, 
\q1 And make not the needy eyes to wait long. 
\q1
\v 2 Make not a hungry soul sorrowful; 
\q1 Neither provoke a man in his distress. 
\q1
\v 3 Add not more trouble to a heart that is vexed; 
\q1 And defer not to give to him that is in need. 
\q1
\v 4 Reject not the supplication of the afflicted; 
\q1 Neither turn away thy face from a poor \add man\add*. 
\q1
\v 5 Turn not away \add thine\add* eye from the needy, 
\q1 And give him none occasion to curse thee: 
\q1
\v 6 For if \add he\add* curse thee in the bitterness of his soul, 
\q1 His prayer shall be heard of him that made him. 
\q1
\v 7 Get thyself the love of the congregation, 
\q1 And bow thy head to a great man. 
\q1
\v 8 Let it not grieve thee to bow down thine ear to the poor, 
\q1 And give him a friendly answer with meekness. 
\q1
\v 9 Deliver him that suffereth wrong from the hand of the oppressor; 
\q1 And be not fainthearted when thou sittest in judgment. 
\q1
\v 10 Be as a father unto the fatherless, 
\q1 And instead of a husband unto their mother: 
\q1 So shalt thou be as the son of the most High, 
\q1 And he shall love thee more than thy mother \add doth\add*. 
\q1
\v 11 Wisdom exalteth her children, 
\q1 And layeth hold of them that seek her. 
\q1
\v 12 He that loveth her loveth life; 
\q1 And they that seek to her early shall be filled with joy. 
\q1
\v 13 He that holdeth her fast shall inherit glory; 
\q1 And where\add soever\add* she entereth, the Lord will bless. 
\q1
\v 14 They that serve her shall minister to the Holy One: 
\q1 And them that love her the Lord doth love. 
\q1
\v 15 Whoso giveth ear unto her shall judge the nations: 
\q1 And he that attendeth unto her shall dwell securely. 
\q1
\v 16 If \add a man\add* commit himself \add unto her\add*, he shall inherit her; 
\q1 And his generations shall hold \add her\add* in possession. 
\q1
\v 17 For at the first she will walk with him by crooked ways, 
\q1 And bring fear and dread upon him, 
\q1 And torment him with her discipline, 
\q1 Until she may trust his soul, 
\q1 And try him by her laws. 
\q1
\v 18 Then will she return the straight \add way\add* unto him, 
\q1 And comfort him, and shew him her secrets. 
\q1
\v 19  \add But\add* if he go wrong, she will forsake him, 
\q1 And give him over to his own ruin. 
\q1
\v 20 Observe the opportunity, and beware of evil; 
\q1 And be not ashamed when it concerneth thy soul. 
\q1
\v 21 For there is a shame that bringeth sin; 
\q1 And there is a shame \add which is\add* glory and grace. 
\q1
\v 22 Accept no person against thy soul, 
\q1 And let not the reverence \add of any man\add* cause thee to fall. 
\q1
\v 23 And refrain not to speak, when there is occasion to do good, 
\q1 And hide not thy wisdom in \add her\add* beauty. 
\q1
\v 24 For by speech wisdom shall be known: 
\q1 And learning by the word of the tongue. 
\q1
\v 25 In no wise speak against the truth; 
\q1 But be abashed of the error of thine ignorance. 
\q1
\v 26 Be not ashamed to confess thy sins; 
\q1 And force not the course of the river. 
\q1
\v 27 Make not thyself an underling to a foolish man; 
\q1 Neither accept the person of the mighty. 
\q1
\v 28 Strive for the truth unto death, 
\q1 And the Lord shall fight for thee. 
\q1
\v 29 Be not hasty in thy tongue, 
\q1 And in thy deeds slack and remiss. 
\q1
\v 30 Be not as a lion in thy house, 
\q1 Nor frantick among thy servants. 
\q1
\v 31 Let not thine hand be stretched out to receive, 
\q1 And shut when \add thou\add* shouldest repay. 
\c 5  
\q1
\v 1 Set not thy heart upon thy goods: 
\q1 And say not, I have enough for my life. 
\q1
\v 2 Follow not thine own mind and thy strength, 
\q1 To walk in the ways of thy heart: 
\q1
\v 3 And say not, Who shall controul me for my works? 
\q1 For the Lord will surely revenge thy pride. 
\q1
\v 4 Say not, I have sinned, and what harm hath happened unto me? 
\q1 For the Lord is longsuffering, he will in no wise let thee go. 
\q1
\v 5 Concerning propitiation, be not without fear 
\q1 To add sin unto sin: 
\q1
\v 6 And say not, His mercy \add is\add* great; 
\q1 He will be pacified for the multitude of my sins: 
\q1 For mercy and wrath come from him, 
\q1 And his indignation resteth upon sinners. 
\q1
\v 7 Make no tarrying to turn to the Lord, 
\q1 And put not off from day to day: 
\q1 For suddenly shall the wrath of the Lord come forth, 
\q1 And in thy security thou shalt be destroyed, 
\q1 And perish in the day of vengeance. 
\q1
\v 8 Set not thy heart upon goods unjustly gotten; 
\q1 For they shall not profit thee in the day of calamity. 
\q1
\v 9 Winnow not with every wind, 
\q1 And go not into every way: 
\q1 \add For\add* so \add doth\add* the sinner that hath a double tongue. 
\q1
\v 10 Be stedfast in thy understanding; 
\q1 And let thy word be the same. 
\q1
\v 11 Be swift to hear; and let thy life be sincere; 
\q1 And with patience give answer. 
\q1
\v 12 If thou hast understanding, answer \add thy\add* neighbour; 
\q1 If not, lay thy hand upon thy mouth. 
\q1
\v 13 Honour and shame \add is\add* in talk; 
\q1 And the tongue of man \add is\add* his fall. 
\q1
\v 14 Be not called a whisperer, and lie not in wait with thy tongue: 
\q1 For a foul shame is upon the thief, 
\q1 And an evil condemnation upon the double tongue. 
\q1
\v 15 Be not ignorant of any \add thing\add* in a great \add matter\add* or a small. 
\c 6  
\q1
\v 1 Instead of a friend become not an enemy; 
\q1 For \add thereby\add* thou shalt inherit an ill name, shame, and reproach: 
\q1 \add Even\add* so \add shall\add* a sinner that hath a double tongue. 
\q1
\v 2 Extol not thyself in the counsel of thine own heart; 
\q1 That thy soul be not torn in pieces as a bull \add straying alone\add*. 
\q1
\v 3 Thou shalt eat up thy leaves, 
\q1 And lose thy fruit, 
\q1 And leave thyself as a dry tree. 
\q1
\v 4 A wicked soul shall destroy him that hath it, 
\q1 And shall make him to be laughed to scorn of \add his\add* enemies. 
\q1
\v 5 Sweet language will multiply friends: 
\q1 And a fair speaking tongue will increase kind greetings. 
\q1
\v 6 Be in peace with many: 
\q1 Nevertheless \add have but\add* one counseller of a thousand. 
\q1
\v 7 If thou wouldest get a friend, prove him \add first\add*, 
\q1 And be not hasty to credit him. 
\q1
\v 8 For \add some man\add* is a friend for his own occasion, 
\q1 And will not abide in the day of thy trouble. 
\q1
\v 9 And there is a friend, who being turned to enmity and strife 
\q1 Will discover thy reproach. 
\q1
\v 10 Again, \add some\add* friend is a companion at the table, 
\q1 And will not continue in the day of thy affliction. 
\q1
\v 11 But in thy prosperity he will be as thyself, 
\q1 And will be bold over thy servants. 
\q1
\v 12 If thou be brought low, he will be against thee, 
\q1 And will hide himself from thy face. 
\q1
\v 13 Separate thyself from thine enemies, 
\q1 And take heed of thy friends. 
\q1
\v 14 A faithful friend \add is\add* a strong defence: 
\q1 And he that hath found such a one hath found a treasure. 
\q1
\v 15 Nothing doth countervail a faithful friend, 
\q1 And his excellency is unvaluable. 
\q1
\v 16 A faithful friend \add is\add* the medicine of life; 
\q1 And they that fear the Lord shall find him. 
\q1
\v 17 Whoso feareth the Lord shall direct his friendship aright: 
\q1 For as he is, so \add shall\add* his neighbour \add be\add* also. 
\q1
\v 18  \add My\add* son, gather instruction from thy youth up: 
\q1 So shalt thou find wisdom till \add thine\add* old age. 
\q1
\v 19 Come unto her as one that ploweth and soweth, 
\q1 And wait for her good fruits: 
\q1 For thou shalt not toil much in labouring about her, 
\q1 But thou shalt eat of her fruits \add right\add* soon. 
\q1
\v 20 She is very unpleasant to the unlearned: 
\q1 He that is without understanding will not remain with her. 
\q1
\v 21 She will lie upon him as a mighty stone of trial; 
\q1 And he will cast her from \add him\add* ere it be long. 
\q1
\v 22 For wisdom is according to her name, 
\q1 And she is not manifest unto many. 
\q1
\v 23 Give ear, \add my\add* son, receive my advice, 
\q1 And refuse not my counsel, 
\q1
\v 24 And put thy feet into her fetters, 
\q1 And thy neck into her chain. 
\q1
\v 25 Bow down thy shoulder, and bear her, 
\q1 And be not grieved with her bonds. 
\q1
\v 26 Come unto her with thy whole heart, 
\q1 And keep her ways with all thy power. 
\q1
\v 27 Search, and seek, and she shall be made known unto thee: 
\q1 And when thou hast got hold of \add her\add*, let her not go. 
\q1
\v 28 For at the last thou shalt find her rest, 
\q1 And \add that\add* shall be turned to thy joy. 
\q1
\v 29 Then shall her fetters be a strong defence for thee, 
\q1 And her chains a robe of glory. 
\q1
\v 30 For there is a golden ornament upon her, 
\q1 And her bands are purple lace. 
\q1
\v 31 Thou shalt put her on \add as\add* a robe of honour, 
\q1 And shalt put \add her\add* about thee \add as\add* a crown of joy. 
\q1
\v 32  \add My\add* son, if thou wilt, thou shalt be taught: 
\q1 And if thou wilt apply thy mind, thou shalt be prudent. 
\q1
\v 33 If thou love to hear, thou shalt receive understanding: 
\q1 And if thou bow thine ear, thou shalt be wise. 
\q1
\v 34 Stand in the multitude of the elders; 
\q1 And cleave unto him that \add is\add* wise. 
\q1
\v 35 Be willing to hear every godly discourse; 
\q1 And let not the parables of understanding escape thee. 
\q1
\v 36  \add And\add* if thou seest a \add man\add* of understanding, get thee betimes unto him, 
\q1 And let thy foot wear the steps of his door. 
\q1
\v 37 Let thy mind be upon the ordinances of the Lord, 
\q1 And meditate continually in his commandments: 
\q1 He shall establish thine heart, 
\q1 And give thee wisdom at thine own desire. 
\c 7  
\q1
\v 1 Do no evil, so shall no harm come unto thee. 
\q1
\v 2 Depart from the unjust, and iniquity shall turn away from thee. 
\q1
\v 3  \add My\add* son, sow not upon the furrows of unrighteousness, 
\q1 And thou shalt not reap them sevenfold. 
\q1
\v 4 Seek not of the Lord pre-eminence, 
\q1 Neither of the king the seat of honour. 
\q1
\v 5 Justify not thyself before the Lord; 
\q1 And boast not of thy wisdom before the king. 
\q1
\v 6 Seek not to be judge, being not able to take away iniquity; 
\q1 Lest at any time thou fear the person of the mighty, 
\q1 And lay a stumblingblock in \add the way of\add* thy uprightness. 
\q1
\v 7 Offend not against the multitude of a city, 
\q1 And \add then\add* thou shalt not cast thyself down among the people. 
\q1
\v 8 Bind not one sin upon another; 
\q1 For in one thou shalt not be unpunished. 
\q1
\v 9 Say not, \add God\add* will look upon the multitude of my oblations, 
\q1 And when I offer to the most high God, he will accept \add it\add*. 
\q1
\v 10 Be not fainthearted when thou makest thy prayer, 
\q1 And neglect not to give alms. 
\q1
\v 11 Laugh no man to scorn in the bitterness of his soul: 
\q1 For there is one which humbleth and exalteth. 
\q1
\v 12 Devise not a lie against thy brother; 
\q1 Neither do the like to \add thy\add* friend. 
\q1
\v 13 Use not to make any \add manner of\add* lie: 
\q1 For the custom thereof \add is\add* not good. 
\q1
\v 14 Use not many words in a multitude of elders, 
\q1 And make not much babbling when thou prayest. 
\q1
\v 15 Hate not laborious work, 
\q1 Neither husbandry, which the most High hath ordained. 
\q1
\v 16 Number not thyself among the multitude of sinners, 
\q1 \add But\add* remember that wrath will not tarry long. 
\q1
\v 17 Humble thy soul greatly: 
\q1 For the vengeance of the ungodly \add is\add* fire and worms. 
\q1
\v 18 Change not a friend for any good by no means; 
\q1 Neither a faithful brother for the gold of Ophir. 
\q1
\v 19 Forego not a wise and good woman: 
\q1 For her grace \add is\add* above gold. 
\q1
\v 20 Whereas thy servant worketh truly, entreat him not evil, 
\q1 Nor the hireling that bestoweth himself wholly \add for thee\add*. 
\q1
\v 21 Let thy soul love a good servant, 
\q1 \add And\add* defraud him not of liberty. 
\q1
\v 22 Hast thou cattle? have an eye to them: 
\q1 And if they be for thy profit, keep them with thee. 
\q1
\v 23 Hast thou children? instruct them, 
\q1 And bow down their neck from \add their\add* youth. 
\q1
\v 24 Hast thou daughters? have care of their body, 
\q1 And shew not thyself cheerful toward them. 
\q1
\v 25 Marry \add thy\add* daughter, and \add so\add* shalt thou have performed a weighty matter: 
\q1 But give her to a man of understanding. 
\q1
\v 26 Hast thou a wife after \add thy\add* mind? forsake her not: 
\q1 But give not thyself over to a light \add woman\add*. 
\q1
\v 27 Honour thy father with thy whole heart, 
\q1 And forget not the sorrows of thy mother. 
\q1
\v 28 Remember that thou wast begot of them; 
\q1 And how canst thou recompense them \add the things\add* that they \add have done\add* for thee? 
\q1
\v 29 Fear the Lord with all thy soul, 
\q1 And reverence his priests. 
\q1
\v 30 Love him that made thee with all \add thy\add* strength, 
\q1 And forsake not his ministers. 
\q1
\v 31 Fear the Lord, and honour the priest; 
\q1 And give him \add his\add* portion, as it is commanded thee; 
\q1 The firstfruits, and the trespass offering, and the gift of the shoulders, 
\q1 And the sacrifice of sanctification, and the firstfruits of the holy \add things\add*. 
\q1
\v 32 And stretch thine hand unto the poor, 
\q1 That thy blessing may be perfected. 
\q1
\v 33 A gift hath grace in the sight of every \add man\add* living; 
\q1 And for the dead detain it not. 
\q1
\v 34 Fail not to be with them that weep, 
\q1 And mourn with them that mourn. 
\q1
\v 35 Be not slow to visit the sick: 
\q1 For that shall make thee to be beloved. 
\q1
\v 36 Whatsoever thou takest in hand, remember the end, 
\q1 And thou shalt never do amiss. 
\c 8  
\q1
\v 1 Strive not with a mighty man, 
\q1 Lest thou fall into his hands. 
\q1
\v 2 Be not at variance with a rich man, lest he overweigh thee: 
\q1 For gold hath destroyed many, 
\q1 And perverted the hearts of kings. 
\q1
\v 3 Strive not with a man that is full of tongue, 
\q1 And heap not wood upon his fire. 
\q1
\v 4 Jest not with a rude \add man\add*, 
\q1 Lest thy ancestors be disgraced. 
\q1
\v 5 Reproach not a man that turneth from sin, 
\q1 \add But\add* remember that we are all worthy of punishment. 
\q1
\v 6 Dishonour not a man in his old age: 
\q1 For even \add some\add* of us wax old. 
\q1
\v 7 Rejoice not over thy greatest enemy being dead, 
\q1 \add But\add* remember that we die all. 
\q1
\v 8 Despise not the discourse of the wise, 
\q1 But acquaint thyself with their proverbs: 
\q1 For of them thou shalt learn instruction, 
\q1 And \add how\add* to serve great men with ease. 
\q1
\v 9 Miss not the discourse of the elders: 
\q1 For they also learned of their fathers, 
\q1 And of them thou shalt learn understanding, 
\q1 And to give answer as need requireth. 
\q1
\v 10 Kindle not the coals of a sinner, 
\q1 Lest thou be burnt with the flame of his fire. 
\q1
\v 11 Rise not up \add in anger\add* at the presence of an injurious person, 
\q1 Lest he lie in wait to entrap thee in thy words. 
\q1
\v 12 Lend not unto him \add that is\add* mightier than thyself; 
\q1 For if thou lendest \add him\add*, count \add it\add* but lost. 
\q1
\v 13 Be not surety above thy power: 
\q1 For if thou be surety, take care to pay \add it\add*. 
\q1
\v 14 Go not to law with a judge; 
\q1 For they will judge for him according to his honour. 
\q1
\v 15 Travel not by the way with a bold \add fellow\add*, 
\q1 Lest he become grievous unto thee: 
\q1 For he will do according to his own will, 
\q1 And thou shalt perish with \add him\add* through his folly. 
\q1
\v 16 Strive not with an angry \add man\add*, 
\q1 And go not with him into a solitary place: 
\q1 For blood \add is\add* as nothing in his sight; 
\q1 And where there is no help, he will overthrow thee. 
\q1
\v 17 Consult not with a fool; 
\q1 For he cannot keep counsel. 
\q1
\v 18 Do no secret \add thing\add* before a stranger; 
\q1 For thou knowest not what he will bring forth. 
\q1
\v 19 Open not thine heart to every man, 
\q1 Lest he requite thee with a shrewd turn. 
\c 9  
\q1
\v 1 Be not jealous over the wife of thy bosom, 
\q1 And teach \add her\add* not an evil lesson against thyself. 
\q1
\v 2 Give not thy soul unto a woman 
\q1 To set her foot upon thy substance. 
\q1
\v 3 Meet not with a harlot, 
\q1 Lest thou fall into her snares. 
\q1
\v 4 Use not much the company of \add a woman\add* that is a singer, 
\q1 Lest thou be taken with her attempts. 
\q1
\v 5 Gaze not on a maid, 
\q1 That thou fall not by those things that are precious in her. 
\q1
\v 6 Give not thy soul unto harlots, 
\q1 That thou lose not thine inheritance. 
\q1
\v 7 Look not round about thee in the streets of the city, 
\q1 Neither wander thou in the solitary places thereof. 
\q1
\v 8 Turn away thine eye from a beautiful woman, 
\q1 And look not upon another’s beauty; 
\q1 For many have been deceived by the beauty of a woman; 
\q1 For herewith love is kindled as a fire. 
\q1
\v 9 Sit not at all with another man’s wife, 
\q1 Nor sit down with her in \add thine\add* arms, 
\q1 And spend not thy money with her at the wine; 
\q1 Lest thine heart incline unto her, 
\q1 And \add so\add* through thy desire thou fall into destruction. 
\q1
\v 10 Forsake not an old friend; 
\q1 For the new is not comparable to him: 
\q1 A new friend \add is as\add* new wine; 
\q1 When it is old, thou shalt drink it with pleasure. 
\q1
\v 11 Envy not the glory of a sinner: 
\q1 For thou knowest not what shall be his end. 
\q1
\v 12 Delight not in the thing that the ungodly have pleasure in; 
\q1 \add But\add* remember they shall not go unpunished unto their grave. 
\q1
\v 13 Keep thee far from the man that hath power to kill; 
\q1 So shalt thou not doubt the fear of death: 
\q1 And if thou come unto \add him\add*, make no fault, 
\q1 Lest he take away thy life presently: 
\q1 Remember that thou goest in the midst of snares, 
\q1 And \add that\add* thou walkest upon the battlements of the city. 
\q1
\v 14 As near as thou canst, guess at \add thy\add* neighbour, 
\q1 And consult with the wise. 
\q1
\v 15 Let thy talk be with the wise, 
\q1 And all thy communication in the law of the most High. 
\q1
\v 16  \add And\add* let just men eat and drink with thee; 
\q1 And let thy glorying be in the fear of the Lord. 
\q1
\v 17 For the hand of the artificer the work shall be commended: 
\q1 And the wise ruler of the people for his speech. 
\q1
\v 18 A man of an ill tongue \add is\add* dangerous in his city; 
\q1 And he \add that is\add* rash in his talk shall be hated. 
\c 10  
\q1
\v 1 A wise judge will instruct his people; 
\q1 And the government of a prudent \add man\add* is well ordered. 
\q1
\v 2 As the judge of the people is himself, so \add are\add* his officers; 
\q1 And what manner of man the ruler of the city is, \add such are\add* all they that dwell therein. 
\q1
\v 3 An unwise king destroyeth his people; 
\q1 But through the prudence of them which are in authority the city shall be inhabited. 
\q1
\v 4 The power of the earth \add is\add* in the hand of the Lord, 
\q1 And in due time he will set over it one that is profitable. 
\q1
\v 5 In the hand of God \add is\add* the prosperity of man: 
\q1 And upon the person of the scribe shall he lay his honour. 
\q1
\v 6 Bear not hatred to \add thy\add* neighbour for every wrong; 
\q1 And do nothing at all by injurious practices. 
\q1
\v 7 Pride \add is\add* hateful before God and man: 
\q1 And by both doth \add one\add* commit iniquity. 
\q1
\v 8 Because of unrighteous dealings, injuries, and riches got by deceit, 
\q1 The kingdom is translated from one people to another. 
\q1
\v 9 Why is earth and ashes proud? 
\q1 \add There is\add* not a more wicked \add thing\add* than a covetous \add man:\add* 
\q1 For such an one setteth his own soul to sale; 
\q1 Because while he liveth he casteth away his bowels. 
\q1
\v 10 The physician cutteth off a long disease; 
\q1 And \add he that is\add* to day a king to morrow shall die. 
\q1
\v 11 For when a man is dead, 
\q1 He shall inherit creeping things, beasts, and worms. 
\q1
\v 12 The beginning of pride \add is\add* when one departeth from God, 
\q1 And his heart is turned away from his Maker. 
\q1
\v 13 For pride \add is\add* the beginning of sin, 
\q1 And he that hath it shall pour out abomination: 
\q1 \add And\add* therefore the Lord brought upon \add them\add* strange calamities, 
\q1 And overthrew them utterly. 
\q1
\v 14 The Lord hath cast down the thrones of \add proud\add* princes, 
\q1 And set up the meek in their stead. 
\q1
\v 15 The Lord hath plucked up the roots of the proud nations, 
\q1 And planted the lowly in their place. 
\q1
\v 16 The Lord overthrew countries of the heathen, 
\q1 And destroyed them to the foundations of the earth. 
\q1
\v 17 He took \add some\add* of them away, and destroyed them, 
\q1 And hath made their memorial to cease from the earth. 
\q1
\v 18 Pride was not made for men, 
\q1 Nor furious anger for them that are born of a woman. 
\q1
\v 19 They that fear the Lord \add are\add* a sure seed, 
\q1 And they that love him an honourable plant: 
\q1 They that regard not the law \add are\add* a dishonourable seed; 
\q1 They that transgress the commandments \add are\add* a deceivable seed. 
\q1
\v 20 Among brethren he that is chief \add is\add* honourable; 
\q1 So are they that fear the Lord in his eyes. 
\q1
\v 21 The fear of the Lord \add goeth\add* before the obtaining of authority: 
\q1 But roughness and pride \add is\add* the losing thereof. 
\q1
\v 22  \add Whether\add* he \add be\add* rich, noble, or poor, 
\q1 Their glory \add is\add* the fear of the Lord. 
\q1
\v 23  \add It is\add* not meet to despise the poor \add man\add* that hath understanding; 
\q1 Neither is it convenient to magnify a sinful man. 
\q1
\v 24 Great men, and judges, and potentates, shall be honoured; 
\q1 Yet is there none of them greater than he that feareth the Lord. 
\q1
\v 25 Unto the servant \add that is\add* wise shall \add they that are\add* free do service: 
\q1 And he that hath knowledge will not grudge when he is reformed. 
\q1
\v 26 Be not overwise in doing thy business; 
\q1 And boast not thyself in the time of thy distress. 
\q1
\v 27 Better \add is\add* he that laboureth, and aboundeth in all \add things\add*, 
\q1 Than he that boasteth himself, and wanteth bread. 
\q1
\v 28  \add My\add* son, glorify thy soul in meekness, 
\q1 And give it honour according to the dignity thereof. 
\q1
\v 29 Who will justify him that sinneth against his own soul? 
\q1 And who will honour him that dishonoureth his own life? 
\q1
\v 30 The poor \add man\add* is honoured for his skill, 
\q1 And the rich \add man\add* is honoured for his riches. 
\q1
\v 31 He that is honoured in poverty, how much \add more\add* in riches? 
\q1 And \add he that is\add* dishonourable in riches, how much more in poverty? 
\c 11  
\q1
\v 1 Wisdom lifteth up the head of \add him that is\add* of low degree, 
\q1 And maketh him to sit among great men. 
\q1
\v 2 Commend not a man for his beauty; 
\q1 Neither abhor a man for his outward appearance. 
\q1
\v 3 The bee \add is\add* little among such as fly; 
\q1 But her fruit \add is\add* the chief of sweet things. 
\q1
\v 4 Boast not of \add thy\add* clothing and raiment, 
\q1 And exalt not thyself in the day of honour: 
\q1 For the works of the Lord \add are\add* wonderful, 
\q1 And his works among men \add are\add* hidden. 
\q1
\v 5 Many kings have sit down upon the ground; 
\q1 And one that was never thought of hath worn the crown. 
\q1
\v 6 Many mighty men have been greatly disgraced; 
\q1 And the honourable delivered into other \add men\add*’s hands. 
\q1
\v 7 Blame not before thou hast examined \add the truth:\add* 
\q1 Understand first, and then rebuke. 
\q1
\v 8 Answer not before \add thou\add* hast heard \add the cause:\add* 
\q1 Neither interrupt \add men\add* in the midst of \add their\add* talk. 
\q1
\v 9 Strive not in a matter that concerneth thee not; 
\q1 And sit not in judgment with sinners. 
\q1
\v 10  \add My\add* son, meddle not with many matters: 
\q1 For if thou meddle much, thou shalt not be innocent; 
\q1 And if thou follow \add after\add*, thou shalt not obtain, 
\q1 Neither shalt thou escape by fleeing. 
\q1
\v 11 There is one that laboureth, and taketh pains, and maketh haste, 
\q1 And is so much the more behind. 
\q1
\v 12  \add Again\add*, there is \add another that is\add* slow, and hath need of help, 
\q1 Wanting ability, and full of poverty; 
\q1 Yet the eye of the Lord looked upon him for good, 
\q1 And set him up from his low estate, 
\q1
\v 13 And lifted up his head from misery; 
\q1 So that many that saw \add it\add* marvelled at him. 
\q1
\v 14 Prosperity and adversity, life and death, 
\q1 Poverty and riches, come of the Lord. 
\q1
\v 15 Wisdom, knowledge, and understanding of the law, \add are\add* of the Lord: 
\q1 Love, and the way of good works, are from him. 
\q1
\v 16 Error and darkness had their beginning together with sinners: 
\q1 And evil shall wax old with them that glory therein. 
\q1
\v 17 The gift of the Lord remaineth with the godly, 
\q1 And his favour bringeth prosperity for ever. 
\q1
\v 18 There is that waxeth rich by his wariness and pinching, 
\q1 And this \add is\add* the portion of his reward: 
\q1
\v 19 Whereas he saith, I have found rest, 
\q1 And now will eat continually of my goods; 
\q1 And \add yet\add* he knoweth not what time shall come upon him, 
\q1 And \add that\add* he must leave those \add things\add* to others, and die. 
\q1
\v 20 Be stedfast in thy covenant, and be conversant therein, 
\q1 And wax old in thy work. 
\q1
\v 21 Marvel not at the works of sinners; 
\q1 But trust in the Lord, and abide in thy labour: 
\q1 For \add it is\add* an easy \add thing\add* in the sight of the Lord on the sudden to make a poor man rich. 
\q1
\v 22 The blessing of the Lord \add is\add* in the reward of the godly, 
\q1 And suddenly he maketh his blessing to flourish. 
\q1
\v 23 Say not, What profit is there of my service? 
\q1 And what good \add things\add* shall I have hereafter? 
\q1
\v 24  \add Again\add*, say not, I have enough, and possess many \add things\add*, 
\q1 And what evil can come to me hereafter? 
\q1
\v 25 In the day of prosperity \add there is\add* a forgetfulness of affliction: 
\q1 And in the day of affliction there is no remembrance of prosperity. 
\q1
\v 26 For \add it is\add* an easy \add thing\add* unto the Lord in the day of death 
\q1 To reward a man according to his ways. 
\q1
\v 27 The affliction of an hour maketh \add a man\add* forget pleasure: 
\q1 And in his end his deeds shall be discovered. 
\q1
\v 28 Judge none blessed before \add his\add* death: 
\q1 For a man shall be known in his children. 
\q1
\v 29 Bring not every man into thine house: 
\q1 For the deceitful \add man hath\add* many trains. 
\q1
\v 30  \add Like as\add* a partridge taken \add and kept\add* in a cage, so \add is\add* the heart of the proud; 
\q1 And like as a spy, watcheth \add he\add* for \add thy\add* fall: 
\q1
\v 31 For he lieth in wait, and turneth good into evil, 
\q1 And in \add things\add* worthy praise will lay blame upon \add thee\add*. 
\q1
\v 32 Of a spark of fire a heap of coals is kindled: 
\q1 And a sinful man layeth wait for blood. 
\q1
\v 33 Take heed of a mischievous \add man\add*, for he worketh wickedness; 
\q1 Lest he bring upon thee a perpetual blot. 
\q1
\v 34 Receive a stranger into thine house, and he will disturb thee, 
\q1 And turn thee out of thine own. 
\c 12  
\q1
\v 1 When thou wilt do good, know to whom thou doest it; 
\q1 So shalt \add thou\add* be thanked for thy benefits. 
\q1
\v 2 Do good to the godly \add man\add*, and thou shalt find a recompence; 
\q1 And if not from him, yet from the most High. 
\q1
\v 3 There can no good come to him that is always occupied in evil, 
\q1 Nor to him that giveth no alms. 
\q1
\v 4 Give to the godly \add man\add*, 
\q1 And help not a sinner. 
\q1
\v 5 Do well unto \add him that is\add* lowly, but give not to the ungodly: 
\q1 Hold back thy bread, and give \add it\add* not unto him, lest he overmaster thee thereby: 
\q1 For \add else\add* thou shalt receive twice as much evil 
\q1 For all the good thou shalt have done unto him. 
\q1
\v 6 For the most High hateth sinners, 
\q1 And will repay vengeance unto the ungodly, 
\q1 And keepeth them against the mighty day of their punishment. 
\q1
\v 7 Give unto the good, 
\q1 And help not the sinner. 
\q1
\v 8 A friend cannot be known in prosperity: 
\q1 And an enemy cannot be hidden in adversity. 
\q1
\v 9 In the prosperity of a man enemies \add will be\add* grieved: 
\q1 But in his adversity even a friend will depart. 
\q1
\v 10 Never trust thine enemy: 
\q1 For like as iron rusteth, so \add is\add* his wickedness. 
\q1
\v 11 Though he humble himself, and go crouching, 
\q1 \add Yet\add* take good heed and beware of him, 
\q1 And thou shalt be unto him as if thou hadst wiped a lookingglass, 
\q1 And thou shalt know that his rust hath not been altogether wiped away. 
\q1
\v 12 Set him not by thee, 
\q1 Lest, when he hath overthrown thee, he stand \add up\add* in thy place; 
\q1 Neither let him sit at thy right hand, 
\q1 Lest he seek to take thy seat, 
\q1 And thou at the last remember my words, 
\q1 And be pricked therewith. 
\q1
\v 13 Who will pity a charmer \add that is\add* bitten with a serpent, 
\q1 Or any such as come nigh wild beasts? 
\q1
\v 14 So one that goeth to a sinner, 
\q1 And is defiled with \add him\add* in his sins, \add who will pity?\add* 
\q1
\v 15 For a while he will abide with thee, 
\q1 But if thou begin to fall, he will not tarry. 
\q1
\v 16 An enemy speaketh sweetly with his lips, 
\q1 But in his heart he imagineth how to throw thee into a pit: 
\q1 He will weep with his eyes, 
\q1 But if he find opportunity, he will not be satisfied with blood. 
\q1
\v 17 If adversity come upon thee, thou shalt find him there first; 
\q1 And though he pretend to help \add thee, yet\add* shall he undermine thee. 
\q1
\v 18 He will shake his head, and clap his hands, 
\q1 And whisper much, and change his countenance. 
\c 13  
\q1
\v 1 He that toucheth pitch shall be defiled therewith; 
\q1 And he that hath fellowship with a proud \add man\add* shall be like unto him. 
\q1
\v 2 Burden not thyself above thy power while thou livest; 
\q1 And have no fellowship with \add one that is\add* mightier and richer than thyself: 
\q1 \add For\add* how agree the kettle and the earthen pot together? 
\q1 \add For\add* if the one be smitten against the other, it shall be broken. 
\q1
\v 3 The rich \add man\add* hath done wrong, and \add yet\add* he threateneth withal: 
\q1 The poor is wronged, and he must intreat also. 
\q1
\v 4 If thou be for \add his\add* profit, he will use thee: 
\q1 But if thou have nothing, he will forsake thee. 
\q1
\v 5 If thou have \add any thing\add*, he will live with thee: 
\q1 Yea, he will make thee bare, and will not be sorry \add for it\add*. 
\q1
\v 6 If he have need of thee, he will deceive thee, 
\q1 And smile upon thee, and put thee in hope; 
\q1 He will speak thee fair, and say, What wantest thou? 
\q1
\v 7 And he will shame thee by his meats, 
\q1 Until he have drawn thee dry twice or thrice, 
\q1 And at the last he will laugh thee to scorn: 
\q1 Afterward, when he seeth thee, he will forsake thee, 
\q1 And shake his head at thee. 
\q1
\v 8 Beware that thou be not deceived, 
\q1 And brought down in thy jollity. 
\q1
\v 9 If thou be invited of a mighty man, withdraw thyself, 
\q1 And so much the more will he invite thee. 
\q1
\v 10 Press thou not upon \add him\add*, lest thou be put back; 
\q1 Stand not far off, lest thou be forgotten. 
\q1
\v 11 Affect not to be made equal unto him in talk, 
\q1 And believe not his many words: 
\q1 For with much communication will he tempt thee, 
\q1 And smiling upon \add thee\add* will get out thy secrets: 
\q1
\v 12 But cruelly he will lay up thy words, 
\q1 And will not spare to do thee hurt, and to put \add thee\add* in prison. 
\q1
\v 13 Observe, and take good heed, 
\q1 For thou walkest in peril of thy overthrowing: 
\q1 When thou hearest these \add things\add*, awake in thy sleep. 
\q1
\v 14 Love the Lord all \add thy\add* life, 
\q1 And call upon him for thy salvation. 
\q1
\v 15 Every beast loveth his like, 
\q1 And every man loveth his neighbor. 
\q1
\v 16 All flesh consorteth according to kind, 
\q1 And a man will cleave to his like. 
\q1
\v 17 What fellowship hath the wolf with the lamb? 
\q1 So the sinner with the godly. 
\q1
\v 18 What agreement \add is there\add* between the hyena and a dog? 
\q1 And what peace between the rich and the poor? 
\q1
\v 19  \add As\add* the wild ass \add is\add* the lions’ prey in the wilderness: 
\q1 So the rich eat up the poor. 
\q1
\v 20  \add As\add* the proud hate humility: 
\q1 So doth the rich abhor the poor. 
\q1
\v 21 A rich \add man\add* beginning to fall is held up of \add his\add* friends: 
\q1 But a poor \add man\add* being down is thrust also away by \add his\add* friends. 
\q1
\v 22 When a rich \add man\add* is fallen, \add he hath\add* many helpers: 
\q1 He speaketh \add things\add* not to be spoken, and \add yet men\add* justify him: 
\q1 The poor \add man\add* slipt, and \add yet\add* they rebuked him too; 
\q1 He spake wisely, and could have no place. 
\q1
\v 23 When a rich \add man\add* speaketh, every man holdeth his tongue, 
\q1 And \add look\add*, what he saith, they extol it to the clouds: 
\q1 But if the poor \add man\add* speak, they say, What \add fellow is\add* this? 
\q1 And if he stumble, they will help to overthrow him. 
\q1
\v 24 Riches \add are\add* good unto him that hath no sin, 
\q1 And poverty \add is\add* evil in the mouth of the ungodly. 
\q1
\v 25 The heart of a man changeth his countenance, whether \add it be\add* for good or evil: 
\q1 And a merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance. 
\q1
\v 26 A cheerful countenance \add is\add* a token of a heart \add that is\add* in prosperity; 
\q1 And the finding out of parables \add is\add* a wearisome labour of the mind. 
\c 14  
\q1
\v 1 Blessed \add is\add* the man that hath not slipt with his mouth, 
\q1 And is not pricked with the multitude of sins. 
\q1
\v 2 Blessed \add is he\add* whose conscience hath not condemned him, 
\q1 And who is not fallen from his hope in the Lord. 
\q1
\v 3 Riches \add are\add* not comely for a niggard: 
\q1 And what \add should\add* an envious man \add do with\add* money? 
\q1
\v 4 He that gathereth by defrauding his own soul gathereth for others, 
\q1 That shall spend his goods riotously. 
\q1
\v 5 He that is evil to himself, to whom will he be good? 
\q1 He shall not take pleasure in his goods. 
\q1
\v 6 There is none worse than he that envieth himself; 
\q1 And this \add is\add* a recompence of his wickedness. 
\q1
\v 7 And if he doeth good, he doeth it unwillingly; 
\q1 And at the last he will declare his wickedness. 
\q1
\v 8 The envious \add man\add* hath a wicked eye; 
\q1 He turneth away \add his\add* face, and despiseth men. 
\q1
\v 9 A covetous man’s eye is not satisfied with \add his\add* portion; 
\q1 And the iniquity of the wicked drieth up his soul. 
\q1
\v 10 A wicked eye envieth \add his\add* bread, 
\q1 And he \add is\add* a niggard at his table. 
\q1
\v 11  \add My\add* son, according to thy ability do good to thyself, 
\q1 And give the Lord his due offering. 
\q1
\v 12 Remember that death will not be long in coming, 
\q1 And \add that\add* the covenant of the grave is not shewed unto thee. 
\q1
\v 13 Do good unto thy friend before thou die, 
\q1 And according to thy ability stretch out \add thy hand\add* and give to him. 
\q1
\v 14 Defraud not thyself of the good day, 
\q1 And let not the part of a good desire overpass thee. 
\q1
\v 15 Shalt thou not leave thy travails unto another? 
\q1 And thy labours to be divided by lot? 
\q1
\v 16 Give, and take, and sanctify thy soul; 
\q1 For there is no seeking of dainties in the grave. 
\q1
\v 17 All flesh waxeth old as a garment: 
\q1 For the covenant from the beginning \add is\add*, Thou shalt die the death. 
\q1
\v 18 As \add of\add* the green leaves on a thick tree, 
\q1 Some fall, and some grow; 
\q1 So \add is\add* the generation of flesh and blood, 
\q1 One cometh to an end, and another is born. 
\q1
\v 19 Every work rotteth and consumeth away, 
\q1 And the worker thereof shall go withal. 
\q1
\v 20 Blessed \add is\add* the man that doth meditate good \add things\add* in wisdom, 
\q1 And that reasoneth of holy \add things\add* by his understanding. 
\q1
\v 21 He that considereth her ways in his heart 
\q1 Shall also have understanding in her secrets. 
\q1
\v 22 Go after her as one that traceth, 
\q1 And lie in wait in her ways. 
\q1
\v 23 He that prieth in at her windows 
\q1 Shall also hearken at her doors. 
\q1
\v 24 He that doth lodge near her house 
\q1 Shall also fasten a pin in her walls. 
\q1
\v 25 He shall pitch his tent nigh unto her, 
\q1 And shall lodge in a lodging where good \add things\add* are. 
\q1
\v 26 He shall set his children under her shelter, 
\q1 And shall lodge under her branches. 
\q1
\v 27 By her he shall be covered from heat, 
\q1 And in her glory shall he dwell. 
\c 15  
\q1
\v 1 He that feareth the Lord will do good, 
\q1 And he that hath the knowledge of the law shall obtain her. 
\q1
\v 2 And as a mother shall she meet him, 
\q1 And receive him as a wife married of a virgin. 
\q1
\v 3 With the bread of understanding shall she feed him, 
\q1 And give him the water of wisdom to drink. 
\q1
\v 4 He shall be stayed upon her, and shall not be moved; 
\q1 And shall rely upon her, and shall not be confounded. 
\q1
\v 5 She shall exalt him above his neighbours, 
\q1 And in the midst of the congregation shall she open his mouth. 
\q1
\v 6 He shall find joy and a crown of gladness, 
\q1 And she shall cause him to inherit an everlasting name. 
\q1
\v 7 But foolish men shall not attain unto her, 
\q1 And sinners shall not see her. 
\q1
\v 8 For she is far from pride, 
\q1 And men \add that are\add* liars cannot remember her. 
\b
\q1
\v 9 Praise \add is\add* not seemly in the mouth of a sinner, 
\q1 For it was not sent him of the Lord. 
\q1
\v 10 For praise shall be uttered in wisdom, 
\q1 And the Lord will prosper it. 
\q1
\v 11 Say not thou, \add It is\add* through the Lord \add that\add* I fell away: 
\q1 For thou oughtest not to do \add the things\add* that he hateth. 
\q1
\v 12 Say not thou, He hath caused me to err: 
\q1 For he hath no need of the sinful man. 
\q1
\v 13 The Lord hateth all abomination; 
\q1 And they that fear God love it not. 
\q1
\v 14 He himself made man from the beginning, 
\q1 And left him in the hand of his counsel; 
\q1
\v 15 If thou wilt, to keep the commandments, 
\q1 And to perform acceptable faithfulness. 
\q1
\v 16 He hath set fire and water before thee: 
\q1 Stretch forth thy hand unto whether thou wilt. 
\q1
\v 17 Before man \add is\add* life and death; 
\q1 And whether him liketh shall be given him. 
\q1
\v 18 For the wisdom of the Lord \add is\add* great, 
\q1 And he \add is\add* mighty in power, and beholdeth all \add things:\add* 
\q1
\v 19 And his eyes \add are\add* upon them that fear him, 
\q1 And he knoweth every work of man. 
\q1
\v 20 He hath commanded no \add man\add* to do wickedly, 
\q1 Neither hath he given any \add man\add* licence to sin. 
\b
\c  16  
\q1
\v 1 Desire not a multitude of unprofitable children, 
\q1 Neither delight in ungodly sons. 
\q1
\v 2 Though they multiply, rejoice not in them, 
\q1 Except the fear of the Lord be with them. 
\q1
\v 3 Trust not thou in their life, 
\q1 Neither respect their multitude: 
\q1 For one \add that is\add* just \add is\add* better than a thousand; 
\q1 And \add better it is\add* to die without children, than to have them \add that are\add* ungodly. 
\q1
\v 4 For by one that hath understanding shall the city be replenished: 
\q1 But the kindred of the wicked shall speedily become desolate. 
\q1
\v 5 Many such \add things\add* have I seen with mine eyes, 
\q1 And mine ear hath heard greater \add things\add* than these. 
\q1
\v 6 In the congregation of the ungodly shall a fire be kindled; 
\q1 And in a rebellious nation wrath is set on fire. 
\b
\q1
\v 7 He was not pacified towards the old giants, 
\q1 Who fell away in the strength of their foolishness. 
\q1
\v 8 Neither spared he the place where Lot sojourned, 
\q1 But abhorred them for their pride. 
\q1
\v 9 He pitied not the people of perdition, 
\q1 Who were taken away in their sins: 
\q1
\v 10 Nor the six hundred thousand footmen, 
\q1 Who were gathered together in the hardness of their hearts. 
\q1
\v 11 And if there be one stiffnecked among the people, 
\q1 It \add is\add* marvel if he escape unpunished: 
\q1 For mercy and wrath \add are\add* with him; 
\q1 \add He is\add* mighty to forgive, and to pour out displeasure. 
\q1
\v 12 As his mercy is great, so is his correction also: 
\q1 He judgeth a man according to his works. 
\q1
\v 13 The sinner shall not escape with \add his\add* spoils: 
\q1 And the patience of the godly shall not be frustrate. 
\q1
\v 14 Make way for every work of mercy: 
\q1 For every man shall find according to his works. 
\q1
\v 15 The Lord hardened Pharaoh, that \add he\add* should not know him, 
\q1 That his powerful works might be known to the world. 
\q1
\v 16 His mercy \add is\add* manifest to every creature; 
\q1 And he hath separated his light from the darkness with an adamant. 
\q1
\v 17 Say not thou, I will hide myself from the Lord: 
\q1 Shall any remember me from above? 
\q1 I shall not be remembered among \add so\add* many people: 
\q1 For what \add is\add* my soul among \add such\add* an infinite number of creatures? 
\q1
\v 18 Behold, the heaven, and the heaven of heavens, 
\q1 The deep, and the earth, and \add all\add* that therein is, 
\q1 Shall be moved when he shall visit. 
\q1
\v 19 The mountains also and foundations of the earth 
\q1 Shall be shaken with trembling, when the Lord looketh upon them. 
\b
\q1
\v 20 No heart can think upon these \add things\add* worthily: 
\q1 And who is able to conceive his ways? 
\q1
\v 21  \add It is\add* a tempest which no man can see: 
\q1 For the most part of his works are hid. 
\q1
\v 22 Who can declare the works of his justice? or who can endure \add them?\add* 
\q1 For \add his\add* covenant \add is\add* afar off, 
\q1 And the trial of all \add things is\add* in the end. 
\q1
\v 23 He that wanteth understanding will think upon vain \add things:\add* 
\q1 And a foolish man erring imagineth follies. 
\b
\q1
\v 24  \add My\add* son, hearken unto me, and learn knowledge, 
\q1 And mark my words with thy heart. 
\q1
\v 25 I will shew forth doctrine in weight, 
\q1 And declare his knowledge exactly. 
\q1
\v 26 The works of the Lord \add are done\add* in judgment from the beginning: 
\q1 And from the time \add he\add* made them he disposed the parts thereof. 
\q1
\v 27 He garnished his works for ever, 
\q1 And in his hand \add are\add* the chief of them unto all generations: 
\q1 They neither labour, nor are weary, nor cease from their works. 
\q1
\v 28 None of them hindereth another, 
\q1 And they shall never disobey his word. 
\q1
\v 29 After this the Lord looked upon the earth, 
\q1 And filled it with his blessings. 
\q1
\v 30  \add With\add* all \add manner of\add* living things hath he covered the face thereof; 
\q1 And they shall return into it \add again\add*. 
\b
\c  17  
\q1
\v 1 The Lord created man of the earth, 
\q1 And turned him into it again. 
\q1
\v 2 He gave them few days, and a \add short\add* time, 
\q1 And power also over the \add things\add* therein. 
\q1
\v 3 He endued them with strength by themselves, 
\q1 And made them according to his image, 
\q1
\v 4 And put the fear of man upon all flesh, 
\q1 And gave him dominion over beasts and fowls. 
\q1
\v 5  \add They received the use of the five operations of the Lord\add*, 
\q1 And in the sixth place he imparted them understanding, 
\q1 And in the seventh, speech, an interpreter of the cogitations thereof. 
\q1
\v 6 Counsel, and a tongue, and eyes, 
\q1 Ears, and a heart, gave he them to understand. 
\q1
\v 7  \add Withal\add* he filled them \add with\add* the knowledge of understanding, 
\q1 And shewed them good and evil. 
\q1
\v 8 He set his eye upon their hearts, 
\q1 That \add he\add* might shew them the greatness of his works. 
\q1
\v 9 He gave \add them\add* to glory in his marvellous acts for ever, 
\q1 That they might declare his works with understanding. 
\q1
\v 10 And the elect shall praise his holy name. 
\q1
\v 11 Beside \add this\add* he gave them knowledge, 
\q1 And the law of life for an heritage. 
\q1
\v 12 He made an everlasting covenant with them, 
\q1 And shewed them his judgments. 
\q1
\v 13 Their eyes saw the majesty of \add his\add* glory, 
\q1 And their ears heard his glorious voice. 
\q1
\v 14 And he said unto them, Beware of all unrighteousness; 
\q1 And he gave every man commandment concerning \add his\add* neighbour. 
\q1
\v 15 Their ways \add are\add* ever before him, 
\q1 \add And\add* shall not be hid from his eyes. 
\q1
\v 16 Every man from \add his\add* youth \add is given\add* to evil; 
\q1 Neither could they make to themselves fleshy hearts for stony. 
\q1
\v 17 For in the division of the nations of the whole earth 
\q1 He set a ruler over every people; 
\q1 But Israel is the Lord’s portion: 
\q1
\v 18 Whom, being \add his\add* firstborn, he nourisheth with discipline, 
\q1 And giving \add him\add* the light of \add his\add* love doth not forsake him. 
\q1
\v 19 Therefore all their works \add are\add* as the sun before him, 
\q1 And his eyes \add are\add* continually upon their ways. 
\q1
\v 20 None of their unrighteous deeds are hid from him, 
\q1 But all their sins \add are\add* before the Lord 
\q1
\v 21 But the Lord being gracious, and knowing his workmanship, 
\q1 Neither left nor forsook them, but spared them. 
\q1
\v 22 The alms of a man \add is\add* as a signet with him, 
\q1 And he will keep the good deeds of man as the apple \add of the eye\add*, 
\q1 And give repentance to his sons and daughters. 
\q1
\v 23 Afterward he will rise up and reward them, 
\q1 And render their recompence upon their heads. 
\q1
\v 24 But unto them that repent, he granted \add them\add* return, 
\q1 And comforted those that fail \add in\add* patience. 
\q1
\v 25 Return unto the Lord, and forsake \add thy\add* sins, 
\q1 Make thy prayer before \add his\add* face, and offend less. 
\q1
\v 26 Turn again to the most High, and turn away from iniquity: 
\q1 For he will lead \add thee\add* out of darkness into the light of health, 
\q1 And hate thou abomination vehemently. 
\q1
\v 27 Who shall praise the most High in the grave, 
\q1 Instead of them which live and give thanks? 
\q1
\v 28 Thanksgiving perisheth from the dead, as \add from\add* one that is not: 
\q1 The living and sound in heart shall praise the Lord. 
\q1
\v 29 How great \add is\add* the lovingkindness of the Lord our God, 
\q1 And \add his\add* compassion unto such as turn unto him in holiness! 
\q1
\v 30 For all \add things\add* cannot be in men, 
\q1 Because the son of man \add is\add* not immortal. 
\q1
\v 31 What \add is\add* brighter than the sun? yet the light thereof faileth: 
\q1 And flesh and blood will imagine evil. 
\q1
\v 32 He vieweth the power of the height of heaven; 
\q1 And all men \add are but\add* earth and ashes. 
\b
\c  18  
\q1
\v 1 He that liveth for ever created all \add things\add* in general. 
\q1
\v 2 The Lord only is righteous, 
\q1 And there is none other but he, 
\q1
\v 3 Who governeth the world with the palm of his hand, 
\q1 And all \add things\add* obey his will: 
\q1 For he \add is\add* the King of all, by his power 
\q1 Dividing holy \add things\add* among them from profane. 
\q1
\v 4 To whom hath he given power to declare his works? 
\q1 And who shall find out his noble acts? 
\q1
\v 5 Who shall number the strength of his majesty? 
\q1 And who shall also tell out his mercies? 
\q1
\v 6  \add As for\add* the wondrous works of the Lord, there may nothing be taken from \add them\add*, 
\q1 Neither may any thing be put unto \add them\add*, neither can the ground \add of them\add* be found out. 
\q1
\v 7 When a man hath done, then he beginneth; 
\q1 And when he leaveth off, then he shall be doubtful. 
\q1
\v 8 What \add is\add* man, and whereto serveth he? 
\q1 What \add is\add* his good, and what \add is\add* his evil? 
\q1
\v 9 The number of a man’s days at the most \add are\add* an hundred years. 
\q1
\v 10 As a drop of water unto the sea, and a gravel stone \add in comparison of\add* the sand; 
\q1 So \add are\add* a thousand years to the days of eternity. 
\q1
\v 11 Therefore is God patient with them, 
\q1 And poureth forth his mercy upon them. 
\q1
\v 12 He saw and perceived their end to be evil; 
\q1 Therefore he multiplied his compassion. 
\q1
\v 13 The mercy of man \add is\add* toward his neighbour; 
\q1 But the mercy of the Lord \add is\add* upon all flesh: 
\q1 He reproveth, and nurtureth, and teacheth, 
\q1 And bringeth again, as a shepherd his flock. 
\q1
\v 14 He hath mercy on them that receive discipline, 
\q1 And that diligently seek after his judgments. 
\b
\q1
\v 15  \add My\add* son, blemish not \add thy\add* good \add deeds\add*, 
\q1 Neither \add use\add* uncomfortable words when \add thou\add* givest any thing. 
\q1
\v 16 Shall not the dew asswage the heat? 
\q1 So \add is\add* a word better than a gift. 
\q1
\v 17 Lo, \add is\add* not a word better than a gift? 
\q1 But both \add are\add* with a gracious man. 
\q1
\v 18 A fool will upbraid churlishly, 
\q1 And a gift of the envious consumeth the eyes. 
\q1
\v 19 Learn before \add thou\add* speak, 
\q1 And use physick or ever thou be sick. 
\q1
\v 20 Before judgment examine thyself, 
\q1 And in the day of visitation thou shalt find mercy. 
\q1
\v 21 Humble thyself before thou be sick, 
\q1 And in the time of sins shew repentance. 
\q1
\v 22 Let nothing hinder thee to pay \add thy\add* vow in due time, 
\q1 And defer not until death to be justified. 
\q1
\v 23 Before \add thou\add* prayest, prepare thyself; 
\q1 And be not as one that tempteth the Lord. 
\q1
\v 24 Think upon the wrath that shall be at the end, 
\q1 And the time of vengeance, when \add he\add* shall turn away \add his\add* face. 
\q1
\v 25 When \add thou\add* hast enough, remember the time of hunger: 
\q1 And when \add thou\add* art rich, \add think upon\add* poverty and need. 
\q1
\v 26 From the morning until the evening the time is changed, 
\q1 And all \add things\add* are soon \add done\add* before the Lord. 
\q1
\v 27 A wise man will fear in every \add thing\add*, 
\q1 And in the day of sinning he will beware of offence: 
\q1 But a fool will not observe time. 
\q1
\v 28 Every man of understanding knoweth wisdom, 
\q1 And will give praise unto him that found her. 
\q1
\v 29  \add They that were\add* of understanding in sayings became also wise themselves, 
\q1 And poured forth exquisite parables. 
\q1
\v 30 Go not after thy lusts, 
\q1 But refrain thyself from thine appetites. 
\q1
\v 31 If thou givest thy soul the desires that please \add her\add*, 
\q1 She will make thee a laughingstock to thine enemies that malign thee. 
\q1
\v 32 Take not pleasure in much good cheer, 
\q1 Neither be tied to the expence thereof. 
\q1
\v 33 Be not made a beggar by banqueting upon borrowing, 
\q1 When thou hast nothing in \add thy\add* purse: 
\q1 For thou shalt lie in wait for thine own life, \add and be\add* talked on. 
\c 19  
\q1
\v 1 A labouring man \add that is\add* given to drunkenness shall not be rich: 
\q1 And he that contemneth small \add things\add* shall fall by little and little. 
\q1
\v 2 Wine and women will make men of understanding to fall away: 
\q1 And he that cleaveth to harlots will become impudent. 
\q1
\v 3 Moths and worms shall have him to heritage, 
\q1 And a bold man shall be taken away. 
\q1
\v 4 He that is hasty to give credit \add is\add* lightminded; 
\q1 And he that sinneth shall offend against his own soul. 
\q1
\v 5 Whoso taketh pleasure in wickedness shall be condemned: 
\q1 But he that resisteth pleasures crowneth his life. 
\b
\q1
\v 6 He that can rule \add his\add* tongue shall live without strife; 
\q1 And he that hateth babbling shall have less evil. 
\q1
\v 7 Rehearse not unto another that which is told unto thee, 
\q1 And thou shalt fare never the worse. 
\q1
\v 8 Whether it be to friend or foe, talk not of other men’s lives; 
\q1 And if thou canst without offence, reveal \add them\add* not. 
\q1
\v 9 For he heard and observed thee, 
\q1 And when time cometh he will hate thee. 
\q1
\v 10  \add If\add* thou hast heard a word, let it die with thee; 
\q1 And be bold, it will not burst thee. 
\q1
\v 11 A fool travaileth with a word, 
\q1 As a \add woman\add* in labour of a child. 
\q1
\v 12  \add As\add* an arrow that sticketh in a man’s thigh, 
\q1 So \add is\add* a word within a fool’s belly. 
\q1
\v 13 Admonish a friend, it may be he hath not done \add it:\add* 
\q1 And if he have done \add it\add*, that he do \add it\add* no more. 
\q1
\v 14 Admonish \add thy\add* friend, it may be he hath not said \add it:\add* 
\q1 And if he have, that he speak \add it\add* not again. 
\q1
\v 15 Admonish a friend: for many times it is a slander, 
\q1 And believe not every tale. 
\q1
\v 16 There is one that slippeth in \add his\add* speech, but not from \add his\add* heart; 
\q1 And who is he that hath not offended with his tongue? 
\q1
\v 17 Admonish thy neighbour before \add thou\add* threaten \add him;\add* 
\q1 And not being angry, give place to the law of the most High. 
\q1
\v 18 The fear of the Lord \add is\add* the first step to be accepted \add of him\add*, 
\q1 And wisdom obtaineth his love. 
\q1
\v 19 The knowledge of the commandments of the Lord \add is\add* the doctrine of life: 
\q1 And they that do \add things\add* that please him shall receive the fruit of the tree of immortality. 
\q1
\v 20 The fear of the Lord \add is\add* all wisdom; 
\q1 And in all wisdom \add is\add* the performance of the law, 
\q1 And the knowledge of his omnipotency. 
\q1
\v 21 If a servant say to \add his\add* master, I will not do as it pleaseth \add thee;\add* 
\q1 Though afterward he do \add it\add*, he angereth him that nourisheth him. 
\q1
\v 22 The knowledge of wickedness is not wisdom, 
\q1 Neither at any time the counsel of sinners prudence. 
\q1
\v 23 There is a wickedness, and the same an abomination; 
\q1 And there is a fool wanting in wisdom. 
\q1
\v 24 He that hath small understanding, \add and\add* feareth \add God, is\add* better 
\q1 Than one that hath much wisdom, and transgresseth the law of the most High. 
\q1
\v 25 There is an exquisite subtilty, and the same \add is\add* unjust; 
\q1 And there is one that turneth aside to make judgment appear; 
\q1 And there is a wise \add man\add* that justifieth in judgment. 
\q1
\v 26 There is a wicked \add man\add* that hangeth down \add his head\add* sadly; 
\q1 But inwardly he \add is\add* full of deceit, 
\q1
\v 27 Casting down \add his\add* countenance, and making as if he heard not: 
\q1 Where he is not known, he will do thee a mischief before thou be aware. 
\q1
\v 28 And if for want of power he be hindered from sinning, 
\q1 \add Yet\add* when he findeth opportunity he will do evil. 
\q1
\v 29 A man may be known by \add his\add* look, 
\q1 And one that hath understanding by \add his\add* countenance, when thou meetest \add him\add*. 
\q1
\v 30 A man’s attire, and excessive laughter, 
\q1 And gait, shew what he is. 
\b
\c  20  
\q1
\v 1 There is a reproof that is not comely: 
\q1 Again, some man holdeth his tongue, and he \add is\add* wise. 
\q1
\v 2 It is much better to reprove, than to be angry secretly: 
\q1 And he that confesseth his fault shall be preserved from hurt. 
\q1
\v 3 How good \add is it,\add* when \add thou\add* art reproved, to shew repentance! 
\q1 For so shalt thou escape wilful sin. 
\q1
\v 4  \add As is\add* the lust of an eunuch to deflower a virgin; 
\q1 So \add is\add* he that executeth judgment with violence. 
\q1
\v 5 There is one that keepeth silence, and is found wise: 
\q1 And \add another\add* by much babbling becometh hateful. 
\q1
\v 6 Some man holdeth his tongue, because he hath not to answer: 
\q1 And some keepeth silence, knowing \add his\add* time. 
\q1
\v 7 A wise man will hold his tongue till \add he see\add* opportunity: 
\q1 But a babbler and a fool will regard no time. 
\q1
\v 8 He that useth many words shall be abhorred; 
\q1 And he that taketh to himself authority therein shall be hated. 
\b
\q1
\v 9 There is a sinner that hath good success in evil \add things;\add* 
\q1 And there is a gain \add that turneth\add* to loss. 
\q1
\v 10 There is a gift that shall not profit thee; 
\q1 And there is a gift whose recompence \add is\add* double. 
\q1
\v 11 There is an abasement because of glory; 
\q1 And there is that lifteth up \add his\add* head from a low estate. 
\q1
\v 12 There is that buyeth much for a little, 
\q1 And repayeth it sevenfold. 
\q1
\v 13 A wise \add man\add* by \add his\add* words maketh himself beloved: 
\q1 But the graces of fools shall be poured out. 
\q1
\v 14 The gift of a fool shall do thee no good when thou hast \add it;\add* 
\q1 Neither yet of the envious for his necessity: 
\q1 For he looketh to receive many \add things\add* for one. 
\q1
\v 15 He giveth little, and upbraideth much; 
\q1 He openeth his mouth like a crier; 
\q1 To day he lendeth, and to morrow will he ask \add it\add* again: 
\q1 Such a one \add is\add* to be hated of God and man. 
\q1
\v 16 The fool saith, I have no friends, 
\q1 \add I\add* have no thank for \add all\add* my good \add deeds\add*, 
\q1 And they that eat my bread speak evil \add of me\add*. 
\q1
\v 17 How oft, and of how many shall he be laughed to scorn! 
\q1 For he knoweth not aright what it is to have; 
\q1 And it is all one unto him as if he had \add it\add* not. 
\b
\q1
\v 18 To slip upon a pavement \add is\add* better than \add to slip\add* with the tongue: 
\q1 So the fall of the wicked shall come speedily. 
\q1
\v 19 An unseasonable tale 
\q1 Will always be in the mouth of the unwise. 
\q1
\v 20 A wise sentence shall be rejected \add when it cometh\add* out of a fool’s mouth; 
\q1 For he will not speak it in due season. 
\q1
\v 21 There is that is hindered from sinning through want: 
\q1 And when he taketh rest, he shall not be troubled. 
\q1
\v 22 There is that destroyeth his own soul through bashfulness, 
\q1 And by accepting of persons overthroweth himself. 
\q1
\v 23 There is that for bashfulness promiseth to \add his\add* friend, 
\q1 And maketh him \add his\add* enemy for nothing. 
\q1
\v 24 A lie \add is\add* a foul blot in a man, 
\q1 Yet it is continually in the mouth of the untaught. 
\q1
\v 25 A thief \add is\add* better than \add a man\add* that is accustomed to lie: 
\q1 But they both shall have destruction to heritage. 
\q1
\v 26 The disposition of a liar \add is\add* dishonourable, 
\q1 And his shame \add is\add* ever with him. 
\b
\q1
\v 27 A wise \add man\add* shall promote himself \add to honour\add* with \add his\add* words: 
\q1 And he that hath understanding will please great men. 
\q1
\v 28 He that tilleth his land shall increase his heap: 
\q1 And he that pleaseth great men shall get pardon for iniquity. 
\q1
\v 29 Presents and gifts blind the eyes of the wise, 
\q1 And stop up \add his\add* mouth that he cannot reprove. 
\q1
\v 30 Wisdom that is hid, and treasure \add that is\add* hoarded up, 
\q1 What profit \add is\add* in \add them\add* both? 
\q1
\v 31 Better \add is\add* he that hideth his folly 
\q1 Than a man that hideth his wisdom. 
\q1
\v 32 Necessary patience in seeking the Lord \add is\add* better 
\q1 Than he that leadeth his life without a guide. 
\b
\c  21  
\q1
\v 1  \add My\add* son, hast thou sinned? do so no more, 
\q1 But ask pardon for thy former \add sins\add*. 
\q1
\v 2 Flee from sin as from the face of a serpent: 
\q1 For if thou comest \add too\add* near it, it will bite thee: 
\q1 The teeth thereof \add are\add* as the teeth of a lion, 
\q1 Slaying the souls of men. 
\q1
\v 3 All iniquity \add is\add* as a twoedged sword, 
\q1 The wounds whereof cannot \add be\add* healed. 
\q1
\v 4 To terrify and do wrong will waste riches: 
\q1 Thus the house of proud \add men\add* shall be made desolate. 
\q1
\v 5 A prayer out of a poor \add man\add*’s mouth \add reacheth\add* to the ears \add of God\add*, 
\q1 And his judgment cometh speedily. 
\q1
\v 6 He that hateth to be reproved \add is\add* in the way of sinners: 
\q1 But he that feareth the Lord will repent from his heart. 
\q1
\v 7 An eloquent man \add is\add* known far and near; 
\q1 But a man of understanding knoweth when he slippeth. 
\q1
\v 8 He that buildeth his house with other men’s money 
\q1 \add Is\add* like one that gathereth himself stones for the tomb of his burial. 
\q1
\v 9 The congregation of the wicked \add is like\add* tow wrapped together: 
\q1 And the end of them \add is\add* a flame of fire to destroy \add them\add*. 
\q1
\v 10 The way of sinners \add is\add* made plain with stones, 
\q1 But at the end thereof \add is\add* the pit of hell. 
\q1
\v 11 He that keepeth the law of the Lord getteth the understanding thereof: 
\q1 And the perfection of the fear of the Lord \add is\add* wisdom. 
\q1
\v 12 He that is not wise will not be taught: 
\q1 But there is a wisdom which multiplieth bitterness. 
\q1
\v 13 The knowledge of a wise \add man\add* shall abound like a flood: 
\q1 And his counsel \add is\add* like a pure fountain of life. 
\q1
\v 14 The inner parts of a fool \add are\add* like a broken vessel, 
\q1 And he will hold no knowledge as long as he liveth. 
\q1
\v 15 If a skilful man hear a wise word, 
\q1 He will commend it, and add unto it: 
\q1 \add But\add* as soon as one of no understanding heareth \add it\add*, it displeaseth him, 
\q1 And he casteth it behind his back. 
\q1
\v 16 The talking of a fool \add is\add* like a burden in the way: 
\q1 But grace shall be found in the lips of the wise. 
\q1
\v 17 They inquire at the mouth of the wise \add man\add* in the congregation, 
\q1 And they shall ponder his words in \add their\add* heart. 
\q1
\v 18 As \add is\add* a house that is destroyed, so \add is\add* wisdom to a fool: 
\q1 And the knowledge of the unwise \add is as\add* talk without sense. 
\q1
\v 19 Doctrine unto fools \add is as\add* fetters on the feet, 
\q1 And like manacles on the right hand. 
\q1
\v 20 A fool lifteth up his voice with laughter; 
\q1 But a wise \add man\add* doth scarce smile a little. 
\q1
\v 21 Learning \add is\add* unto a wise \add man as\add* an ornament of gold, 
\q1 And like a bracelet upon his right arm. 
\q1
\v 22 A foolish man’s foot \add is\add* soon in \add his neighbour’s\add* house: 
\q1 But a man of experience is ashamed of him. 
\q1
\v 23 A fool will peep in at the door into the house: 
\q1 But he that is well nurtured will stand without. 
\q1
\v 24  \add It is\add* the rudeness of a man to hearken at the door: 
\q1 But a wise \add man\add* will be grieved with disgrace. 
\q1
\v 25 The lips of talkers will be telling such \add things\add* as pertain not unto them: 
\q1 But the words of such as have understanding are weighed in the balance. 
\q1
\v 26 The heart of fools \add is\add* in their mouth: 
\q1 But the mouth of the wise \add is\add* in their heart. 
\q1
\v 27 When the ungodly curseth Satan, 
\q1 He curseth his own soul. 
\q1
\v 28 A whisperer defileth his own soul, 
\q1 And is hated wheresoever he dwelleth. 
\b
\c  22  
\q1
\v 1 A slothful \add man\add* is compared to a filthy stone, 
\q1 And every one will hiss \add him\add* out to his disgrace. 
\q1
\v 2 A slothful \add man\add* is compared to the filth of a dunghill: 
\q1 Every \add man\add* that takes it up will shake \add his\add* hand. 
\q1
\v 3 An evil nurtured son \add is\add* the dishonour of his father that begat him: 
\q1 And a \add foolish\add* daughter is born to \add his\add* loss. 
\q1
\v 4 A wise daughter shall bring an inheritance to her husband: 
\q1 But she that liveth dishonestly \add is\add* her father’s heaviness. 
\q1
\v 5 She \add that is\add* bold dishonoureth \add both her\add* father and \add her\add* husband, 
\q1 But they both shall despise her. 
\q1
\v 6 A tale out of season \add is as\add* musick in mourning: 
\q1 But stripes and correction of wisdom \add are\add* never out of time. 
\q1
\v 7 Whoso teacheth a fool \add is as\add* one that glueth a potsherd together, 
\q1 \add And as\add* he that waketh one from a sound sleep. 
\q1
\v 8 He that telleth a tale to a fool speaketh to one in a slumber: 
\q1 When \add he\add* hath told \add his\add* tale, he will say, What is the matter? 
\q1
\v 9 If children live honestly, and have wherewithal, 
\q1 They shall cover the baseness of their parents. 
\q1
\v 10  \add But\add* children, being haughty, through disdain and want of nurture 
\q1 Do stain the nobility of their kindred. 
\q1
\v 11 Weep for the dead, for he hath lost the light: 
\q1 And weep for the fool, for he wanteth understanding: 
\q1 Make little weeping for the dead, for he is at rest: 
\q1 But the life of the fool \add is\add* worse than death. 
\q1
\v 12 Seven days \add do men\add* mourn for \add him that is\add* dead; 
\q1 But for a fool and an ungodly \add man\add*, all the days of his life. 
\q1
\v 13 Talk not much with a fool, 
\q1 And go not to him that hath no understanding: 
\q1 Beware of him, lest thou have trouble, 
\q1 And thou shalt never be defiled with his fooleries: 
\q1 Depart from him, and thou shalt find rest, 
\q1 And never be disquieted with madness. 
\q1
\v 14 What is heavier than lead? 
\q1 And what \add is\add* the name thereof, but a fool? 
\q1
\v 15 Sand, and salt, and a mass of iron, \add is\add* easier to bear, 
\q1 Than a man without understanding. 
\q1
\v 16  \add As\add* timber girt and bound together in a building cannot be loosed with shaking: 
\q1 So the heart that is stablished by advised counsel shall fear at no time. 
\q1
\v 17 A heart settled upon a thought of understanding 
\q1 \add Is\add* as a fair plaistering on the wall of a gallery. 
\q1
\v 18 Pales set on a high place will never stand against the wind: 
\q1 So a fearful heart in the imagination of a fool cannot stand against any fear. 
\q1
\v 19 He that pricketh the eye will make tears to fall: 
\q1 And he that pricketh the heart maketh \add it\add* to shew \add her\add* knowledge. 
\q1
\v 20 Whoso casteth a stone at the birds frayeth them away: 
\q1 And he that upbraideth \add his\add* friend breaketh friendship. 
\q1
\v 21 Though thou drewest a sword at thy friend, \add yet\add* despair not: 
\q1 For there may be a returning \add to favour\add*. 
\q1
\v 22 If thou hast opened thy mouth against thy friend, fear not; 
\q1 For there may be a reconciliation: 
\q1 Except \add for\add* upbraiding, or pride, or disclosing of secrets, or a treacherous wound: 
\q1 For, for these \add things\add* every friend will depart. 
\q1
\v 23 Be faithful to \add thy\add* neighbour in \add his\add* poverty, 
\q1 That thou mayest rejoice in his prosperity: 
\q1 Abide stedfast unto him in the time of \add his\add* trouble, 
\q1 That thou mayest be heir with \add him\add* in his heritage: 
\q1 For a mean estate \add is\add* not always to be contemned: 
\q1 Nor the rich that is foolish to be had in admiration. 
\q1
\v 24  \add As\add* the vapour and smoke of a furnace \add goeth\add* before the fire; 
\q1 So reviling before blood. 
\q1
\v 25 I will not be ashamed to defend a friend; 
\q1 Neither will I hide myself from him. 
\q1
\v 26 And if \add any\add* evil happen unto me by him, 
\q1 Every one that heareth \add it\add* will beware of him. 
\q1
\v 27 Who shall set a watch before my mouth, 
\q1 And a seal of wisdom upon my lips, 
\q1 That I fall not suddenly by them, 
\q1 And \add that\add* my tongue destroy me not? 
\c 23  
\q1
\v 1 O Lord, Father and Governor of all my whole life, 
\q1 Leave me not to their counsels, 
\q1 And let me not fall by them. 
\q1
\v 2 Who will set scourges over my thoughts, 
\q1 And the discipline of wisdom over mine heart? 
\q1 That they spare \add me\add* not for mine ignorances, 
\q1 And it pass not by my sins: 
\q1
\v 3 Lest mine ignorances increase, 
\q1 And my sins abound to \add my\add* destruction, 
\q1 And I fall before \add mine\add* adversaries, 
\q1 And mine enemy rejoice over me, 
\q1 Whose hope is far from thy mercy. 
\q1
\v 4 O Lord, Father and God of my life, 
\q1 Give me not a proud look, 
\q1 But turn away from thy servants always a haughty mind. 
\q1
\v 5 Turn away from me vain hopes and concupiscence, 
\q1 And thou shalt hold him up that is desirous always to serve thee. 
\q1
\v 6 Let not the greediness of the belly nor lust of the flesh take hold of me; 
\q1 And give not over me thy servant into an impudent mind. 
\b
\q1
\v 7 Hear, O \add ye\add* children, the discipline of the mouth: 
\q1 He that keepeth \add it\add* shall never be taken in his lips. 
\q1
\v 8 The sinner shall be left in his foolishness: 
\q1 Both the evil speaker and the proud shall fall thereby. 
\q1
\v 9 Accustom not thy mouth to swearing; 
\q1 Neither use thyself to the naming of the Holy One. 
\q1
\v 10 For as a servant that is continually beaten shall not be without a blue mark: 
\q1 So he that sweareth and nameth \add God\add* continually shall not be faultless. 
\q1
\v 11 A man that useth much swearing shall be filled with iniquity, 
\q1 And the plague shall never depart from his house: 
\q1 If he shall offend, his sin \add shall be\add* upon him: 
\q1 And if he acknowledge not \add his sin\add*, he maketh a double offence: 
\q1 And if he swear in vain, he shall not be innocent, 
\q1 But his house shall be full of calamities. 
\q1
\v 12 There is a word that is clothed about with death: 
\q1 God grant that it be not found in the heritage of Jacob; 
\q1 For all such \add things\add* shall be far from the godly, 
\q1 And they shall not wallow in \add their\add* sins. 
\q1
\v 13 Use not thy mouth to untemperate swearing, 
\q1 For therein is the word of sin. 
\q1
\v 14 Remember \add thy\add* father and thy mother, 
\q1 When thou sittest among great men. 
\q1 Be not forgetful before them, 
\q1 And \add so\add* thou by thy custom become a fool, 
\q1 And wish that thou hadst not been born, 
\q1 And curse the day of thy nativity. 
\q1
\v 15 The man that is accustomed to opprobrious words 
\q1 Will never be reformed all the days of his \add life\add*. 
\b
\q1
\v 16 Two sorts \add of men\add* multiply sin, 
\q1 And the third will bring wrath: 
\q1 A hot mind \add is\add* as a burning fire, 
\q1 It will never be quenched till it be consumed: 
\q1 A fornicator in the body of his flesh 
\q1 Will never cease till he hath kindled a fire. 
\q1
\v 17 All bread \add is\add* sweet to a whoremonger, 
\q1 He will not leave off till he die. 
\q1
\v 18 A man that breaketh wedlock, 
\q1 Saying \add thus\add* in his heart, Who seeth me? 
\q1 I am compassed about with darkness, 
\q1 The walls cover me, 
\q1 And no body seeth me: what need I to fear? 
\q1 The most High will not remember my sins: 
\q1
\v 19 Such a man \add only\add* feareth the eyes of men, 
\q1 And knoweth not that the eyes of the Lord are ten thousand times brighter than the sun, 
\q1 Beholding all the ways of men, 
\q1 And considering the \add most\add* secret parts. 
\q1
\v 20 He knew all \add things\add* ere ever \add they\add* were created; 
\q1 So also after \add they\add* were perfected he looked upon \add them\add* all. 
\q1
\v 21 This \add man\add* shall be punished in the streets of the city, 
\q1 And where he suspecteth not he shall be taken. 
\q1
\v 22 Thus \add shall it go\add* also \add with\add* the wife that leaveth her husband, 
\q1 And bringeth in an heir by another. 
\q1
\v 23 For first, she hath disobeyed the law of the most High; 
\q1 And secondly, she hath trespassed against her own husband; 
\q1 And thirdly, she hath played the whore in adultery, 
\q1 And brought children by another man. 
\q1
\v 24 She shall be brought out into the congregation, 
\q1 And inquisition shall be made of her children. 
\q1
\v 25 Her children shall not take root, 
\q1 And her branches shall bring forth no fruit. 
\q1
\v 26 She shall leave her memory to be cursed, 
\q1 And her reproach shall not be blotted out. 
\q1
\v 27 And they that remain shall know that \add there is\add* nothing better than the fear of the Lord, 
\q1 And \add that there is\add* nothing sweeter than to take heed unto the commandments of the Lord. 
\q1
\v 28  \add It is\add* great glory to follow the Lord, 
\q1 And to be received of him \add is\add* long life. 
\b
\c  24  
\q1
\v 1 Wisdom shall praise herself, 
\q1 And shall glory in the midst of her people. 
\q1
\v 2 In the congregation of the most High shall she open her mouth, 
\q1 And triumph before his power. 
\q1
\v 3 I came out of the mouth of the most High, 
\q1 And covered the earth as a cloud. 
\q1
\v 4 I dwelt in high \add places\add*, 
\q1 And my throne \add is\add* in a cloudy pillar. 
\q1
\v 5 I alone compassed the circuit of heaven, 
\q1 And walked in the bottom of the deep. 
\q1
\v 6 In the waves of the sea, and in all the earth, 
\q1 And in every people and nation, I got a possession. 
\q1
\v 7 With all these I sought rest: 
\q1 And in whose inheritance shall I abide? 
\q1
\v 8 So the Creator of all \add things\add* gave me a commandment, 
\q1 And he that made me caused my tabernacle to rest, 
\q1 And said, Let thy dwelling be in Jacob, 
\q1 And thine inheritance in Israel. 
\q1
\v 9 He created me from the beginning before the world, 
\q1 And I shall never fail. 
\q1
\v 10 In the holy tabernacle I served before him; 
\q1 And so was I established in Sion. 
\q1
\v 11 Likewise in the beloved city he gave me rest, 
\q1 And in Jerusalem \add was\add* my power. 
\q1
\v 12 And I took root in an honourable people, 
\q1 \add Even\add* in the portion of the Lord’s inheritance. 
\q1
\v 13 I was exalted like a cedar in Libanus, 
\q1 And as a cypress tree upon the mountains of Hermon. 
\q1
\v 14 I was exalted like a palm tree in Engaddi, 
\q1 And as a rose plant in Jericho, 
\q1 As a fair olive tree in a pleasant field, 
\q1 And grew up as a plane tree by the water. 
\q1
\v 15 I gave a sweet smell like cinnamon and aspalathus, 
\q1 And I yielded a pleasant odour like the best myrrh, 
\q1 As galbanum, and onyx, and sweet storax, 
\q1 And as the fume of frankincense in the tabernacle. 
\q1
\v 16 As the turpentine tree I stretched out my branches, 
\q1 And my branches \add are\add* the branches of honour and grace. 
\q1
\v 17 As the vine brought I forth pleasant savour, 
\q1 And my flowers \add are\add* the fruit of honour and riches. 
\q1
\v 18 I \add am\add* the mother of fair love, 
\q1 And fear, and knowledge, and holy hope: 
\q1 I therefore, \add being\add* eternal, am given to all my children 
\q1 Which are named of him. 
\q1
\v 19 Come unto me, all \add ye\add* that be desirous of me, 
\q1 And fill yourselves with my fruits. 
\q1
\v 20 For my memorial \add is\add* sweeter than honey, 
\q1 And mine inheritance than the honeycomb. 
\q1
\v 21 They that eat me shall yet be hungry, 
\q1 And they that drink me shall yet be thirsty. 
\q1
\v 22 He that obeyeth me shall never be confounded, 
\q1 And they that work by me shall not do amiss. 
\q1
\v 23 All these \add things are\add* the book of the covenant of the most high God, 
\q1 \add Even\add* the law which Moses commanded 
\q1 \add For\add* an heritage unto the congregations of Jacob. 
\q1
\v 24 Faint not to be strong in the Lord; 
\q1 That he may confirm you, cleave unto him: 
\q1 \add For\add* the Lord Almighty is God alone, 
\q1 And beside him there is no other Saviour. 
\q1
\v 25 He filleth all \add things\add* with his wisdom, as Phison 
\q1 And as Tigris in the time of the new \add fruits\add*. 
\q1
\v 26 He maketh the understanding to abound like Euphrates, 
\q1 And as Jordan in the time of the harvest. 
\q1
\v 27 He maketh the doctrine of knowledge appear as the light, 
\q1 And as Geon in the time of vintage. 
\q1
\v 28 The first \add man\add* knew her not perfectly: 
\q1 No more shall the last find her out. 
\q1
\v 29 For her thoughts are more than the sea, 
\q1 And her counsels profounder than the great deep. 
\q1
\v 30 I also came out as a brook from a river, 
\q1 And as a conduit into a garden. 
\q1
\v 31 I said, I will water my best garden, 
\q1 And will water abundantly my garden bed: 
\q1 And lo, my brook became a river, 
\q1 And my river became a sea. 
\q1
\v 32 I will yet make doctrine to shine as the morning, 
\q1 And will send forth her light afar off. 
\q1
\v 33 I will yet pour out doctrine as prophecy, 
\q1 And leave it to all ages for ever. 
\q1
\v 34 Behold that I have not laboured for myself only, 
\q1 But for all them that seek wisdom. 
\b
\c  25  
\q1
\v 1 In three \add things\add* I was beautified, 
\q1 And stood up beautiful \add both\add* before God and men: 
\q1 The unity of brethren, the love of neighbours, 
\q1 A man and a wife that agree together. 
\q1
\v 2 Three sorts \add of men\add* my soul hateth, 
\q1 And I am greatly offended at their life: 
\q1 A poor \add man that is\add* proud, a rich \add man that is\add* a liar, 
\q1 And an old adulterer that doateth. 
\q1
\v 3 If thou hast gathered nothing in thy youth, 
\q1 How canst thou find \add any thing\add* in thine age? 
\q1
\v 4 O how comely \add a thing is\add* judgment for gray hairs, 
\q1 And for ancient \add men\add* to know counsel! 
\q1
\v 5 O how comely \add is\add* the wisdom of old men, 
\q1 And understanding and counsel to men of honour! 
\q1
\v 6 Much experience \add is\add* the crown of old men, 
\q1 And the fear of God \add is\add* their glory. 
\b
\q1
\v 7  \add There be\add* nine things \add which\add* I have judged in mine heart to be happy, 
\q1 And the tenth I will utter with my tongue: 
\q1 A man that hath joy of \add his\add* children; 
\q1 And he that liveth to see the fall of \add his\add* enemy: 
\q1
\v 8 Well \add is\add* him that dwelleth with a wife of understanding, 
\q1 And that hath not slipped with \add his\add* tongue, 
\q1 And that hath not served \add a man more\add* unworthy than himself: 
\q1
\v 9 Well \add is\add* him that hath found prudence, 
\q1 And he that speaketh in the ears of them that \add will\add* hear: 
\q1
\v 10 O how great \add is\add* he that findeth wisdom! 
\q1 Yet is there none above him that feareth the Lord. 
\q1
\v 11 But the love of the Lord passeth all \add things\add* for illumination: 
\q1 He that holdeth it, whereto shall he be likened? 
\q1
\v 12 The fear of the Lord \add is\add* the beginning of his love: 
\q1 And faith \add is\add* the beginning of cleaving unto him. 
\b
\q1
\v 13  \add Give me\add* any plague, but the plague of the heart: 
\q1 And any wickedness, but the wickedness of a woman: 
\q1
\v 14 And any affliction, but the affliction from them that hate \add me:\add* 
\q1 And any revenge, but the revenge of enemies. 
\q1
\v 15 There is no head above the head of a serpent; 
\q1 And there is no wrath above the wrath of an enemy. 
\q1
\v 16 I had rather dwell with a lion and a dragon, 
\q1 Than to keep house with a wicked woman. 
\q1
\v 17 The wickedness of a woman changeth her face, 
\q1 And darkeneth her countenance like sackcloth. 
\q1
\v 18 Her husband shall sit among his neighbours; 
\q1 And when he heareth \add it\add* shall sigh bitterly. 
\q1
\v 19 All wickedness \add is but\add* little to the wickedness of a woman: 
\q1 Let the portion of a sinner fall upon her. 
\q1
\v 20 As the climbing up a sandy way \add is\add* to the feet of the aged, 
\q1 So \add is\add* a wife full of words to a quiet man. 
\q1
\v 21 Stumble not at the beauty of a woman, 
\q1 And desire her not for pleasure. 
\q1
\v 22 A woman, if she maintain her husband, 
\q1 \add Is full of\add* anger, impudency, and much reproach. 
\q1
\v 23 A wicked woman abateth the courage, \add maketh\add* a heavy countenance and a wounded heart: 
\q1 \add A woman\add* that will not comfort her husband in distress \add maketh\add* weak hands and feeble knees. 
\q1
\v 24 Of the woman \add came\add* the beginning of sin, 
\q1 And through her we all die. 
\q1
\v 25 Give the water no passage; 
\q1 Neither a wicked woman liberty to gad abroad. 
\q1
\v 26 If she go not as thou wouldest have \add her\add*, 
\q1 Cut her off from thy flesh, 
\q1 \add And\add* give \add her a bill of divorce\add*, and let \add her\add* go. 
\b
\c  26  
\q1
\v 1 Blessed \add is\add* the man that hath a virtuous wife, 
\q1 For the number of his days \add shall be\add* double. 
\q1
\v 2 A virtuous woman rejoiceth her husband, 
\q1 And he shall fulfil the years of his life in peace. 
\q1
\v 3 A good wife \add is\add* a good portion, 
\q1 \add Which\add* shall be given in the portion of them that fear the Lord. 
\q1
\v 4  \add Whether a man be\add* rich or poor, \add if he have\add* a good heart toward the Lord, 
\q1 He shall at all times rejoice with a cheerful countenance. 
\q1
\v 5  \add There be\add* three \add things that\add* mine heart feareth; 
\q1 And for the fourth I was sore afraid: 
\q1 The slander of a city, the gathering together of an \add unruly\add* multitude, 
\q1 And a false accusation: all \add these are\add* worse than death. 
\q1
\v 6  \add But\add* a grief of heart and sorrow \add is\add* a woman \add that is\add* jealous over \add another\add* woman, 
\q1 And a scourge of the tongue which communicateth with all. 
\q1
\v 7 An evil wife \add is\add* a yoke shaken to and fro: 
\q1 He that hath hold of her \add is\add* as though he held a scorpion. 
\q1
\v 8 A drunken woman and a gadder abroad \add causeth\add* great anger, 
\q1 And she will not cover her own shame. 
\q1
\v 9 The whoredom of a woman may be known in her haughty looks and eyelids. 
\q1
\v 10 If thy daughter be shameless, keep \add her\add* in straitly, 
\q1 Lest she abuse herself through overmuch liberty. 
\q1
\v 11 Watch over an impudent eye: 
\q1 And marvel not if she trespass against thee. 
\q1
\v 12 She will open her mouth, as a thirsty traveller when he hath found a fountain, 
\q1 And drink of every water near \add her:\add* 
\q1 By every hedge will she sit down, 
\q1 And open her quiver against \add every\add* arrow. 
\q1
\v 13 The grace of a wife delighteth her husband, 
\q1 And her discretion will fat his bones. 
\q1
\v 14 A silent and loving woman \add is\add* a gift of the Lord; 
\q1 And there is nothing so much worth as a mind well instructed. 
\q1
\v 15 A shamefast and faithful woman \add is\add* a double grace, 
\q1 And her continent mind cannot be valued. 
\q1
\v 16  \add As\add* the sun when it ariseth in the high heaven; 
\q1 So \add is\add* the beauty of a good wife in the ordering of her house. 
\q1
\v 17  \add As\add* the clear light is upon the holy candlestick; 
\q1 So \add is\add* the beauty of the face in ripe age. 
\q1
\v 18  \add As\add* the golden pillars \add are\add* upon the sockets of silver; 
\q1 So \add are the\add* fair feet with a constant heart. 
\q1
\v 19  \add My\add* son, keep the flower of thine age sound; 
\q1 And give not thy strength to strangers. 
\q1
\v 20 When thou hast gotten a fruitful possession through all the field, 
\q1 Sow \add it with\add* thine own seed, trusting in the goodness of thy stock. 
\q1
\v 21 So thy race which \add thou\add* leavest shall be magnified, 
\q1 Having the confidence of their good descent. 
\q1
\v 22 A harlot shall be accounted as spittle; 
\q1 But a married \add woman\add* is a tower against death to \add her\add* husband. 
\q1
\v 23 A wicked woman is given \add as\add* a portion to a wicked \add man:\add* 
\q1 But a godly \add woman\add* is given to him that feareth the Lord. 
\q1
\v 24 A dishonest woman contemneth shame: 
\q1 But an honest woman will reverence \add her\add* husband. 
\q1
\v 25 A shameless woman shall be counted as a dog; 
\q1 But she that is shamefast will fear the Lord. 
\q1
\v 26 A woman that honoureth her husband shall be judged wise of all; 
\q1 But she that dishonoureth \add him\add* in \add her\add* pride shall be counted ungodly of all. 
\q1
\v 27 A loud crying woman and a scold 
\q1 Shall be sought out to drive away the enemies. 
\q1
\v 28  \add There be\add* two \add things that\add* grieve my heart; 
\q1 And the third maketh me angry: 
\q1 A man of war that suffereth poverty; 
\q1 And men of understanding that are not set by; 
\q1 \add And\add* one that returneth from righteousness to sin; 
\q1 The Lord prepareth such a one for the sword. 
\b
\q1
\v 29 A merchant shall hardly keep himself from doing wrong; 
\q1 And a huckster shall not be freed from sin. 
\c 27  
\q1
\v 1 Many have sinned for a small \add matter;\add* 
\q1 And he that seeketh for abundance will turn his eyes away. 
\q1
\v 2  \add As\add* a nail sticketh fast between the joinings of the stones; 
\q1 So doth sin stick close between buying and selling. 
\q1
\v 3 Unless \add a man\add* hold \add himself\add* diligently in the fear of the Lord, 
\q1 His house shall soon be overthrown. 
\q1
\v 4  \add As\add* when one sifteth with a sieve, the refuse remaineth; 
\q1 So the filth of man in his talk. 
\q1
\v 5 The furnace proveth the potter’s vessels; 
\q1 So the trial of man \add is\add* in his reasoning. 
\q1
\v 6 The fruit declareth if the tree have been dressed; 
\q1 So \add is\add* the utterance of a conceit in the heart of man. 
\q1
\v 7 Praise no man before thou hearest \add him\add* speak; 
\q1 For this \add is\add* the trial of men. 
\q1
\v 8 If thou followest righteousness, thou shalt obtain her, 
\q1 And put her on, as a glorious long robe. 
\q1
\v 9 The birds will resort unto their like; 
\q1 So will truth return unto them that practise in her. 
\q1
\v 10  \add As\add* the lion lieth in wait for the prey; 
\q1 So sin for them that work iniquity. 
\q1
\v 11 The discourse of a godly \add man is\add* always with wisdom; 
\q1 But a fool changeth as the moon. 
\q1
\v 12  \add If thou be\add* among the undiscreet, observe the time; 
\q1 But be continually among men of understanding. 
\q1
\v 13 The discourse of fools \add is\add* irksome, 
\q1 And their sport \add is\add* in the wantonness of sin. 
\q1
\v 14 The talk of him that sweareth much maketh the hair stand upright; 
\q1 And their brawls make \add one\add* stop \add his\add* ears. 
\q1
\v 15 The strife of the proud \add is\add* bloodshedding, 
\q1 And their revilings \add are\add* grievous to the ear. 
\b
\q1
\v 16 Whoso discovereth secrets loseth \add his\add* credit; 
\q1 And shall never find friend to his mind. 
\q1
\v 17 Love \add thy\add* friend, and be faithful unto him: 
\q1 But if thou bewrayest his secrets, follow no more after him. 
\q1
\v 18 For as a man hath destroyed his enemy; 
\q1 So hast thou lost the love of \add thy\add* neighbour. 
\q1
\v 19 As one that letteth a bird go out of his hand, 
\q1 So hast thou let \add thy\add* neighbour go, and shalt not get him \add again\add* 
\q1
\v 20 Follow after him \add no more\add*, for he is \add too\add* far off; 
\q1 He is as a roe escaped out of the snare. 
\q1
\v 21 As for a wound, it may be bound up; 
\q1 And after reviling there may be reconcilement: 
\q1 But he that bewrayeth secrets is without hope. 
\q1
\v 22 He that winketh with the eyes worketh evil: 
\q1 And he that knoweth him will depart from him. 
\q1
\v 23 When thou art present, he will speak sweetly, 
\q1 And will admire thy words: 
\q1 But at the last he will writhe his mouth, 
\q1 And slander thy sayings. 
\q1
\v 24 I have hated many \add things\add*, but nothing like him; 
\q1 For the Lord will hate him. 
\q1
\v 25 Whoso casteth a stone on high casteth \add it\add* on his own head; 
\q1 And a deceitful stroke shall make wounds. 
\q1
\v 26 Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: 
\q1 And he that setteth a trap shall be taken therein. 
\q1
\v 27 He that worketh mischief, it shall fall upon him, 
\q1 And he shall not know whence it cometh. 
\q1
\v 28 Mockery and reproach \add are\add* from the proud; 
\q1 But vengeance, as a lion, shall lie in wait for them. 
\q1
\v 29 They that rejoice at the fall of the righteous shall be taken in the snare; 
\q1 And anguish shall consume them before they die. 
\b
\q1
\v 30 Malice and wrath, even these are abominations; 
\q1 And the sinful man shall have them \add both\add*. 
\c 28  
\q1
\v 1 He that revengeth shall find vengeance from the Lord, 
\q1 And he will surely keep his sins \add in remembrance\add*. 
\q1
\v 2 Forgive thy neighbour the hurt \add that he hath done unto thee\add*, 
\q1 So shall thy sins also be forgiven when thou prayest. 
\q1
\v 3 One man beareth hatred against another, 
\q1 And doth he seek pardon from the Lord? 
\q1
\v 4 He sheweth no mercy to a man, \add which is\add* like himself: 
\q1 And doth he ask \add forgiveness\add* of his own sins? 
\q1
\v 5 If he that is but flesh nourish hatred, 
\q1 Who will intreat for pardon of his sins? 
\q1
\v 6 Remember \add thy\add* end, and let enmity cease; 
\q1 \add Remember\add* corruption and death, and abide in the commandments. 
\q1
\v 7 Remember the commandments, and bear no malice to \add thy\add* neighbour: 
\q1 \add Remember\add* the covenant of the Highest, and wink at ignorance. 
\q1
\v 8 Abstain from strife, and thou shalt diminish \add thy\add* sins: 
\q1 For a furious man will kindle strife. 
\q1
\v 9 A sinful man disquieteth friends, 
\q1 And maketh debate among them that be at peace. 
\q1
\v 10 As the matter of the fire is, so it burneth: 
\q1 \add And\add* as a man’s strength is, \add so\add* is his wrath; 
\q1 And according to his riches his anger riseth; 
\q1 And the stronger they are which contend, \add the more\add* they will be inflamed. 
\q1
\v 11 A hasty contention kindleth a fire: 
\q1 And a hasty fighting sheddeth blood. 
\q1
\v 12 If thou blow the spark, it shall burn: 
\q1 If thou spit upon it, it shall be quenched: 
\q1 And both \add these\add* come out of thy mouth. 
\q1
\v 13 Curse the whisperer and doubletongued: 
\q1 For \add such\add* have destroyed many that were at peace. 
\q1
\v 14 A backbiting tongue hath disquieted many, 
\q1 And driven them from nation to nation: 
\q1 Strong cities hath it pulled down, 
\q1 And overthrown the houses of great men. 
\q1
\v 15 A backbiting tongue hath cast out virtuous women, 
\q1 And deprived them of their labours. 
\q1
\v 16 Whoso hearkeneth unto it shall never find rest, 
\q1 And never dwell quietly. 
\q1
\v 17 The stroke of the whip maketh marks in the flesh: 
\q1 But the stroke of the tongue breaketh the bones. 
\q1
\v 18 Many have fallen by the edge of the sword: 
\q1 But not \add so many\add* as have fallen by the tongue. 
\q1
\v 19 Well \add is\add* he that is defended from it, 
\q1 And hath not passed through the venom thereof; 
\q1 Who hath not drawn the yoke thereof, 
\q1 Nor hath been bound in her bands. 
\q1
\v 20 For the yoke thereof \add is\add* a yoke of iron, 
\q1 And the bands thereof \add are\add* bands of brass. 
\q1
\v 21 The death thereof \add is\add* an evil death, 
\q1 The grave \add were\add* better than it. 
\q1
\v 22 It shall not have rule over them that fear God, 
\q1 Neither shall they be burnt with the flame thereof. 
\q1
\v 23 Such as forsake the Lord shall fall into it; 
\q1 And it shall burn in them, and not be quenched; 
\q1 It shall be sent upon them as a lion, 
\q1 And devour them as a leopard. 
\q1
\v 24 Look \add that\add* thou hedge thy possession about with thorns, 
\q1 \add And\add* bind up thy silver and gold, 
\q1
\v 25 And weigh thy words in a balance, 
\q1 And make a door and bar for thy mouth. 
\q1
\v 26 Beware thou slide not by it, 
\q1 Lest thou fall before him that lieth in wait. 
\b
\c  29  
\q1
\v 1 He that is merciful will lend unto \add his\add* neighbour; 
\q1 And he that strengtheneth his hand keepeth the commandments. 
\q1
\v 2 Lend to \add thy\add* neighbour in time of his need, 
\q1 And pay thou \add thy\add* neighbour again in due season. 
\q1
\v 3 Keep thy word, and deal faithfully with him, 
\q1 And thou shalt always find the thing that is necessary for thee. 
\q1
\v 4 Many, when a thing was lent \add them\add*, reckoned \add it\add* to be found, 
\q1 And put them to trouble that helped them. 
\q1
\v 5 Till he hath received, he will kiss a man’s hand; 
\q1 And for \add his\add* neighbour’s money he will speak submissly: 
\q1 But when \add he\add* should repay, he will prolong the time, 
\q1 And return words of grief, 
\q1 And complain of the time. 
\q1
\v 6 If he prevail, he shall hardly receive the half, 
\q1 And he will count as if he had found it: 
\q1 If not, he hath deprived him of his money, 
\q1 And he hath gotten him an enemy without cause: 
\q1 He payeth him with cursings and railings; 
\q1 And for honour he will pay him disgrace. 
\q1
\v 7 Many therefore have refused \add to lend\add* for \add other men’s\add* ill dealing, 
\q1 Fearing to be defrauded. 
\q1
\v 8 Yet have thou patience with a \add man\add* in poor estate, 
\q1 And delay not to shew him mercy. 
\q1
\v 9 Help the poor for the commandment’s sake, 
\q1 And turn him not away because of his poverty. 
\q1
\v 10 Lose \add thy\add* money for \add thy\add* brother and \add thy\add* friend, 
\q1 And let it not rust under a stone to be lost. 
\q1
\v 11 Lay up thy treasure according to the commandments of the most High, 
\q1 And it shall bring thee more profit than gold. 
\q1
\v 12 Shut up alms in thy storehouses: 
\q1 And it shall deliver thee from all affliction. 
\q1
\v 13 It shall fight for thee against \add thine\add* enemies 
\q1 Better than a mighty shield and strong spear. 
\q1
\v 14 An honest man is surety for \add his\add* neighbour: 
\q1 But he that is impudent will forsake him. 
\q1
\v 15 Forget not the friendship of \add thy\add* surety, 
\q1 For he hath given his life for thee. 
\q1
\v 16 A sinner will overthrow the good \add estate\add* of \add his\add* surety: 
\q1
\v 17 And he that is of an unthankful mind will leave him \add in danger\add* that delivered \add him\add*. 
\q1
\v 18 Suretiship hath undone many of good estate, 
\q1 And shaked them as a wave of the sea: 
\q1 Mighty men hath it driven from their houses, 
\q1 So that they wandered among strange nations. 
\q1
\v 19 A wicked \add man\add* transgressing the commandments of the Lord shall fall into suretiship: 
\q1 And he that \add undertaketh and\add* followeth other men’s business for gain shall fall into suits. 
\q1
\v 20 Help \add thy\add* neighbour according to thy power, 
\q1 And beware that thou thyself fall not \add into the same\add*. 
\q1
\v 21 The chief thing for life \add is\add* water, and bread, 
\q1 And clothing, and a house to cover shame. 
\q1
\v 22 Better \add is\add* the life of a poor \add man\add* in a mean cottage, 
\q1 Than delicate fare in another man’s \add house\add*. 
\q1
\v 23 Be it little or much, hold thee contented, 
\q1 That thou hear not the reproach of thy house. 
\q1
\v 24  \add For it is\add* a miserable life \add to go\add* from house to house: 
\q1 For where thou art a stranger, thou darest not open thy mouth. 
\q1
\v 25 Thou shalt entertain, and feast, and have no thanks: 
\q1 Moreover, thou shalt hear bitter \add words:\add* 
\q1
\v 26 Come, \add thou\add* stranger, \add and\add* furnish a table, 
\q1 And feed me \add of\add* that thou hast ready. 
\q1
\v 27 Give place, \add thou\add* stranger, to an honourable \add man;\add* 
\q1 My brother cometh to be lodged, \add and I have\add* need of \add mine\add* house. 
\q1
\v 28 These \add things are\add* grievous to a man of understanding; 
\q1 The upbraiding of houseroom, and reproaching of the lender. 
\b
\c  30  
\q1
\v 1 He that loveth his son causeth him oft to feel the rod, 
\q1 That he may have joy of him in the end. 
\q1
\v 2 He that chastiseth his son shall have joy in him, 
\q1 And shall rejoice of him among \add his\add* acquaintance. 
\q1
\v 3 He that teacheth his son grieveth the enemy: 
\q1 And before \add his\add* friends he shall rejoice of him. 
\q1
\v 4 Though his father die, yet \add he is\add* as though he were not dead: 
\q1 For he hath left \add one\add* behind him \add that is\add* like himself. 
\q1
\v 5 While he lived, he saw and rejoiced in him: 
\q1 And when he died, he was not sorrowful. 
\q1
\v 6 He left behind him an avenger against \add his\add* enemies, 
\q1 And one that shall requite kindness to \add his\add* friends. 
\q1
\v 7 He that maketh too much of \add his\add* son shall bind up his wounds; 
\q1 And his bowels will be troubled at every cry. 
\q1
\v 8 A horse not broken becometh headstrong: 
\q1 And a child left to himself will be wilful. 
\q1
\v 9 Cocker \add thy\add* child, and he shall make thee afraid: 
\q1 Play with him, and he will bring thee to heaviness. 
\q1
\v 10 Laugh not with him, lest thou have sorrow with \add him\add*, 
\q1 And \add lest\add* thou gnash thy teeth in the end. 
\q1
\v 11 Give him no liberty in \add his\add* youth, 
\q1 And wink not at his follies. 
\q1
\v 12 Bow down his neck while \add he is\add* young, 
\q1 And beat him on the sides while he is a child, 
\q1 Lest he wax stubborn, and be disobedient unto thee, 
\q1 And \add so\add* bring sorrow to thine heart. 
\q1
\v 13 Chastise thy son, and hold him to labour, 
\q1 Lest his lewd behaviour be an offence unto thee. 
\b
\q1
\v 14 Better \add is\add* the poor, \add being\add* sound and strong of constitution, 
\q1 Than a rich \add man\add* that is afflicted in his body. 
\q1
\v 15 Health and good state of body \add are\add* above all gold, 
\q1 And a strong body above infinite wealth. 
\q1
\v 16 There is no riches above a sound body, 
\q1 And no joy above the joy of the heart. 
\q1
\v 17 Death \add is\add* better than a bitter life 
\q1 Or continual sickness. 
\q1
\v 18 Delicates poured upon a mouth shut up 
\q1 \add Are as\add* messes of meat set upon a grave. 
\q1
\v 19 What good doth the offering unto an idol? 
\q1 For neither can it eat nor smell: 
\q1 So \add is\add* he that is persecuted of the Lord. 
\q1
\v 20 He seeth with \add his\add* eyes and groaneth, 
\q1 As an eunuch that embraceth a virgin and sigheth. 
\q1
\v 21 Give not over thy mind to heaviness, 
\q1 And afflict not thyself in thine own counsel. 
\q1
\v 22 The gladness of the heart \add is\add* the life of man, 
\q1 And the joyfulness of a man prolongeth his days. 
\q1
\v 23 Love thine own soul, 
\q1 And comfort thy heart, 
\q1 Remove sorrow far from thee: 
\q1 For sorrow hath killed many, 
\q1 And there is no profit therein. 
\q1
\v 24 Envy and wrath shorten the life, 
\q1 And carefulness bringeth age before the time. 
\q1
\v 25 A cheerful and good heart will have a care of his meat \add and\add* diet. 
\b
\c  31  
\q1
\v 1 Watching for riches consumeth the flesh, 
\q1 And the care thereof driveth away sleep. 
\q1
\v 2 Watching care will not let \add a man\add* slumber, 
\q1 As a sore disease breaketh sleep. 
\q1
\v 3 The rich hath great labour in gathering riches together; 
\q1 And when \add he\add* resteth, he is filled with his delicates. 
\q1
\v 4 The poor laboureth in \add his\add* poor estate; 
\q1 And when he leaveth off, he is \add still\add* needy. 
\q1
\v 5 He that loveth gold shall not be justified, 
\q1 And he that followeth corruption shall have enough \add thereof\add*. 
\q1
\v 6 Gold hath been the ruin of many, 
\q1 And their destruction was present. 
\q1
\v 7 It is a stumblingblock unto them that sacrifice unto it, 
\q1 And every fool shall be taken therewith. 
\q1
\v 8 Blessed \add is\add* the rich that is found without blemish, 
\q1 And hath not gone after gold. 
\q1
\v 9 Who is he? and we will call him blessed: 
\q1 For wonderful \add things\add* hath he done among his people. 
\q1
\v 10 Who hath been tried thereby, and found perfect? 
\q1 Then let \add him\add* glory. 
\q1 Who might offend, and hath not offended? 
\q1 Or done evil, and hath not done \add it?\add* 
\q1
\v 11 His goods shall be established, 
\q1 And the congregation shall declare his alms. 
\b
\q1
\v 12 If thou sit at a bountiful table, 
\q1 Be not greedy upon it, 
\q1 And say not, \add There is\add* much \add meat\add* on it. 
\q1
\v 13 Remember that a wicked eye \add is\add* an evil \add thing:\add* 
\q1 \add And\add* what is created more wicked than an eye? 
\q1 Therefore it weepeth upon every occasion. 
\q1
\v 14 Stretch not thine hand whithersoever it looketh, 
\q1 And thrust \add it\add* not with him into the dish. 
\q1
\v 15 Judge of \add thy\add* neighbour by thyself: 
\q1 And be discreet in every point. 
\q1
\v 16 Eat, as \add it becometh\add* a man, those \add things\add* which are set before thee; 
\q1 And devour not, lest thou be hated. 
\q1
\v 17 Leave off first for manners’ sake; 
\q1 And be not unsatiable, lest thou offend. 
\q1
\v 18 When thou sittest among many, 
\q1 Reach not thine hand out first of all. 
\q1
\v 19 A very little \add is\add* sufficient for a man well nurtured, 
\q1 And he fetcheth not his wind short upon his bed. 
\q1
\v 20 Sound sleep \add cometh\add* of moderate eating: 
\q1 He riseth early, and his wits \add are\add* with him: 
\q1 \add But\add* the pain of watching, and choler, and pangs of the belly, \add are\add* with an unsatiable man. 
\q1
\v 21 And if thou hast been forced to eat, 
\q1 Arise, go forth, vomit, and thou shalt have rest. 
\q1
\v 22  \add My\add* son, hear me, and despise me not, 
\q1 And at the last thou shalt find as I told thee: 
\q1 In all thy works be quick, 
\q1 So shall there no sickness come unto thee. 
\q1
\v 23  \add Whoso is\add* liberal of \add his\add* meat, men shall speak well of him; 
\q1 And the report of his good housekeeping \add will be\add* believed. 
\q1
\v 24  \add But\add* against \add him that is\add* a niggard of \add his\add* meat the \add whole\add* city shall murmur; 
\q1 And the testimonies of his niggardness \add shall\add* not \add be\add* doubted of. 
\b
\q1
\v 25 Shew not thy valiantness in wine; 
\q1 For wine hath destroyed many. 
\q1
\v 26 The furnace proveth the edge by dipping: 
\q1 So doth wine the hearts of the proud by drunkeness. 
\q1
\v 27 Wine \add is\add* as good as life to a man, if it be drunk moderately: 
\q1 What life \add is then\add* to \add a man\add* that is without wine? 
\q1 For it was made to make men glad. 
\q1
\v 28 Wine measurably drunk \add and\add* in season 
\q1 \add Bringeth\add* gladness of the heart, and cheerfulness of the mind: 
\q1
\v 29  \add But\add* wine drunken with excess \add maketh\add* bitterness of the mind, 
\q1 With brawling and quarrelling. 
\q1
\v 30 Drunkenness increaseth the rage of a fool till \add he\add* offend: 
\q1 It diminisheth strength, and maketh wounds. 
\q1
\v 31 Rebuke not \add thy\add* neighbour at the wine, 
\q1 And despise him not in his mirth: 
\q1 Give him no despiteful words, 
\q1 And press not upon him with urging him \add to drink\add*. 
\c 32  
\q1
\v 1 If thou be made the master \add of the feast\add*, lift not thyself up, 
\q1 \add But\add* be among them as one of the rest; 
\q1 Take diligent care for them, and so sit down. 
\q1
\v 2 And when thou hast done all thy office, take thy place, 
\q1 That thou mayest be merry with them, 
\q1 And receive a crown for \add thy\add* well ordering \add of the feast\add*. 
\q1
\v 3 Speak, \add thou that art\add* the elder, for it becometh thee, but with sound judgment; 
\q1 And hinder not musick. 
\q1
\v 4 Pour not out words where \add there is\add* a musician, 
\q1 And shew not forth wisdom out of time. 
\q1
\v 5 A concert of musick in a banquet of wine 
\q1 \add Is as\add* a signet of carbuncle set in gold. 
\q1
\v 6 As a signet of an emerald set in a work of gold, 
\q1 \add So is\add* the melody of musick with pleasant wine. 
\q1
\v 7 Speak, young man, if \add there be\add* need of thee: 
\q1 \add And yet\add* scarcely when thou art twice asked. 
\q1
\v 8 Let thy speech be short, \add comprehending\add* much in few \add words;\add* 
\q1 Be as one that knoweth and yet holdeth his tongue. 
\q1
\v 9 If thou be among great men, make not thyself equal \add with them;\add* 
\q1 And when ancient men \add are in place\add*, use not many words. 
\q1
\v 10 Before the thunder goeth lightning; 
\q1 And before a shamefast \add man\add* shall go favour. 
\q1
\v 11 Rise up betimes, and be not the last; 
\q1 \add But\add* get thee home without delay. 
\q1
\v 12 There take thy pastime, and do what thou wilt: 
\q1 But sin not by proud speech. 
\q1
\v 13 And for these \add things\add* bless him that made thee, 
\q1 And hath replenished thee with his good \add things\add*. 
\b
\q1
\v 14 Whoso feareth the Lord will receive his discipline; 
\q1 And they that seek \add him\add* early shall find favour. 
\q1
\v 15 He that seeketh the law shall be filled therewith: 
\q1 But the hypocrite will be offended thereat. 
\q1
\v 16 They that fear the Lord shall find judgment, 
\q1 And shall kindle justice as a light. 
\q1
\v 17 A sinful man will not be reproved, 
\q1 But findeth an excuse according to his will. 
\q1
\v 18 A man of counsel will be considerate; 
\q1 But a strange and proud \add man\add* is not daunted with fear, 
\q1 Even when of himself he hath done without counsel. 
\q1
\v 19 Do nothing without advice; 
\q1 And when thou hast once done, repent not. 
\q1
\v 20 Go not in a way wherein \add thou\add* mayest fall, 
\q1 And stumble not among the stones. 
\q1
\v 21 Be not confident in a plain way. 
\q1
\v 22 And beware of thine own children. 
\q1
\v 23 In every good work trust thy own soul; 
\q1 For this is the keeping of the commandments. 
\q1
\v 24 He that believeth in the Lord taketh heed to the commandment; 
\q1 And he that trusteth in him shall fare never the worse. 
\c 33  
\q1
\v 1 There shall no evil happen unto him that feareth the Lord; 
\q1 But in temptation even again he will deliver him. 
\q1
\v 2 A wise man hateth not the law; 
\q1 But he that is a hypocrite therein \add is\add* as a ship in a storm. 
\q1
\v 3 A man of understanding trusteth in the law; 
\q1 And the law \add is\add* faithful unto him, as an oracle. 
\q1
\v 4 Prepare what to say, and so thou shalt be heard: 
\q1 \add And\add* bind up instruction, and then make answer. 
\q1
\v 5 The heart of the foolish \add is like\add* a cartwheel; 
\q1 And his thoughts \add are\add* like a rolling axletree. 
\q1
\v 6 A stallion horse \add is\add* as a mocking friend, 
\q1 He neigheth under every one that sitteth upon \add him\add*. 
\b
\q1
\v 7 Why doth one day excel another, 
\q1 When as all the light of \add every\add* day in the year \add is\add* of the sun? 
\q1
\v 8 By the knowledge of the Lord they were distinguished: 
\q1 And he altered seasons and feasts. 
\q1
\v 9  \add Some\add* of them hath he made high days, and hallowed \add them\add*, 
\q1 And \add some\add* of them hath he made ordinary days. 
\q1
\v 10 And all men \add are\add* from the ground, 
\q1 And Adam was created of earth. 
\q1
\v 11 In much knowledge the Lord hath divided them, 
\q1 And made their ways diverse. 
\q1
\v 12  \add Some\add* of them hath he blessed and exalted, 
\q1 And \add some\add* of them hath he sanctified, and set near himself: 
\q1 \add But some\add* of them hath he cursed and brought low, 
\q1 And turned out of their places. 
\q1
\v 13 As the clay \add is\add* in the potter’s hand, 
\q1 To fashion it at his pleasure: 
\q1 So man \add is\add* in the hand of him that made him, 
\q1 To render to them as liketh him best. 
\q1
\v 14 Good \add is set\add* against evil, 
\q1 And life against death: 
\q1 So \add is\add* the godly against the sinner, 
\q1 And the sinner against the godly. 
\q1
\v 15 So look upon all the works of the most High; 
\q1 \add And there are\add* two \add and\add* two, one against another. 
\q1
\v 16 I awaked up last \add of all\add*, 
\q1 As one that gathereth after the grapegatherers: 
\q1 By the blessing of the Lord I profited, 
\q1 And filled \add my\add* winepress like a gatherer of grapes. 
\q1
\v 17 Consider that I laboured not for myself only, 
\q1 But for all them that seek learning. 
\b
\q1
\v 18 Hear me, O \add ye\add* great men of the people, 
\q1 And hearken with your ears, ye rulers of the congregation. 
\q1
\v 19 Give not \add thy\add* son and wife, \add thy\add* brother and friend, power over thee while thou livest, 
\q1 And give not thy goods to another: 
\q1 Lest it repent thee, and thou intreat for the same \add again\add*. 
\q1
\v 20 As long as thou livest and hast breath in thee, 
\q1 Give not thyself over to any. 
\q1
\v 21 For better it is that \add thy\add* children should seek to thee, 
\q1 Than that thou shouldest stand to their courtesy. 
\q1
\v 22 In all thy works keep to thyself the pre-eminence; 
\q1 Leave not a stain in thine honour. 
\q1
\v 23 At the time when thou shalt end thy days, 
\q1 And finish \add thy\add* life, distribute \add thine\add* inheritance. 
\b
\q1
\v 24 Fodder, a wand, and burdens, \add are\add* for the ass; 
\q1 \add And\add* bread, correction, and work, for a servant. 
\q1
\v 25 If thou set thy servant to labour, thou shalt find rest: 
\q1 \add But\add* if thou let him go idle, he shall seek liberty. 
\q1
\v 26 A yoke and a collar do bow the neck: 
\q1 So \add are\add* tortures and torments for an evil servant. 
\q1
\v 27 Send him to labour, that he be not idle; 
\q1 For idleness teacheth much evil. 
\q1
\v 28 Set \add him\add* to work, as is fit for him: 
\q1 If he be not obedient, put on more heavy fetters. 
\q1
\v 29 But be not excessive toward any; 
\q1 And without discretion do nothing. 
\q1
\v 30 If thou have a servant, let him be unto thee as thyself, 
\q1 Because thou hast bought him with a price. 
\q1
\v 31 If thou have a servant, entreat him as a brother: 
\q1 For thou hast need of him, as \add of\add* thine own soul: 
\q1 If thou entreat him evil, and he run from \add thee\add*, 
\q1 Which way wilt thou \add go to\add* seek him? 
\b
\c  34  
\q1
\v 1 The hopes of a man void of understanding \add are\add* vain and false: 
\q1 And dreams lift up fools. 
\q1
\v 2 Whoso regardeth dreams 
\q1 \add Is\add* like him that catcheth at a shadow, 
\q1 And followeth after the wind. 
\q1
\v 3 The vision of dreams \add is\add* the resemblance of one \add thing\add* to another, 
\q1 \add Even as\add* the likeness of a face to a face. 
\q1
\v 4 Of an unclean \add thing\add* what can be cleansed? 
\q1 And from \add that thing which is\add* false what truth can come? 
\q1
\v 5 Divinations, and soothsayings, and dreams, are vain: 
\q1 And the heart fancieth, as a woman’s \add heart\add* in travail. 
\q1
\v 6 If they be not sent from the most High in thy visitation, 
\q1 Set not thy heart upon them. 
\q1
\v 7 For dreams have deceived many, 
\q1 And they have failed that put their trust in them. 
\q1
\v 8 The law shall be found perfect without lies: 
\q1 And wisdom \add is\add* perfection to a faithful mouth. 
\b
\q1
\v 9 A man that hath travelled knoweth many \add things;\add* 
\q1 And he that hath much experience will declare wisdom. 
\q1
\v 10 He that hath no experience knoweth little: 
\q1 But he that hath travelled is full of prudence. 
\q1
\v 11 When I travelled, I saw many \add things;\add* 
\q1 And I understand more than I can express. 
\q1
\v 12 I was ofttimes in danger of death: 
\q1 Yet I was delivered because of these \add things\add*. 
\q1
\v 13 The spirit of those that fear the Lord shall live; 
\q1 For their hope \add is\add* in him that saveth them. 
\q1
\v 14 Whoso feareth the Lord shall not fear 
\q1 Nor be afraid; for he \add is\add* his hope. 
\q1
\v 15 Blessed \add is\add* the soul of him that feareth the Lord: 
\q1 To whom doth he look? 
\q1 And who \add is\add* his strength? 
\q1
\v 16  \add For\add* the eyes of the Lord \add are\add* upon them that love him, 
\q1 \add He is their\add* mighty protection and strong stay, 
\q1 A defence from heat, and a cover from the \add sun at\add* noon, 
\q1 A preservation from stumbling, and a help from falling. 
\q1
\v 17 He raiseth up the soul, and lighteneth the eyes: 
\q1 He giveth health, life, and blessing. 
\b
\q1
\v 18 He that sacrificeth of a \add thing\add* wrongfully gotten, \add his\add* offering \add is\add* ridiculous; 
\q1 And the gifts of unjust \add men are\add* not accepted. 
\q1
\v 19 The most High is not pleased with the offerings of the wicked; 
\q1 Neither is he pacified for sin by the multitude of sacrifices. 
\q1
\v 20 Whoso bringeth an offering of the goods of the poor 
\q1 \add Doeth as\add* one that killeth the son before his father’s eyes. 
\q1
\v 21 The bread of the needy \add is\add* their life: 
\q1 He that defraudeth \add him\add* thereof \add is\add* a man of blood. 
\q1
\v 22 He that taketh away \add his\add* neighbour’s living slayeth \add him;\add* 
\q1 And he that defraudeth the labourer of his hire \add is\add* a bloodshedder. 
\q1
\v 23 When one buildeth, and another pulleth down, 
\q1 What profit have they \add then\add* but labour? 
\q1
\v 24 When one prayeth, and another curseth, 
\q1 Whose voice will the Lord hear? 
\q1
\v 25 He that washeth himself after \add the touching of\add* a dead body, if he touch it again, 
\q1 What availeth his washing? 
\q1
\v 26 So \add is it with\add* a man that fasteth for his sins, 
\q1 And goeth again, and doeth the same: 
\q1 Who will hear his prayer? 
\q1 Or what doth his humbling profit him? 
\b
\c  35  
\q1
\v 1 He that keepeth the law bringeth offerings enough: 
\q1 He that taketh heed to the commandment offereth a peace offering. 
\q1
\v 2 He that requiteth a good turn offereth fine flour; 
\q1 And he that giveth alms sacrificeth praise. 
\q1
\v 3 To depart from wickedness \add is\add* a thing pleasing to the Lord; 
\q1 And to forsake unrighteousness \add is\add* a propitiation. 
\q1
\v 4 Thou shalt not appear empty before the Lord. 
\q1
\v 5 For all these \add things are to be done\add* because of the commandment. 
\q1
\v 6 The offering of the righteous maketh the altar fat, 
\q1 And the sweet savour thereof \add is\add* before the most High. 
\q1
\v 7 The sacrifice of a just man \add is\add* acceptable, 
\q1 And the memorial thereof shall never be forgotten. 
\q1
\v 8 Give the Lord his honour with a good eye, 
\q1 And diminish not the firstfruits of thine hands. 
\q1
\v 9 In all \add thy\add* gifts shew a cheerful countenance, 
\q1 And dedicate \add thy\add* tithes with gladness. 
\q1
\v 10 Give unto the most High according as he hath enriched \add thee;\add* 
\q1 And as \add thou\add* hast gotten, \add give\add* with a cheerful eye. 
\q1
\v 11 For the Lord recompenseth, 
\q1 And will give thee seven times as much. 
\q1
\v 12 Do not \add think to\add* corrupt with gifts; for \add such\add* he will not receive: 
\q1 And trust not to unrighteous sacrifices; 
\q1 For the Lord is judge, 
\q1 And with him is no respect of persons. 
\q1
\v 13 He will not accept \add any\add* person against a poor \add man\add*, 
\q1 But will hear the prayer of the oppressed. 
\q1
\v 14 He will not despise the supplication of the fatherless; 
\q1 Nor the widow, when she poureth out \add her\add* complaint. 
\q1
\v 15 Do not the tears run down the widow’s cheeks? 
\q1 And \add is not\add* her cry against him that causeth them to fall? 
\q1
\v 16 He that serveth \add the Lord\add* shall be accepted with favour, 
\q1 And his prayer shall reach unto the clouds. 
\q1
\v 17 The prayer of the humble pierceth the clouds: 
\q1 And till it come nigh, he will not be comforted; 
\q1 And will not depart, till the most High shall behold 
\q1 To judge righteously, and execute judgment. 
\q1
\v 18 For the Lord will not be slack, 
\q1 Neither will the Mighty be patient towards them, 
\q1 Till he have smitten in sunder the loins of the unmerciful, 
\q1 And repaid vengeance to the heathen; 
\q1 Till he have taken away the multitude of the proud, 
\q1 And broken the sceptre of the unrighteous; 
\q1
\v 19 Till he have rendered to \add every\add* man according to his deeds, 
\q1 And \add to\add* the works of men according to their devices; 
\q1 Till he have judged the cause of his people, 
\q1 And made them to rejoice in his mercy. 
\q1
\v 20 Mercy is seasonable in the time of affliction, 
\q1 As clouds of rain in the time of drought. 
\b
\c  36  
\q1
\v 1 Have mercy upon us, O Lord God of all, and behold \add us:\add* 
\q1
\v 2 And send thy fear upon all the nations that seek not after thee. 
\q1
\v 3 Lift up thy hand against the strange nations, 
\q1 And let them see thy power. 
\q1
\v 4 As thou wast sanctified in us before them: 
\q1 So be thou magnified among them before us. 
\q1
\v 5 And let them know thee, as we have known thee, 
\q1 That there is no God but \add only\add* thou, O God. 
\q1
\v 6 Shew new signs, and make other strange wonders: 
\q1 Glorify \add thy\add* hand and \add thy\add* right arm, 
\q1 That they may set forth thy wondrous works. 
\q1
\v 7 Raise up indignation, and pour out wrath: 
\q1 Take away the adversary, and destroy the enemy. 
\q1
\v 8 Make the time short, remember the covenant, 
\q1 And let them declare thy wonderful works. 
\q1
\v 9 Let him that escapeth be consumed by the rage of the fire; 
\q1 And let them perish that oppress the people. 
\q1
\v 10 Smite in sunder the heads of the rulers of the heathen, 
\q1 That say, There is none \add other\add* but we. 
\q1
\v 11 Gather all the tribes of Jacob together, 
\q1 And inherit thou them, as from the beginning. 
\q1
\v 12 O Lord, have mercy upon the people that is called by thy name, 
\q1 And \add upon\add* Israel, whom thou hast named \add thy\add* firstborn. 
\q1
\v 13 O be merciful unto Jerusalem, thy holy city, 
\q1 The place of thy rest. 
\q1
\v 14 Fill Sion with thine unspeakable oracles, 
\q1 And thy people with thy glory. 
\q1
\v 15 Give testimony unto those that thou hast possessed from the beginning, 
\q1 And raise up prophets that \add have been\add* in thy name. 
\q1
\v 16 Reward them that wait for thee, 
\q1 And let thy prophets be found faithful. 
\q1
\v 17 O Lord, hear the prayer of thy servants, 
\q1 According to the blessing of Aaron over thy people, 
\q1 That all they which \add dwell\add* upon the earth may know 
\q1 That thou art the Lord, the eternal God. 
\q1
\v 18 The belly devoureth all meats, 
\q1 Yet is one meat better than another. 
\q1
\v 19  \add As\add* the palate tasteth \add divers\add* kinds of venison: 
\q1 So \add doth\add* a heart of understanding false speeches. 
\q1
\v 20 A froward heart causeth heaviness: 
\q1 But a man of experience will recompense him. 
\q1
\v 21 A woman will receive every man, 
\q1 Yet is one daughter better than another. 
\q1
\v 22 The beauty of a woman cheereth the countenance, 
\q1 And a man loveth nothing better. 
\q1
\v 23 If there be kindness, meekness, and comfort, in her tongue, 
\q1 \add Then\add* is not her husband like other men. 
\q1
\v 24 He that getteth a wife beginneth a possession, 
\q1 A help like unto himself, and a pillar of rest. 
\q1
\v 25 Where no hedge is, \add there\add* the possession is spoiled: 
\q1 And he that hath no wife will wander up and down mourning. 
\q1
\v 26 Who will trust a thief well appointed, 
\q1 That skippeth from city to city? 
\q1 So \add who will believe\add* a man that hath no house, 
\q1 And lodgeth wheresoever the night taketh him? 
\b
\c  37  
\q1
\v 1 Every friend saith, I am his friend also: 
\q1 But there is a friend, \add which is\add* only a friend in name. 
\q1
\v 2 Is it not a grief unto death, 
\q1 When a companion and friend is turned to an enemy? 
\q1
\v 3 O wicked imagination, whence camest thou in 
\q1 To cover the earth with deceit? 
\q1
\v 4  \add There is\add* a companion, \add which\add* rejoiceth in the prosperity of a friend, 
\q1 But in the time of trouble will be against \add him\add*. 
\q1
\v 5  \add There is\add* a companion, \add which\add* helpeth his friend for the belly, 
\q1 And taketh up the buckler against the enemy. 
\q1
\v 6 Forget not thy friend in thy mind, 
\q1 And be not unmindful of him in thy riches. 
\q1
\v 7 Every counseller extolleth counsel; 
\q1 But there is some that counselleth for himself. 
\q1
\v 8 Beware of a counseller, 
\q1 And know before what need he \add hath;\add* 
\q1 (For he will counsel for himself) 
\q1 Lest he cast the lot upon thee, 
\q1
\v 9 And say unto thee, Thy way \add is\add* good: 
\q1 And \add afterward\add* he stand on the other \add side\add*, to see what shall befall thee. 
\q1
\v 10 Consult not with one that suspecteth thee: 
\q1 And hide \add thy\add* counsel from such as envy thee. 
\q1
\v 11  \add Neither consult\add* with a woman touching her of whom she is jealous; 
\q1 Neither with a coward in matters of war; 
\q1 \add Nor\add* with a merchant concerning exchange; 
\q1 Nor with a buyer of selling; 
\q1 \add Nor\add* with an envious man of thankfulness; 
\q1 Nor with an unmerciful man touching kindness; 
\q1 \add Nor\add* with the slothful for any work; 
\q1 Nor with a hireling for a year, of finishing \add work;\add* 
\q1 \add Nor\add* with an idle servant of much business: 
\q1 Hearken not unto these in any matter of counsel. 
\q1
\v 12 But be continually with a godly man, 
\q1 Whom thou knowest to keep the commandments of the Lord, 
\q1 Whose mind \add is\add* according to thy mind, 
\q1 And will sorrow with thee, if thou shalt miscarry. 
\q1
\v 13 And let the counsel of \add thine own\add* heart stand: 
\q1 For there is no \add man\add* more faithful unto thee than it. 
\q1
\v 14 For a man’s mind is sometime wont to tell \add him more\add* 
\q1 Than seven watchmen, that sit above in a high tower. 
\q1
\v 15 And above all this pray to the most High, 
\q1 That he will direct thy way in truth. 
\q1
\v 16  \add Let\add* reason \add go\add* before every enterprise, 
\q1 And counsel before every action. 
\b
\q1
\v 17 The countenance \add is\add* a sign of changing of the heart. 
\q1
\v 18 Four manner \add of things\add* appear: good and evil, life and death: 
\q1 But the tongue ruleth over them continually. 
\q1
\v 19 There is one \add that is\add* wise and teacheth many, 
\q1 And \add yet\add* is unprofitable to himself. 
\q1
\v 20 There is one that sheweth wisdom in words, \add and is\add* hated: 
\q1 He shall be destitute of all food. 
\q1
\v 21 For grace is not given him from the Lord; 
\q1 Because he is deprived of all wisdom. 
\q1
\v 22  \add Another\add* is wise to himself; 
\q1 And the fruits of understanding \add are\add* commendable in his mouth. 
\q1
\v 23 A wise man instructeth his people; 
\q1 And the fruits of his understanding fail not. 
\q1
\v 24 A wise man shall be filled with blessing; 
\q1 And all they that see \add him\add* shall count him happy. 
\q1
\v 25 The days of the life of man \add may be\add* numbered: 
\q1 But the days of Israel \add are\add* innumerable. 
\q1
\v 26 A wise \add man\add* shall inherit glory among his people, 
\q1 And his name shall be perpetual. 
\b
\q1
\v 27  \add My\add* son, prove thy soul in thy life, 
\q1 And see what \add is\add* evil for it, 
\q1 And give not \add that\add* unto it. 
\q1
\v 28 For all \add things\add* are not profitable for all \add men\add*, 
\q1 Neither hath every soul pleasure in every \add thing\add*. 
\q1
\v 29 Be not unsatiable in any dainty thing, 
\q1 Nor too greedy upon meats: 
\q1
\v 30 For excess of meats bringeth sickness, 
\q1 And surfeiting will turn into choler. 
\q1
\v 31 By surfeiting have many perished; 
\q1 But he that taketh heed prolongeth \add his\add* life. 
\b
\c  38  
\q1
\v 1 Honour a physician with the honour due unto him for the uses \add which you may have\add* of him: 
\q1 For the Lord hath created him. 
\q1
\v 2 For of the most High cometh healing, 
\q1 And he shall receive honour of the king. 
\q1
\v 3 The skill of the physician shall lift up his head: 
\q1 And in the sight of great men he shall be in admiration. 
\q1
\v 4 The Lord hath created medicines out of the earth; 
\q1 And he that is wise will not abhor them. 
\q1
\v 5 Was not the water made sweet with wood, 
\q1 That the virtue thereof might be known? 
\q1
\v 6 And he hath given men skill, 
\q1 That \add he\add* might be honoured in his marvellous works. 
\q1
\v 7 With such doth he heal \add men\add*, 
\q1 And taketh away their pains. 
\q1
\v 8 Of such doth the apothecary make a confection; 
\q1 And of his works there is no end; 
\q1 And from him is peace over all the earth. 
\q1
\v 9  \add My\add* son, in thy sickness be not negligent: 
\q1 But pray unto the Lord, and he will make thee whole. 
\q1
\v 10 Leave off from sin, and order \add thine\add* hands aright, 
\q1 And cleanse \add thy\add* heart from all wickedness. 
\q1
\v 11 Give a sweet savour, and a memorial of fine flour; 
\q1 And make a fat offering, as not being. 
\q1
\v 12 Then give place to the physician, for the Lord hath created him: 
\q1 Let him not go from thee, for \add thou hast\add* need of him. 
\q1
\v 13 There is a time when in their hands \add there is\add* good success. 
\q1
\v 14 For they shall also pray unto the Lord, that he would prosper 
\q1 That, which they give for ease and remedy to prolong life. 
\q1
\v 15 He that sinneth before his Maker, 
\q1 Let him fall into the hand of the physician. 
\b
\q1
\v 16  \add My\add* son, let tears fall down over the dead, 
\q1 And begin to lament, as if thou hadst suffered great harm \add thyself;\add* 
\q1 And \add then\add* cover his body according to the custom, 
\q1 And neglect not his burial. 
\q1
\v 17 Weep bitterly, and make great moan, 
\q1 And use lamentation, as he is worthy, 
\q1 \add And that\add* a day or two, lest \add thou\add* be evil spoken of: 
\q1 And \add then\add* comfort thyself for \add thy\add* heaviness. 
\q1
\v 18 For of heaviness cometh death, 
\q1 And the heaviness of the heart breaketh strength. 
\q1
\v 19 In affliction also sorrow remaineth: 
\q1 And the life of the poor \add is\add* the curse of the heart. 
\q1
\v 20 Take no heaviness to heart: 
\q1 Drive it away, and remember the last end. 
\q1
\v 21 Forget \add it\add* not, for there is no turning again: 
\q1 Thou shalt not do him good, but hurt thyself. 
\q1
\v 22 Remember my judgment: for thine also \add shall be\add* so; 
\q1 Yesterday for me, and to day for thee. 
\q1
\v 23 When the dead is at rest, let his remembrance rest; 
\q1 And be comforted for him, when his spirit is departed from \add him\add*. 
\b
\q1
\v 24 The wisdom of a learned man \add cometh\add* by opportunity of leisure: 
\q1 And he that hath little business shall become wise. 
\q1
\v 25 How can he get wisdom that holdeth the plough, 
\q1 And that glorieth in the goad, 
\q1 That driveth oxen, and is occupied in their labours, 
\q1 And whose talk \add is\add* of bullocks? 
\q1
\v 26 He giveth his mind to make furrows; 
\q1 And \add is\add* diligent to give the kine fodder. 
\q1
\v 27 So every carpenter and workmaster, 
\q1 That laboureth night and day: 
\q1 \add And\add* they that cut and grave seals, 
\q1 And \add are\add* diligent to make great variety, 
\q1 \add And\add* give themselves to counterfeit imagery, 
\q1 And watch to finish a work: 
\q1
\v 28 The smith also sitting by the anvil, 
\q1 And considering the iron work, 
\q1 The vapour of the fire wasteth his flesh, 
\q1 And he fighteth with the heat of the furnace: 
\q1 The noise of the hammer and the anvil is ever in his ears, 
\q1 And his eyes \add look still\add* upon the pattern of the thing that he maketh; 
\q1 He setteth his mind to finish \add his\add* work, 
\q1 And watcheth to polish \add it\add* perfectly: 
\q1
\v 29 So \add doth\add* the potter sitting at his work, 
\q1 And turning the wheel about with his feet, 
\q1 Who is alway carefully set at his work, 
\q1 And \add maketh\add* all his work by number; 
\q1
\v 30 He fashioneth the clay with his arm, 
\q1 And boweth down his strength before \add his\add* feet; 
\q1 He applieth himself to lead it over; 
\q1 And he \add is\add* diligent to make clean the furnace: 
\q1
\v 31 All these trust to their hands: 
\q1 And every one is wise in his work. 
\q1
\v 32 Without these cannot a city be inhabited: 
\q1 And they shall not dwell where they will, nor go up and down: 
\q1
\v 33 They shall not be sought for in publick counsel, 
\q1 Nor sit high in the congregation: 
\q1 They shall not sit on the judges’ seat, 
\q1 Nor understand the sentence of judgment: 
\q1 They cannot declare justice and judgment; 
\q1 And they shall not be found where parables are spoken. 
\q1
\v 34 But they will maintain the state of the world, 
\q1 And \add all\add* their desire \add is\add* in the work of \add their\add* craft. 
\b
\c  39  
\q1
\v 1 But he that giveth his mind to the law of the most High, 
\q1 And is occupied in the meditation \add thereof\add*, 
\q1 Will seek out the wisdom of all the ancient, 
\q1 And be occupied in prophecies. 
\q1
\v 2 He will keep the sayings of the renowned men: 
\q1 And where subtil parables are, he will be there also. 
\q1
\v 3 He will seek out the secrets of grave sentences, 
\q1 And be conversant in dark parables. 
\q1
\v 4 He shall serve among great men, 
\q1 And appear before princes: 
\q1 He will travel through strange countries; 
\q1 For he hath tried the good and the evil among men. 
\q1
\v 5 He will give his heart to resort early to the Lord that made him, 
\q1 And will pray before the most High, 
\q1 And will open his mouth in prayer, 
\q1 And make supplication for his sins. 
\q1
\v 6 When the great Lord will, 
\q1 He shall be filled with the spirit of understanding: 
\q1 He shall pour out wise sentences, 
\q1 And give thanks unto the Lord in \add his\add* prayer. 
\q1
\v 7 He shall direct his counsel and knowledge, 
\q1 And in his secrets shall he meditate. 
\q1
\v 8 He shall shew forth that which he hath learned, 
\q1 And shall glory in the law of the covenant of the Lord. 
\q1
\v 9 Many shall commend his understanding; 
\q1 And so long as the world endureth, it shall not be blotted out; 
\q1 His memorial shall not depart away, 
\q1 And his name shall live from generation to generation. 
\q1
\v 10 Nations shall shew forth his wisdom, 
\q1 And the congregation shall declare his praise. 
\q1
\v 11 If he die, he shall leave a \add greater\add* name than a thousand: 
\q1 And if he live, he shall increase it. 
\b
\q1
\v 12 Yet have I \add more\add* to say, \add which\add* I have thought upon; 
\q1 For I am filled as the moon at the full. 
\b
\q1
\v 13 Hearken unto me, \add ye\add* holy children, 
\q1 And bud forth as a rose growing by the brook of the field: 
\q1
\v 14 And give ye a sweet savour as frankincense, 
\q1 And flourish as a lily, 
\q1 Send forth a smell, and sing a song \add of praise\add*, 
\q1 Bless the Lord in all his works. 
\q1
\v 15 Magnify his name, 
\q1 And shew forth his praise 
\q1 With the songs of \add your\add* lips, and with harps, 
\q1 And in praising \add him\add* you shall say after this manner: 
\b
\q1
\v 16 All the works of the Lord are exceeding good, 
\q1 And whatsoever he commandeth shall be \add accomplished\add* in due season. 
\q1
\v 17 And none may say, What \add is\add* this? wherefore \add is\add* that? 
\q1 For at time convenient they shall all be sought \add out:\add* 
\q1 At his commandment the waters stood as a heap, 
\q1 And at the words of his mouth the receptacles of waters. 
\q1
\v 18 At his commandment \add is done\add* whatsoever pleaseth \add him;\add* 
\q1 And none can hinder, when he will save. 
\q1
\v 19 The works of all flesh \add are\add* before him, 
\q1 And nothing can be hid from his eyes. 
\q1
\v 20 He seeth from everlasting to everlasting; 
\q1 And there is nothing wonderful before him. 
\q1
\v 21  \add A man\add* need not to say, What \add is\add* this? wherefore \add is\add* that? 
\q1 For he hath made all \add things\add* for their uses. 
\q1
\v 22 His blessing covered the dry \add land\add* as a river, 
\q1 And watered \add it\add* as a flood. 
\q1
\v 23 As he hath turned the waters into saltness: 
\q1 So shall the heathen inherit his wrath. 
\q1
\v 24  \add As\add* his ways \add are\add* plain unto the holy; 
\q1 So \add are\add* they stumblingblocks unto the wicked. 
\q1
\v 25 For the good are good \add things\add* created from the beginning: 
\q1 So evil \add things\add* for sinners. 
\q1
\v 26 The principal things for the whole use of man’s life 
\q1 \add Are\add* water, fire, iron, and salt, 
\q1 Flour of wheat, honey, milk, 
\q1 \add And\add* the blood of the grape, and oil, and clothing. 
\q1
\v 27 All these \add things are\add* for good to the godly: 
\q1 So to the sinners they are turned into evil. 
\q1
\v 28 There be spirits that are created for vengeance, 
\q1 Which in their fury lay on \add sore\add* strokes; 
\q1 In the time of destruction they pour out \add their\add* force, 
\q1 And appease the wrath of him that made them. 
\q1
\v 29 Fire, and hail, and famine, and death, 
\q1 All these were created for vengeance; 
\q1
\v 30 Teeth of wild beasts, and scorpions, serpents, 
\q1 And the sword, punishing the wicked to destruction. 
\q1
\v 31 They shall rejoice in his commandment, 
\q1 And they shall be ready upon earth, when need is; 
\q1 And when their time is come, they shall not transgress \add his\add* word. 
\b
\q1
\v 32 Therefore from the beginning I was resolved, 
\q1 And thought upon \add these things\add*, and have left \add them\add* in writing. 
\q1
\v 33 All the works of the Lord \add are\add* good: 
\q1 And he will give every needful thing in due season. 
\q1
\v 34 So that \add a man\add* cannot say, This \add is\add* worse than that: 
\q1 For in time they shall all be well approved. 
\q1
\v 35 And therefore praise ye \add the Lord\add* with the whole heart and mouth, 
\q1 And bless the name of the Lord. 
\b
\c  40  
\q1
\v 1 Great travail is created for every man, 
\q1 And a heavy yoke \add is\add* upon the sons of Adam, 
\q1 From the day that \add they\add* go out of their mother’s womb, 
\q1 Till the day that \add they\add* return to the mother of all \add things\add*. 
\q1
\v 2 Their imagination of things to come, \add and\add* the day of death, 
\q1 \add Trouble\add* their thoughts, and \add cause\add* fear of heart; 
\q1
\v 3 From him that sitteth on a throne of glory, 
\q1 Unto him that is humbled in earth and ashes; 
\q1
\v 4 From him that weareth purple and a crown, 
\q1 Unto him that is clothed with a linen frock. 
\q1
\v 5 Wrath, and envy, trouble, and unquietness, fear of death, and anger, and strife, 
\q1 And in the time of rest upon \add his\add* bed \add his\add* night sleep, do change his knowledge. 
\q1
\v 6 A little or nothing \add is his\add* rest, 
\q1 And afterward \add he is\add* in \add his\add* sleep, as in a day of keeping watch, 
\q1 Troubled in the vision of his heart, 
\q1 As if he were escaped out of a battle. 
\q1
\v 7 When all is safe, he awaketh, 
\q1 And marvelleth that the fear was nothing. 
\q1
\v 8  \add Such things happen\add* unto all flesh, both man and beast, 
\q1 And \add that is\add* sevenfold more upon sinners. 
\q1
\v 9 Death, and bloodshed, strife, and sword, 
\q1 Calamities, famine, tribulation, and the scourge; 
\q1
\v 10 These \add things\add* are created for the wicked, 
\q1 And for their sakes came the flood. 
\q1
\v 11 All \add things\add* that \add are\add* of the earth shall turn to the earth again: 
\q1 And \add that which is\add* of the waters doth return into the sea. 
\b
\q1
\v 12 All bribery and injustice shall be blotted out: 
\q1 But true dealing shall endure for ever. 
\q1
\v 13 The goods of the unjust shall be dried up like a river, 
\q1 And shall vanish with noise, like a great thunder in rain. 
\q1
\v 14 While he openeth \add his\add* hand he shall rejoice: 
\q1 So shall transgressors come to nought. 
\q1
\v 15 The children of the ungodly shall not bring forth many branches; 
\q1 But \add are as\add* unclean roots upon a hard rock. 
\q1
\v 16 The weed \add growing\add* upon every water and bank of a river 
\q1 Shall be pulled up before all grass. 
\q1
\v 17 Bountifulness \add is\add* as a most fruitful garden, 
\q1 And mercifulness endureth for ever. 
\q1
\v 18 To labour, and to be content with that a man hath, is a sweet life: 
\q1 But he that findeth a treasure \add is\add* above \add them\add* both. 
\q1
\v 19 Children and the building of a city continue a \add man’s\add* name: 
\q1 But a blameless wife is counted above \add them\add* both. 
\q1
\v 20 Wine and musick rejoice the heart: 
\q1 But the love of wisdom \add is\add* above \add them\add* both. 
\q1
\v 21 The pipe and the psaltery make sweet melody: 
\q1 But a pleasant tongue \add is\add* above \add them\add* both. 
\q1
\v 22 Thine eye desireth favour and beauty: 
\q1 But more than both corn while it is green. 
\q1
\v 23 A friend and companion never meet amiss: 
\q1 But above both \add is\add* a wife with \add her\add* husband. 
\q1
\v 24 Brethren and help \add are\add* against time of trouble: 
\q1 But alms shall deliver more than \add them\add* both. 
\q1
\v 25 Gold and silver make the foot stand sure: 
\q1 But counsel is esteemed above \add them\add* both. 
\q1
\v 26 Riches and strength lift up the heart: 
\q1 But the fear of the Lord \add is\add* above \add them\add* both: 
\q1 There is no want in the fear of the Lord, 
\q1 And it needeth not to seek help. 
\q1
\v 27 The fear of the Lord \add is\add* a fruitful garden, 
\q1 And covereth him above all glory. 
\q1
\v 28  \add My\add* son, lead not a beggar’s life; 
\q1 \add For\add* better \add it is\add* to die than to beg. 
\q1
\v 29 The life of him that dependeth on another man’s table is not to be counted for a life; 
\q1 \add For\add* he polluteth himself with other men’s meat: 
\q1 But a wise man well nurtured will beware \add thereof\add*. 
\q1
\v 30 Begging is sweet in the mouth of the shameless: 
\q1 But in his belly there shall burn a fire. 
\b
\c  41  
\q1
\v 1 O death, how bitter is the remembrance of thee to a man that liveth at rest in his possessions, 
\q1 Unto the man that hath nothing to vex him, and that hath prosperity in all \add things:\add* 
\q1 Yea unto him that is yet able to receive meat! 
\q1
\v 2 O death, acceptable is thy sentence unto the needy, 
\q1 And unto him whose strength faileth, that is now in the last age, 
\q1 And is vexed with all \add things\add*, 
\q1 And to him that despaireth, and hath lost patience! 
\q1
\v 3 Fear not the sentence of death, 
\q1 Remember them \add that have been\add* before thee, and \add that\add* come after; 
\q1 For this \add is\add* the sentence of the Lord over all flesh. 
\q1
\v 4 And why art thou against the pleasure of the most High? 
\q1 There is no inquisition in the grave, 
\q1 Whether thou have lived ten, or an hundred, or a thousand years. 
\q1
\v 5 The children of sinners are abominable children, 
\q1 And they that are conversant in the dwelling of the ungodly. 
\q1
\v 6 The inheritance of sinners’ children shall perish, 
\q1 And their posterity shall have a perpetual reproach. 
\q1
\v 7 The children will complain of an ungodly father, 
\q1 Because they shall be reproached for his sake. 
\q1
\v 8 Woe be unto you, ungodly men, 
\q1 Which have forsaken the law of the most high God! 
\q1 For if you increase, \add it shall be\add* to \add your\add* destruction: 
\q1
\v 9 And if you be born, you shall be born to a curse; 
\q1 And if you die, a curse shall be your portion. 
\q1
\v 10 All that \add are\add* of the earth shall turn to earth \add again:\add* 
\q1 So the ungodly \add shall go\add* from a curse to destruction. 
\q1
\v 11 The mourning of men \add is\add* about their bodies: 
\q1 But an ill name of sinners shall be blotted out. 
\q1
\v 12 Have regard to \add thy\add* name; for that shall continue with thee 
\q1 Above a thousand great treasures of gold. 
\q1
\v 13 A good life hath \add but\add* few days: 
\q1 But a good name endureth for ever. 
\b
\q1
\v 14  \add My\add* children, keep discipline in peace: 
\q1 For wisdom that is hid, and a treasure \add that is\add* not seen, 
\q1 What profit \add is\add* in \add them\add* both? 
\q1
\v 15 A man that hideth his foolishness \add is\add* better 
\q1 Than a man that hideth his wisdom. 
\q1
\v 16 Therefore be shamefast according to my word: 
\q1 For it is not good to retain all shamefastness; 
\q1 Neither is it altogether approved in every \add thing\add*. 
\q1
\v 17 Be ashamed of whoredom before father and mother: 
\q1 And of a lie before a prince and a mighty man; 
\q1
\v 18 Of an offence before a judge and ruler; 
\q1 Of iniquity before a congregation and people; 
\q1 Of unjust dealing before \add thy\add* partner and friend; 
\q1
\v 19 And of theft in regard of the place where thou sojournest, 
\q1 And in regard of the truth of God and \add his\add* covenant; 
\q1 And to lean with \add thine\add* elbow upon the meat; 
\q1 And of scorning to give and take; 
\q1
\v 20 And of silence before them that salute \add thee;\add* 
\q1 And to look upon a harlot; 
\q1
\v 21 And to turn away thy face from \add thy\add* kinsman; 
\q1 \add Or\add* to take away a portion or a gift; 
\q1 Or to gaze upon another man’s wife; 
\q1
\v 22  \add Or\add* to be overbusy with his maid, 
\q1 And come not near her bed; 
\q1 \add Or\add* of upbraiding speeches before friends; 
\q1 And after \add thou\add* hast given, upbraid not; 
\q1
\v 23 Or of iterating and speaking \add again\add* that which \add thou\add* hast heard; 
\q1 And of revealing of secrets. 
\q1
\v 24 So shalt thou be truly shamefast, 
\q1 And find favour before all men. 
\b
\c  42  
\q1
\v 1 Of these \add things\add* be not thou ashamed, 
\q1 And accept no person to sin \add thereby:\add* 
\q1
\v 2 Of the law of the most High, and \add his\add* covenant; 
\q1 And of judgment to justify the ungodly; 
\q1
\v 3 Of reckoning with \add thy\add* partners and travellers; 
\q1 Or of the gift of the heritage of friends; 
\q1
\v 4 Of exactness of balance and weights; 
\q1 Or of getting much or little; 
\q1
\v 5 And of merchants’ indifferent selling; 
\q1 Of much correction of children; 
\q1 And to make the side of an evil servant to bleed. 
\q1
\v 6 Sure keeping \add is\add* good, where an evil wife is; 
\q1 And shut up, where many hands \add are\add*. 
\q1
\v 7 Deliver all \add things\add* in number and weight; 
\q1 And \add put\add* all in writing that thou givest out, or receivest in. 
\q1
\v 8  \add Be not ashamed\add* to inform the unwise and foolish, 
\q1 And the extreme aged that contendeth with \add those that are\add* young: 
\q1 Thus shalt thou be truly learned, 
\q1 And approved of all \add men\add* living. 
\b
\q1
\v 9 The father waketh for the daughter, when no man knoweth; 
\q1 And the care for her taketh away sleep: 
\q1 When she is young, lest she pass away the flower of her age; 
\q1 And being married, lest she should be hated; 
\q1
\v 10 In \add her\add* virginity, lest she should be defiled 
\q1 And gotten with child in her father’s house; 
\q1 \add And\add* having a husband, lest she should misbehave herself; 
\q1 And when she is married, lest she should be barren. 
\q1
\v 11 Keep a sure watch over a shameless daughter, 
\q1 Lest she make thee a laughing-stock to \add thine\add* enemies, 
\q1 \add And\add* a byword in the city, and a reproach among the people, 
\q1 And make thee ashamed before the multitude. 
\q1
\v 12 Behold not every body’s beauty, 
\q1 And sit not in the midst of women. 
\q1
\v 13 For from garments cometh a moth, 
\q1 And from women wickedness. 
\q1
\v 14 Better \add is\add* the churlishness of a man than a courteous woman, 
\q1 A woman, \add I say\add*, which bringeth shame and reproach. 
\b
\q1
\v 15 I will now remember the works of the Lord, 
\q1 And declare \add the things\add* that I have seen; 
\q1 In the words of the Lord \add are\add* his works. 
\q1
\v 16 The sun that giveth light looketh upon all \add things\add*, 
\q1 And the work thereof \add is\add* full of the glory of the Lord. 
\q1
\v 17 The Lord hath not given power to the saints to declare all his marvellous works, 
\q1 Which the Almighty Lord firmly settled, 
\q1 That whatsoever is might be established for his glory. 
\q1
\v 18 He seeketh out the deep, and the heart, 
\q1 And considereth their crafty devices; 
\q1 For the Lord knoweth all that may be known, 
\q1 And he beholdeth the signs of the world. 
\q1
\v 19 He declareth the \add things\add* that are past, and for to come, 
\q1 And revealeth the steps of hidden \add things\add*. 
\q1
\v 20 No thought escapeth him, 
\q1 Neither any word is hidden from him. 
\q1
\v 21 He hath garnished the excellent works of his wisdom, 
\q1 And he is from everlasting to everlasting: 
\q1 \add Unto him\add* may nothing be added, neither can he be diminished, 
\q1 And he hath no need of any counseller. 
\q1
\v 22 O how desirable \add are\add* all his works! 
\q1 And \add that a man\add* may see even to a spark. 
\q1
\v 23 All these \add things\add* live and remain for ever 
\q1 For all uses, and they are all obedient. 
\q1
\v 24 All \add things are\add* double one against another: 
\q1 And he hath made nothing unperfect. 
\q1
\v 25 One \add thing\add* establisheth the good or another: 
\q1 And who shall be filled with beholding his glory? 
\b
\c  43  
\q1
\v 1 The pride of the height, the clear firmament, 
\q1 The beauty of heaven, with \add his\add* glorious shew; 
\q1
\v 2 The sun when \add it\add* appeareth, declaring at \add his\add* rising 
\q1 A marvellous instrument, the work of the most High: 
\q1
\v 3 At noon it parcheth the country, 
\q1 And who can abide the burning heat thereof? 
\q1
\v 4  \add A man\add* blowing a furnace \add is\add* in works of heat, 
\q1 \add But\add* the sun burneth the mountains three times \add more;\add* 
\q1 Breathing out fiery vapours, 
\q1 And sending forth bright beams, it dimmeth the eyes. 
\q1
\v 5 Great \add is\add* the Lord that made it; 
\q1 And at his commandment it runneth hastily. 
\q1
\v 6 He made the moon also to serve in her season 
\q1 \add For\add* a declaration of times, and a sign of the world. 
\q1
\v 7 From the moon \add is\add* the sign of feasts, a light that decreaseth in \add her\add* perfection. 
\q1
\v 8 The month is \add called\add* after her name, increasing wonderfully in \add her\add* changing, 
\q1 \add Being\add* an instrument of the armies above, shining in the firmament of heaven; 
\q1
\v 9 The beauty of heaven, the glory of the stars, 
\q1 An ornament giving light in the highest \add places\add* of the Lord. 
\q1
\v 10 At the commandment of the Holy One they will stand in \add their\add* order, 
\q1 And never faint in their watches. 
\q1
\v 11 Look upon the \add rainbow\add*, and praise him that made it; 
\q1 Very beautiful \add it is\add* in the brightness thereof. 
\q1
\v 12 It compasseth the heaven about with a glorious circle, 
\q1 \add And\add* the hands of the most High have bended it. 
\q1
\v 13 By his commandment he maketh the snow to fall apace, 
\q1 And sendeth swiftly the lightnings of his judgment. 
\q1
\v 14 Through this the treasures are opened: 
\q1 And clouds fly forth as fowls. 
\q1
\v 15 By his great power he maketh the clouds firm, 
\q1 And the hailstones are broken small. 
\q1
\v 16 At his sight the mountains are shaken, 
\q1 And at his will the south wind bloweth. 
\q1
\v 17 The noise of the thunder maketh the earth to tremble: 
\q1 So \add doth\add* the northern storm and the whirlwind: 
\q1 As birds flying he scattereth the snow, 
\q1 And the falling down thereof \add is\add* as the lighting of grasshoppers: 
\q1
\v 18 The eye marvelleth at the beauty of the whiteness thereof, 
\q1 And the heart is astonished at the raining of it. 
\q1
\v 19 The hoar frost also as salt he poureth on the earth, 
\q1 And being congealed, it lieth on the top of sharp stakes. 
\q1
\v 20 When the cold north wind bloweth, 
\q1 And the water is congealed into ice, 
\q1 It abideth upon every gathering together of water, 
\q1 And clotheth the water as with a breastplate. 
\q1
\v 21 It devoureth the mountains, and burneth the wilderness, 
\q1 And consumeth the grass as fire. 
\q1
\v 22 A present remedy of all \add is\add* a mist \add coming speedily:\add* 
\q1 A dew coming after heat refresheth. 
\q1
\v 23 By his counsel he appeaseth the deep, 
\q1 And planteth islands therein. 
\q1
\v 24 They that sail \add on\add* the sea tell of the danger thereof; 
\q1 And when we hear \add it\add* with our ears, we marvel \add thereat\add*. 
\q1
\v 25 For therein \add be\add* strange and wondrous works, 
\q1 Variety of all \add kinds of\add* beasts \add and\add* whales created. 
\q1
\v 26 By him the end of them \add hath\add* prosperous success, 
\q1 And by his word all \add things\add* consist. 
\q1
\v 27 We may speak much, and \add yet\add* come short; 
\q1 Wherefore in sum, he is all. 
\q1
\v 28 How shall we be able to magnify \add him?\add* 
\q1 For he \add is\add* great above all his works. 
\q1
\v 29 The Lord \add is\add* terrible and very great, 
\q1 And marvellous \add is\add* his power. 
\q1
\v 30 When you glorify the Lord, exalt \add him\add* as much as you can; 
\q1 For even yet will he far exceed: 
\q1 And when you exalt him, put forth all your strength, 
\q1 \add And\add* be not weary; for you can never go far enough. 
\q1
\v 31 Who hath seen him, that he might tell \add us?\add* 
\q1 And who can magnify him as he is? 
\q1
\v 32 There are yet hid greater \add things\add* than these \add be\add*, 
\q1 For we have seen \add but\add* a few of his works. 
\q1
\v 33 For the Lord hath made all \add things;\add* 
\q1 And to the godly hath he given wisdom. 
\b
\c  44  
\q1
\v 1 Let us now praise famous men, 
\q1 And our fathers that begat \add us\add*. 
\q1
\v 2 The Lord hath wrought great glory by them 
\q1 Through his great power from the beginning. 
\q1
\v 3 Such as did bear rule in their kingdoms, 
\q1 Men renowned for \add their\add* power, 
\q1 Giving counsel by their understanding, 
\q1 And declaring prophecies: 
\q1
\v 4 Leaders of the people by \add their\add* counsels, 
\q1 And by \add their\add* knowledge of learning meet for the people, 
\q1 Wise and eloquent in their instructions: 
\q1
\v 5 Such as found out musical tunes, 
\q1 And recited verses in writing: 
\q1
\v 6 Rich men furnished with ability, 
\q1 Living peaceably in their habitations: 
\q1
\v 7 All these were honoured in \add their\add* generations, 
\q1 And \add were\add* the glory of their times. 
\q1
\v 8 There be of them, that have left a name behind them, 
\q1 That \add their\add* praises might be reported. 
\q1
\v 9 And \add some\add* there be, which have no memorial; 
\q1 Who are perished, as though they had never been; 
\q1 And are become as though they had never been born; 
\q1 And their children after them. 
\q1
\v 10 But these \add were\add* merciful men, 
\q1 Whose righteousness hath not been forgotten. 
\q1
\v 11 With their seed shall continually remain a good inheritance, 
\q1 \add And\add* their children \add are\add* within the covenant. 
\q1
\v 12 Their seed standeth fast, and their children for their sakes. 
\q1
\v 13 Their seed shall remain for ever, 
\q1 And their glory shall not be blotted out. 
\q1
\v 14 Their bodies are buried in peace; 
\q1 But their name liveth for evermore. 
\q1
\v 15 The people will tell of their wisdom, 
\q1 And the congregation will shew forth their praise. 
\q1
\v 16 Enoch pleased the Lord, and was translated, 
\q1 \add Being\add* an example of repentance to \add all\add* generations. 
\b
\q1
\v 17 Noah was found perfect \add and\add* righteous; 
\q1 In the time of wrath he was taken in exchange \add for the world;\add* 
\q1 Therefore was he left \add as\add* a remnant unto the earth, 
\q1 When the flood came. 
\q1
\v 18 An everlasting covenant was made with him, 
\q1 That all flesh should perish no \add more\add* by \add the\add* flood. 
\b
\q1
\v 19 Abraham \add was\add* a great father of many people: 
\q1 In glory was there none like unto him; 
\q1
\v 20 Who kept the law of the most High, 
\q1 And was in covenant with him: 
\q1 He established the covenant in his flesh; 
\q1 And when \add he\add* was proved, he was found faithful. 
\q1
\v 21 Therefore he assured him by an oath, 
\q1 That \add he\add* would bless the nations in his seed, 
\q1 \add And\add* that \add he\add* would multiply him as the dust of the earth, 
\q1 And exalt his seed as the stars, 
\q1 And cause them to inherit from sea to sea, 
\q1 And from the river unto the utmost part of the land. 
\b
\q1
\v 22 With Isaac did he establish likewise (for Abraham his father’s sake) 
\q1 The blessing of all men and the covenant, 
\q1
\v 23 And made \add it\add* rest upon the head of Jacob. 
\q1 He acknowledged him in his blessing, 
\q1 And gave him an heritage, 
\q1 And divided his portions; 
\q1 Among the twelve tribes did he part \add them\add*. 
\b
\c  45  
\q1
\v 1 And he brought out of him a merciful man, 
\q1 Which found favour in the sight of all flesh, 
\q1 \add Even\add* Moses, beloved of God and men, 
\q1 Whose memorial \add is\add* blessed. 
\q1
\v 2 He made him like to the glorious saints, 
\q1 And magnified him, so that \add his\add* enemies stood in fear \add of him\add*. 
\q1
\v 3 By his words he caused the wonders to cease, 
\q1 And he made him glorious in the sight of kings, 
\q1 \add And\add* gave him a commandment for his people, 
\q1 And shewed him \add part\add* of his glory. 
\q1
\v 4 He sanctified him in his faithfulness and meekness, 
\q1 \add And\add* chose him out of all men. 
\q1
\v 5 He made him to hear his voice, 
\q1 And brought him into the dark \add cloud\add*, 
\q1 And gave him commandments before \add his\add* face, 
\q1 \add Even\add* the law of life and knowledge, 
\q1 That \add he\add* might teach Jacob \add his\add* covenants, 
\q1 And Israel his judgments. 
\b
\q1
\v 6 He exalted Aaron, a holy \add man\add* like unto him, 
\q1 \add Even\add* his brother, of the tribe of Levi. 
\q1
\v 7 An everlasting covenant he made with him, 
\q1 And gave him the priesthood among the people; 
\q1 He beautified him with comely ornaments, 
\q1 And clothed him with a robe of glory. 
\q1
\v 8 He put upon him perfect glory; 
\q1 And strengthened him with rich garments, 
\q1 \add With\add* breeches, with a long robe, and the ephod. 
\q1
\v 9 And he compassed him with pomegranates, 
\q1 \add And\add* with many golden bells round about, 
\q1 That as he went there might be a sound, 
\q1 \add And\add* a noise made that might be heard in the temple, 
\q1 For a memorial to the children of his people; 
\q1
\v 10 With a holy garment, with gold, and blue \add silk\add*, 
\q1 And purple, the work of the embroiderer, 
\q1 With a breastplate of judgment, \add and\add* with Urim and Thummim; 
\q1
\v 11 With twisted scarlet, the work of the cunning workman, 
\q1 With precious stones graven like seals, 
\q1 \add And\add* set in gold, the work of the jeweller, 
\q1 With a writing engraved for a memorial, 
\q1 After the number of the tribes of Israel. 
\q1
\v 12  \add He set\add* a crown of gold upon the mitre, 
\q1 Wherein was engraved Holiness, 
\q1 An ornament of honour, a costly work, 
\q1 The desires of the eyes, goodly \add and\add* beautiful. 
\q1
\v 13 Before him there were none such, 
\q1 Neither did \add ever any\add* stranger put \add them\add* on, 
\q1 But only his children 
\q1 And his children’s children perpetually. 
\q1
\v 14 Their sacrifices shall be wholly consumed every day twice continually. 
\q1
\v 15 Moses consecrated him, and anointed him with holy oil: 
\q1 \add This\add* was appointed unto him by an everlasting covenant, 
\q1 And to his seed, so long as the heavens should remain, 
\q1 That \add they\add* should minister unto him, and execute the office of the priesthood, 
\q1 And bless the people in his name. 
\q1
\v 16 He chose him out of all \add men\add* living 
\q1 To offer sacrifices to the Lord, 
\q1 Incense, and a sweet savour, for a memorial, 
\q1 To make reconciliation for his people. 
\q1
\v 17 He gave unto him his commandments, 
\q1 \add And\add* authority in the statutes of judgments, 
\q1 That \add he\add* should teach Jacob the testimonies, 
\q1 And inform Israel in his laws. 
\q1
\v 18 Strangers conspired together against him, 
\q1 And maligned him in the wilderness, 
\q1 \add Even\add* the men that were of Dathan’s and Abiron’s side, 
\q1 And the congregation of Core, with fury and wrath. 
\q1
\v 19  \add This\add* the Lord saw, and it displeased him, 
\q1 And in \add his\add* wrathful indignation were they consumed: 
\q1 He did wonders upon them, to consume them with the fiery flame. 
\q1
\v 20 But he made Aaron more honourable, 
\q1 And gave him an heritage, 
\q1 And divided unto him the firstfruits of the increase; 
\q1 Especially he prepared bread in abundance: 
\q1
\v 21 For they eat \add of\add* the sacrifices of the Lord, 
\q1 Which he gave unto him and his seed. 
\q1
\v 22 Howbeit in the land of the people he had no inheritance, 
\q1 Neither had he \add any\add* portion among the people: 
\q1 For \add the Lord\add* himself \add is\add* his portion and inheritance. 
\b
\q1
\v 23 The third in glory \add is\add* Phinees the son of Eleazar, 
\q1 Because he had zeal in the fear of the Lord, 
\q1 And stood \add up\add* with good courage of heart when the people were turned \add back\add*, 
\q1 And made reconciliation for Israel. 
\q1
\v 24 Therefore was there a covenant of peace made with him, 
\q1 That \add he\add* should be the chief of the sanctuary and of his people, 
\q1 \add And\add* that he and his posterity should have the dignity of the priesthood for ever: 
\q1
\v 25 According to the covenant \add made\add* with David son of Jesse, of the tribe of Juda, 
\q1 \add That\add* the inheritance of the king \add should be\add* to \add his\add* posterity alone: 
\q1 \add So\add* the inheritance of Aaron \add should\add* also \add be\add* unto his seed. 
\q1
\v 26  \add God\add* give you wisdom in your heart 
\q1 To judge his people in righteousness, 
\q1 That their good \add things\add* be not abolished, 
\q1 And \add that\add* their glory \add may endure\add* for ever. 
\b
\c  46  
\q1
\v 1 Jesus the son of Naue \add was\add* valiant in the wars, 
\q1 And \add was\add* the successor of Moses in prophecies, 
\q1 Who according to his name was made great 
\q1 For the saving of the elect of God, 
\q1 \add And\add* taking vengeance of the enemies that rose up against \add them\add*, 
\q1 That he might set Israel in their inheritance. 
\q1
\v 2 How great glory gat he, when \add he\add* did lift up his hands, 
\q1 And stretched out \add his\add* sword against the cities! 
\q1
\v 3 Who before him so stood \add to it?\add* 
\q1 For the Lord himself brought \add his\add* enemies unto \add him\add*. 
\q1
\v 4 Did not the sun go back by his means? 
\q1 And was \add not\add* one day as long as two? 
\q1
\v 5 He called upon the most high Lord, 
\q1 When the enemies pressed upon him on every side; 
\q1 And the great Lord heard him. 
\q1
\v 6  \add And\add* with hailstones of mighty power 
\q1 He made the battle to fall violently upon the nations, 
\q1 And in the descent \add of Bethoron\add* he destroyed them that resisted, 
\q1 That the nations might know all their strength, 
\q1 Because he fought in the sight of the Lord, 
\q1 And he followed the Mighty One. 
\q1
\v 7 In the time of Moses also he did a \add work of\add* mercy, 
\q1 He and Caleb the son of Jephunne, 
\q1 In that \add they\add* withstood the congregation, 
\q1 \add And\add* withheld the people from sin, 
\q1 And appeased the wicked murmuring. 
\q1
\v 8 And of six hundred thousand people on foot, they two were preserved 
\q1 To bring them into the heritage, 
\q1 \add Even\add* unto the land that floweth with milk and honey. 
\b
\q1
\v 9 The Lord gave strength also unto Caleb, 
\q1 Which remained with him unto his old age: 
\q1 So that he entered upon the high places of the land, 
\q1 And his seed obtained \add it for\add* an heritage: 
\q1
\v 10 That all the children of Israel might see 
\q1 That \add it is\add* good to follow the Lord. 
\b
\q1
\v 11 And \add concerning\add* the judges, every one by name, 
\q1 Whose heart went not a whoring, 
\q1 Nor departed from the Lord, 
\q1 Let their memory be blessed. 
\q1
\v 12 Let their bones flourish out of their place, 
\q1 And let the name of them that were honoured \add be\add* continued upon their children. 
\b
\q1
\v 13 Samuel, the prophet of the Lord, beloved of his Lord, 
\q1 Established a kingdom, and anointed princes over his people. 
\q1
\v 14 By the law of the Lord he judged the congregation, 
\q1 And the Lord had respect unto Jacob. 
\q1
\v 15 By his faithfulness he was found a true prophet, 
\q1 And by his word he was known \add to be\add* faithful in vision. 
\q1
\v 16 He called upon the mighty Lord, 
\q1 When his enemies pressed \add upon him\add* on every side, 
\q1 When \add he\add* offered the sucking lamb. 
\q1
\v 17 And the Lord thundered from heaven, 
\q1 And with a great noise made his voice to be heard. 
\q1
\v 18 And he destroyed the rulers of the Tyrians, 
\q1 And all the princes of the Philistines. 
\q1
\v 19 And before \add his\add* long sleep he made protestations in the sight of the Lord and his anointed, 
\q1 I have not taken any man’s goods, so much as a shoe: 
\q1 And no man did accuse him. 
\q1
\v 20 And after his death he prophesied, 
\q1 And shewed the king his end, 
\q1 And lift up his voice from the earth in prophecy, 
\q1 To blot out the wickedness of the people. 
\b
\c  47  
\q1
\v 1 And after him rose up Nathan to prophesy in the time of David. 
\b
\q1
\v 2 As \add is\add* the fat taken away from the peace offering, 
\q1 So \add was\add* David \add chosen\add* out of the children of Israel. 
\q1
\v 3 He played with lions as with kids, 
\q1 And with bears as with lambs. 
\q1
\v 4 Slew he not a giant, when he was \add yet but\add* young? 
\q1 And did he \add not\add* take away reproach from the people, 
\q1 When \add he\add* lifted up \add his\add* hand with the stone in the sling, 
\q1 And beat down the boasting of Goliath? 
\q1
\v 5 For he called upon the most high Lord; 
\q1 And he gave \add him\add* strength in his right hand 
\q1 To slay \add that\add* mighty warrior, 
\q1 \add And\add* set up the horn of his people. 
\q1
\v 6 So \add the people\add* honoured him with ten thousands, 
\q1 And praised him in the blessings of the Lord, 
\q1 In that \add he\add* gave him a crown of glory. 
\q1
\v 7 For he destroyed the enemies on every side, 
\q1 And brought to nought the Philistines \add his\add* adversaries, 
\q1 \add And\add* brake their horn in sunder unto this day. 
\q1
\v 8 In all his works he praised the Holy One most high with words of glory; 
\q1 With his whole heart he sung songs, 
\q1 And loved him that made him. 
\q1
\v 9 He set singers also before the altar, 
\q1 That by their voices \add they\add* might make sweet melody, 
\q1 And daily sing praises in their songs. 
\q1
\v 10 He beautified \add their\add* feasts, 
\q1 And set in order the solemn times until the end, 
\q1 That they might praise his holy name, 
\q1 And that the temple might sound from morning. 
\q1
\v 11 The Lord took away his sins, 
\q1 And exalted his horn for ever: 
\q1 He gave him a covenant of kings, 
\q1 And a throne of glory in Israel. 
\b
\q1
\v 12 After him rose up a wise son, 
\q1 And for his sake he dwelt at large. 
\q1
\v 13 Solomon reigned in a peaceable time, and was honoured; 
\q1 For God made all quiet round about him, 
\q1 That he might build a house in his name, 
\q1 And prepare \add his\add* sanctuary for ever. 
\q1
\v 14 How wise wast thou in thy youth, 
\q1 And, as a flood, filled with understanding! 
\q1
\v 15 Thy soul covered the whole earth, 
\q1 And thou filledst \add it\add* with dark parables. 
\q1
\v 16 Thy name went far unto the islands; 
\q1 And for thy peace thou wast beloved. 
\q1
\v 17 The countries marvelled at thee for \add thy\add* songs, 
\q1 And proverbs, and parables, and interpretations. 
\q1
\v 18 By the name of the Lord God, 
\q1 Which is called the \add Lord\add* God of Israel, 
\q1 Thou didst gather gold as tin, 
\q1 And didst multiply silver as lead. 
\q1
\v 19 Thou didst bow thy loins unto women, 
\q1 And by thy body thou wast brought into subjection. 
\q1
\v 20 Thou didst stain thy honour, 
\q1 And pollute thy seed: 
\q1 So that \add thou\add* broughtest wrath upon thy children, 
\q1 And wast grieved for thy folly. 
\q1
\v 21  \add So\add* the kingdom was divided, 
\q1 And out of Ephraim ruled a rebellious kingdom. 
\q1
\v 22 But the Lord will never leave off his mercy, 
\q1 Neither shall \add any\add* of his works perish, 
\q1 Neither will he abolish the posterity of his elect, 
\q1 And the seed of him that loveth him he will not take away: 
\q1 Wherefore he gave a remnant unto Jacob, 
\q1 And out of him a root unto David. 
\q1
\v 23 Thus rested Solomon with his fathers, 
\q1 And of his seed he left behind him Roboam, 
\q1 \add Even\add* the foolishness of the people, and one that had no understanding, 
\q1 Who turned away the people through his counsel. 
\q1 \add There was\add* also Jeroboam the son of Nabat, 
\q1 Who caused Israel to sin, 
\q1 And shewed Ephraim the way of sin: 
\q1
\v 24 And their sins were multiplied exceedingly, 
\q1 That they were driven out of the land. 
\q1
\v 25 For they sought out all wickedness, 
\q1 Till the vengeance came upon them. 
\b
\c  48  
\q1
\v 1 Then stood up Elias the prophet as fire, 
\q1 And his word burnt like a lamp. 
\q1
\v 2 He brought a sore famine upon them, 
\q1 And by his zeal he diminished their number. 
\q1
\v 3 By the word of the Lord he shut up the heaven, 
\q1 And also three times brought down fire. 
\q1
\v 4 O Elias, how wast thou honoured in thy wondrous deeds! 
\q1 And who may glory like unto thee! 
\q1
\v 5 Who didst raise up a dead \add man\add* from death, 
\q1 And \add his\add* soul from the place of the dead, by the word of the most High: 
\q1
\v 6 Who broughtest kings to destruction, 
\q1 And honourable \add men\add* from their bed: 
\q1
\v 7 Who heardest the rebuke of the Lord in Sinai, 
\q1 And in Horeb the judgment of vengeance: 
\q1
\v 8 Who anointedst kings to take revenge, 
\q1 And prophets to succeed after him: 
\q1
\v 9 Who wast taken up in a whirlwind of fire, 
\q1 \add And\add* in a chariot of fiery horses: 
\q1
\v 10 Who wast ordained for reproofs in \add their\add* times, 
\q1 To pacify the wrath of the Lord’s judgment, before \add it break forth into\add* fury, 
\q1 And to turn the heart of the father unto the son, 
\q1 And to restore the tribes of Jacob. 
\q1
\v 11 Blessed \add are\add* they that saw thee, 
\q1 And slept in love; 
\q1 For we shall surely live. 
\b
\q1
\v 12 Elias \add it was\add*, who was covered with a whirlwind: 
\q1 And Eliseus was filled with his spirit: 
\q1 Whilst he lived, he was not moved \add with the presence\add* of \add any\add* prince, 
\q1 Neither could any bring him into subjection. 
\q1
\v 13 No word could overcome him; 
\q1 And after \add his\add* death his body prophesied. 
\q1
\v 14 He did wonders in his life, 
\q1 And at his death \add were\add* his works marvellous. 
\q1
\v 15 For all this the people repented not, 
\q1 Neither departed they from their sins, 
\q1 Till they were spoiled and carried out of their land, 
\q1 And were scattered through all the earth: 
\q1 Yet there remained a small people, 
\q1 And a ruler in the house of David: 
\q1
\v 16 Of whom some did \add that which was\add* pleasing \add to God\add*, 
\q1 And some multiplied sins. 
\b
\q1
\v 17 Ezekias fortified his city, 
\q1 And brought in water into the midst thereof: 
\q1 He digged the hard rock with iron, 
\q1 And made wells for waters. 
\q1
\v 18 In his time Sennacherib came up, 
\q1 And sent Rabsaces, 
\q1 And lift up his hand against Sion, 
\q1 And boasted proudly. 
\q1
\v 19 Then trembled their hearts and hands, 
\q1 And they were in pain, as \add women\add* in travail. 
\q1
\v 20 But they called upon the Lord \add which is\add* merciful, 
\q1 And stretched out their hands towards him: 
\q1 And immediately the Holy One heard them out of heaven, 
\q1 And delivered them by the ministry of Esay. 
\q1
\v 21 He smote the host of the Assyrians, 
\q1 And his angel destroyed them. 
\q1
\v 22 For Ezekias had done the \add thing\add* that pleased the Lord, 
\q1 And was strong in the ways of David his father, 
\q1 As Esay the prophet, who was great 
\q1 And faithful in his vision, had commanded \add him\add*. 
\q1
\v 23 In his time the sun went backward, 
\q1 And he lengthened the king’s life. 
\q1
\v 24 He saw by an excellent spirit \add what should come to pass at\add* the last, 
\q1 And he comforted them that mourned in Sion. 
\q1
\v 25 He shewed what should come to pass for ever, 
\q1 And secret \add things\add* or ever they came. 
\b
\c  49  
\q1
\v 1 The remembrance of Josias \add is\add* like the composition of the perfume 
\q1 That is made by the art of the apothecary: 
\q1 It is sweet as honey in all mouths, 
\q1 And as musick at a banquet of wine. 
\q1
\v 2 He behaved himself uprightly in the conversion of the people, 
\q1 And took away the abominations of iniquity. 
\q1
\v 3 He directed his heart unto the Lord, 
\q1 \add And\add* in the time of the ungodly he established the worship of God. 
\q1
\v 4 All, except David and Ezekias and Josias, were defective: 
\q1 For they forsook the law of the most High, 
\q1 \add Even\add* the kings of Judah failed. 
\q1
\v 5 Therefore he gave their power unto others, 
\q1 And their glory to a strange nation. 
\q1
\v 6 They burnt the chosen city of the sanctuary, 
\q1 And made the streets desolate, according to the prophecy of Jeremias. 
\b
\q1
\v 7 For they entreated him evil, 
\q1 Who nevertheless was a prophet, sanctified in \add his mother’s\add* womb, 
\q1 That \add he\add* might root out, and afflict, and destroy; 
\q1 \add And\add* that \add he\add* might build \add up\add* also, and plant. 
\b
\q1
\v 8  \add It was\add* Ezekiel who saw the glorious vision, 
\q1 Which was shewed him upon the chariot of the cherubims. 
\q1
\v 9 For he made mention of the enemies under the figure of the rain, 
\q1 And directed them that went right. 
\b
\q1
\v 10 And of the twelve prophets let the memorial be blessed, 
\q1 \add And\add* let \add their\add* bones flourish again out of their place: 
\q1 For they comforted Jacob, 
\q1 And delivered them by assured hope. 
\q1
\v 11 How shall we magnify Zorobabel? 
\q1 Even he \add was\add* as a signet on the right hand: 
\q1
\v 12 So \add was\add* Jesus the son of Josedec: 
\q1 Who in their time builded the house, 
\q1 And set up a holy temple to the Lord, 
\q1 Which was prepared for everlasting glory. 
\q1
\v 13 And among the elect was Neemias, 
\q1 Whose renown \add is\add* great, 
\q1 Who raised up for us the walls that were fallen, 
\q1 And set up the gates and the bars, 
\q1 And raised up our ruins \add again\add*. 
\q1
\v 14  \add But\add* upon the earth was no \add man\add* created like Enoch; 
\q1 For he was taken from the earth. 
\q1
\v 15 Neither was there a man born like unto Joseph, 
\q1 A governor of his brethren, a stay of the people, 
\q1 Whose bones were regarded of the Lord. 
\q1
\v 16 Sem and Seth were in great honour among men, 
\q1 And \add so was\add* Adam above every living thing in the creation. 
\b
\c  50  
\q1
\v 1 Simon the high priest, the son of Onias, 
\q1 Who in his life repaired the house \add again\add*, 
\q1 And in his days fortified the temple: 
\q1
\v 2 And by him was built from the foundation the double height, 
\q1 The high fortress of the wall about the temple: 
\q1
\v 3 In his days the cistern to receive water, being in compass as the sea, was covered with plates of brass: 
\q1
\v 4 He took care of the temple that \add it\add* should not fall, 
\q1 And fortified the city against besieging: 
\q1
\v 5 How was he honoured in the midst of the people 
\q1 In \add his\add* coming out of the sanctuary! 
\q1
\v 6  \add He was\add* as the morning star in the midst of a cloud, 
\q1 \add And\add* as the moon at the full: 
\q1
\v 7 As the sun shining upon the temple of the most High, 
\q1 And as the \add rain\add*bow giving light in the bright clouds: 
\q1
\v 8 And as the flower of roses in the spring of the year, 
\q1 As lilies by the rivers of waters, 
\q1 \add And\add* as the branches of the frankincense tree in the time of summer: 
\q1
\v 9 As fire and incense in the censer, 
\q1 \add And\add* as a vessel of beaten gold 
\q1 Set with all \add manner of\add* precious stones: 
\q1
\v 10  \add And\add* as a fair olive tree budding forth fruit, 
\q1 And as a cypress tree which groweth up to the clouds. 
\q1
\v 11 When he put on the robe of honour, 
\q1 And was clothed with the perfection of glory, 
\q1 When \add he\add* went up to the holy altar, 
\q1 He made the garment of holiness honourable. 
\q1
\v 12 When \add he\add* took the portions out of the priests’ hands, 
\q1 He himself stood by the hearth of the altar, 
\q1 Compassed with \add his\add* brethren round about, 
\q1 As a young cedar in Libanus; 
\q1 And as palm trees compassed they him round about. 
\q1
\v 13 So \add were\add* all the sons of Aaron in their glory, 
\q1 And the oblations of the Lord in their hands, 
\q1 Before all the congregation of Israel. 
\q1
\v 14 And finishing the service at the altar, 
\q1 That \add he\add* might adorn the offering of the most high Almighty, 
\q1
\v 15 He stretched out his hand to the cup, 
\q1 And poured of the blood of the grape, 
\q1 He poured out at the foot of the altar 
\q1 A sweetsmelling savour unto the most high King of all. 
\q1
\v 16 Then shouted the sons of Aaron, 
\q1 \add And\add* sounded the silver trumpets, 
\q1 \add And\add* made a great noise to be heard, 
\q1 For a remembrance before the most High. 
\q1
\v 17 Then all the people together hasted, 
\q1 And fell \add down\add* to the earth upon \add their\add* faces 
\q1 To worship their Lord God Almighty, the most High. 
\q1
\v 18 The singers also sang praises with their voices, 
\q1 With great variety of sounds was there made sweet melody. 
\q1
\v 19 And the people besought the Lord, the most High, 
\q1 By prayer before \add him that is\add* merciful, 
\q1 Till the solemnity of the Lord was ended, 
\q1 And they had finished his service. 
\q1
\v 20 Then he went down, and lifted up his hands over the whole congregation of the children of Israel, 
\q1 To give the blessing of the Lord with his lips, 
\q1 And to rejoice in his name. 
\q1
\v 21 And they bowed themselves down to worship the second time, 
\q1 That \add they\add* might receive a blessing from the most High. 
\q1
\v 22 Now therefore bless ye the God of all, 
\q1 Which only doeth wondrous \add things\add* every where, 
\q1 Which exalteth our days from the womb, 
\q1 And dealeth with us according to his mercy. 
\q1
\v 23 He grant us joyfulness of heart, 
\q1 And that peace may be in our days in Israel for ever: 
\q1
\v 24 That \add he\add* would confirm his mercy with us, 
\q1 And deliver us at his time. 
\b
\q1
\v 25  \add There be\add* two \add manner of\add* nations \add which\add* my heart abhorreth, 
\q1 And the third is no nation: 
\q1
\v 26 They that sit upon the mountain of Samaria, 
\q1 And they that dwell amongst the Philistines, 
\q1 And \add that\add* foolish people that dwell in Sichem. 
\b
\mi
\v 27 Jesus the son of Sirach of Jerusalem hath written in this book the instruction of understanding and knowledge, who out of his heart poured forth wisdom. 
\b
\q1
\v 28 Blessed \add is he\add* that shall be exercised in these \add things\add*; 
\q1 And he that layeth them up in his heart shall become wise. 
\q1
\v 29 For if he do them, he shall be strong to all \add things\add*: 
\q1 For the light of the Lord leadeth him, 
\q1 Who giveth wisdom to the godly. 
\q1 Blessed \add be\add* the Lord for ever. Amen, Amen. 
\c 51  
\d
\v 1 A Prayer of Jesus the son of Sirach. 
\q1 I will thank thee, O Lord \add and\add* King, 
\q1 And praise thee, O God my Saviour: 
\q1 I do give praise unto thy name: 
\q1
\v 2 For thou art my defender and helper, 
\q1 And hast preserved my body from destruction, 
\q1 And from the snare of the slanderous tongue, 
\q1 \add And\add* from the lips that forge lies, 
\q1 And hast been my helper against \add mine\add* adversaries: 
\q1
\v 3 And hast delivered me, according to the multitude of \add thy\add* mercies and \add greatness\add* of thy name, 
\q1 From the teeth of \add them that were\add* ready to devour \add me\add*, 
\q1 \add And\add* out of the hands of such as sought after my life, 
\q1 \add And\add* from the manifold afflictions which I had; 
\q1
\v 4 From the choking of fire on every side, 
\q1 And from the midst of the fire which I kindled not; 
\q1
\v 5 From the depth of the belly of hell, 
\q1 From an unclean tongue, and from lying words. 
\q1
\v 6  \add By\add* an accusation to the king from an unrighteous tongue 
\q1 My soul drew near \add even\add* unto death, 
\q1 My life was near to the hell beneath. 
\q1
\v 7 They compassed me on every side, 
\q1 And there was no \add man\add* to help me: 
\q1 I looked for the succour of men, but there was none. 
\q1
\v 8 Then thought I upon thy mercy, O Lord, 
\q1 And \add upon\add* thy acts of old, 
\q1 How thou deliverest such as wait for thee, 
\q1 And savest them out of the hands of the enemies. 
\q1
\v 9 Then lifted I up my supplication from the earth, 
\q1 And prayed for deliverance from death. 
\q1
\v 10 I called upon the Lord, the Father of my Lord, 
\q1 That \add he\add* would not leave me in the days of \add my\add* trouble, 
\q1 \add And\add* in the time of the proud, when there was no help. 
\q1
\v 11 I will praise thy name continually, 
\q1 And will sing praise with thanksgiving; 
\q1 And \add so\add* my prayer was heard: 
\q1
\v 12 For thou savedst me from destruction, 
\q1 And deliveredst me from the evil time: 
\q1 Therefore will I give thanks, and praise thee, 
\q1 And bless thy name, O Lord. 
\q1
\v 13 When I was yet young, or ever I went abroad, 
\q1 I desired wisdom openly in my prayer. 
\q1
\v 14 I prayed for her before the temple, 
\q1 And will seek her out even to the end. 
\q1
\v 15  \add Even\add* from the flower till the grape was ripe 
\q1 Hath my heart delighted in her: 
\q1 My foot went the right way, 
\q1 From my youth up sought I after her. 
\q1
\v 16 I bowed down mine ear a little, and received \add her\add*, 
\q1 And gat much learning. 
\q1
\v 17 I profited therein, 
\q1 \add Therefore\add* will I ascribe the glory unto him that giveth me wisdom. 
\q1
\v 18 For I purposed to do \add after\add* her, 
\q1 And earnestly I followed \add that which is\add* good; 
\q1 So shall I not be confounded. 
\q1
\v 19 My soul hath wrestled with her, 
\q1 And in my doings I was exact: 
\q1 I stretched forth my hands to the \add heaven\add* above, 
\q1 And bewailed \add my\add* ignorances of her. 
\q1
\v 20 I directed my soul unto her, 
\q1 And I found her in pureness: 
\q1 I have had \add my\add* heart joined with her from the beginning, 
\q1 Therefore shall I not be forsaken. 
\q1
\v 21 My heart was troubled in seeking her: 
\q1 Therefore have I gotten a good possession. 
\q1
\v 22 The Lord hath given me a tongue \add for\add* my reward, 
\q1 And I will praise him therewith. 
\q1
\v 23 Draw near unto me, \add you\add* unlearned, 
\q1 And dwell in the house of learning. 
\q1
\v 24 Wherefore are you slow, and what say you of these \add things\add*, 
\q1 Seeing your souls are very thirsty? 
\q1
\v 25 I opened my mouth, and said, 
\q1 Buy \add her\add* for yourselves without money. 
\q1
\v 26 Put your neck under the yoke, 
\q1 And let your soul receive instruction: 
\q1 She is hard at hand to find. 
\q1
\v 27 Behold with your eyes, how that I have had \add but\add* little labour, 
\q1 And have gotten unto me much rest. 
\q1
\v 28 Get learning with a great sum of money, 
\q1 And get much gold by her. 
\q1
\v 29 Let your soul rejoice in his mercy, 
\q1 And be not ashamed of his praise. 
\q1
\v 30 Work your work betimes, 
\q1 And in his time he will give \add you\add* your reward.
