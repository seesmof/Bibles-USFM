\mt2 THE SONG OF THE 
\mt1 THREE HOLY CHILDREN, 
\imi which followeth in the third Chapter of DANIEL after this place,—\it fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace\it*—verse 23. That which followeth is not in the Chaldee, to wit, \it And they walked\it*—unto these words, \it Then Nebuchadnezzar\it*—verse 24.

\v 1  \sc And\sc* they walked in the midst of the fire, praising God, and blessing the Lord. 
\v 2 Then Azarias stood \add up\add*, and prayed on this manner; and opening his mouth in the midst of the fire, said, 
\p
\v 3 Blessed art thou, O Lord God of our fathers: thy name \add is\add* worthy to be praised and glorified for evermore: 
\v 4 for thou art righteous in all \add the things\add* that thou hast done to us: yea, true \add are\add* all thy works, thy ways \add are\add* right, and all thy judgments \add are\add* truth. 
\v 5 In all \add the things\add* that thou hast brought upon us, and upon the holy city of our fathers, \add even\add* Jerusalem, thou hast executed true judgment: for according to truth and judgment didst thou bring all these \add things\add* upon us because of our sins. 
\v 6 For we have sinned and committed iniquity, departing from thee. 
\v 7 In all \add things\add* have we trespassed, and not obeyed thy commandments, nor kept \add them\add*, neither done as thou hast commanded us, that it might go well with us. 
\v 8 Wherefore all that thou hast brought upon us, and every \add thing\add* that thou hast done to us, thou hast done in true judgment. 
\v 9 And thou didst deliver us into the hands of lawless enemies, most hateful forsakers \add of God\add*, and to an unjust king, and the most wicked in all the world. 
\v 10 And now we cannot open our mouths, we are become a shame and reproach to thy servants, and to them that worship thee. 
\v 11 Yet deliver us not up wholly, for thy name’s sake, neither disannul thou thy covenant: 
\v 12 and cause not thy mercy to depart from us, for thy beloved Abraham’s sake, for thy servant Isaac’s sake, and \add for\add* thy holy Israel’s sake; 
\v 13 to whom thou hast spoken and promised, that \add thou\add* wouldest multiply their seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that \add lieth\add* upon the sea shore. 
\v 14 For we, O Lord, are become less than any nation, and be kept under this day in all the world because of our sins. 
\v 15 Neither is there at this time prince, or prophet, or leader, or burnt offering, or sacrifice, or oblation, or incense, or place to sacrifice before thee, and to find mercy. 
\v 16 Nevertheless in a contrite heart and an humble spirit let us be accepted. 
\v 17  \add Like\add* as in the burnt offering of rams and bullocks, and \add like\add* as in ten thousands of fat lambs: so let our sacrifice be in thy sight this day, and \add grant\add* that \add we\add* may wholly go after thee: for they shall not be confounded that put their trust in thee. 
\v 18 And now we follow thee with all \add our\add* heart, we fear thee, and seek thy face. 
\v 19 Put us not to shame: but deal with us after thy lovingkindness, and according to the multitude of thy mercies. 
\v 20 Deliver us also according to thy marvellous works, and give glory to thy name, O Lord: and let all them that do thy servants hurt be ashamed; 
\v 21 and let them be confounded in all \add their\add* power and might, and let their strength be broken; 
\v 22 and let them know that thou art Lord, the only God, and glorious over the whole world. 
\p
\v 23 And the king’s servants, that put them in, ceased not to make the oven hot with rosin, pitch, tow, and small wood; 
\v 24 so that the flame streamed forth above the furnace forty and nine cubits. 
\v 25 And it passed through, and burnt those Chaldeans it found about the furnace. 
\v 26 But the angel of the Lord came down into the oven together with Azarias and his fellows, and smote the flame of the fire out of the oven; 
\v 27 and made the midst of the furnace as \add it had been\add* a moist whistling wind, so that the fire touched them not at all, neither hurt nor troubled them. 
\v 28 Then the three, as out of one mouth, praised, glorified, and blessed God in the furnace, saying, 
\q1
\v 29 Blessed art thou, O Lord God of our fathers: 
\q1 And to be praised and exalted above all for ever. 
\q1
\v 30 And blessed \add is\add* thy glorious and holy name: 
\q1 And to be praised and exalted above all for ever. 
\q1

\q1 And to be praised and glorified above all for ever. 
\q1
\v 32 Blessed art thou that beholdest the depths, 
\q1 \add And\add* sittest upon the cherubims: 
\q1 And to be praised and exalted above all for ever. 
\q1
\v 33 Blessed art thou on the glorious throne of thy kingdom: 
\q1 And to be praised and glorified above all for ever. 
\q1
\v 34 Blessed art thou in the firmament of heaven: 
\q1 And above all to be praised and glorified for ever.
