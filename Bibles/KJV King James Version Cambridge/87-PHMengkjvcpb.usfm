\v 1  \sc Paul\sc*, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy \add our\add* brother, unto Philemon \add our\add* dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer, 
\v 2 and to \add our\add* beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house: 
\v 3 Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
\p
\v 4 I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers, 
\v 5 hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints; 
\v 6 that the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good \add thing\add* which is in you in Christ Jesus. 
\v 7 For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother. 
\v 8 Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient, 
\v 9  \add yet\add* for love’s sake I rather beseech \add thee\add*, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ. 
\v 10 I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds: 
\v 11 which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me: 
\v 12 whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels: 
\v 13 whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel: 
\v 14 but without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as \add it were\add* of necessity, but willingly. 
\v 15 For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever; 
\v 16 not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord? 
\v 17 If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself. 
\v 18 If he hath wronged thee, or oweth \add thee\add* ought, put that on mine account; 
\v 19 I Paul have written \add it\add* with mine own hand, I will repay \add it:\add* albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides. 
\v 20 Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord. 
\v 21 Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say. 
\v 22 But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you. 
\v 23 There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus; 
\v 24 Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers. 
\v 25 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ \add be\add* with your spirit. Amen.
