\v 1  \sc The\sc* burden of the word of the \sc Lord\sc* to Israel by Malachi. 
\q1
\v 2 I have loved you, saith the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\q1 Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? 
\q1 \add Was\add* not Esau Jacob’s brother? saith the \sc Lord\sc*: 
\q1 Yet I loved Jacob, 
\q1
\v 3 And I hated Esau, 
\q1 And laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness. 
\q1
\v 4 Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, 
\q1 But we will return and build the desolate places; 
\q1 Thus saith the \sc Lord\sc* of hosts, 
\q1 They shall build, but I will throw down; 
\q1 And they shall call them, The border of wickedness, 
\q1 And, The people \add against\add* whom the \sc Lord\sc* hath indignation for ever. 
\q1
\v 5 And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, 
\q1 The \sc Lord\sc* will be magnified from the border of Israel. 
\b
\q1
\v 6 A son honoureth \add his\add* father, and a servant his master: 
\q1 If then I \add be\add* a father, where \add is\add* mine honour? 
\q1 And if I \add be\add* a master, where \add is\add* my fear? 
\q1 Saith the \sc Lord\sc* of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. 
\q1 And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name? 
\q1
\v 7  \add Ye\add* offer polluted bread upon mine altar; 
\q1 And ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? 
\q1 In that ye say, The table of the \sc Lord\sc* \add is\add* contemptible. 
\q1
\v 8 And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, \add is it\add* not evil? 
\q1 And if ye offer the lame and sick, \add is it\add* not evil? 
\q1 Offer it now unto thy governor; 
\q1 Will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith the \sc Lord\sc* of hosts. 
\q1
\v 9 And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us: 
\q1 This hath been by your means: 
\q1 Will he regard your persons? saith the \sc Lord\sc* of hosts. 
\q1
\v 10 Who \add is there\add* even among you that would shut the doors \add for nought?\add* 
\q1 Neither do ye kindle \add fire on\add* mine altar for nought. 
\q1 I have no pleasure in you, saith the \sc Lord\sc* of hosts, 
\q1 Neither will I accept an offering at your hand. 
\q1
\v 11 For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same 
\q1 My name \add shall be\add* great among the Gentiles; 
\q1 And in every place incense \add shall be\add* offered unto my name, and a pure offering: 
\q1 For my name \add shall be\add* great among the heathen, saith the \sc Lord\sc* of hosts. 
\q1
\v 12 But ye \add have\add* profaned it, in that ye say, 
\q1 The table of the \sc Lord\sc* \add is\add* polluted; 
\q1 And the fruit thereof, \add even\add* his meat, \add is\add* contemptible. 
\q1
\v 13 Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness \add is it!\add* 
\q1 And ye have snuffed at it, saith the \sc Lord\sc* of hosts; 
\q1 And ye brought \add that which was\add* torn, and the lame, and the sick; 
\q1 Thus ye brought an offering: 
\q1 Should I accept this of your hand? saith the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\q1
\v 14 But cursed \add be\add* the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, 
\q1 And voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt \add thing:\add* 
\q1 For I \add am\add* a great King, saith the \sc Lord\sc* of hosts, 
\q1 And my name \add is\add* dreadful among the heathen. 
\b
\c  2  
\q1
\v 1 And now, O ye priests, this commandment \add is\add* for you. 
\q1
\v 2 If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay \add it\add* to heart, 
\q1 To give glory unto my name, saith the \sc Lord\sc* of hosts, 
\q1 I will even send a curse upon you, and will curse your blessings: 
\q1 Yea, I have cursed them already, because ye do not lay \add it\add* to heart. 
\q1
\v 3 Behold, I \add will\add* corrupt your seed, 
\q1 And spread dung upon your faces, \add even\add* the dung of your solemn feasts; 
\q1 And \add one\add* shall take you away with it. 
\q1
\v 4 And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, 
\q1 That my covenant might be with Levi, saith the \sc Lord\sc* of hosts. 
\q1
\v 5 My covenant was with him of life and peace; 
\q1 And I gave them to him \add for\add* the fear wherewith he feared me, 
\q1 And was afraid before my name. 
\q1
\v 6 The law of truth was in his mouth, 
\q1 And iniquity was not found in his lips: 
\q1 He walked with me in peace and equity, 
\q1 And did turn many away from iniquity. 
\q1
\v 7 For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, 
\q1 And they should seek the law at his mouth: 
\q1 For he \add is\add* the messenger of the \sc Lord\sc* of hosts. 
\q1
\v 8 But ye are departed out of the way; 
\q1 Ye have caused many to stumble at the law; 
\q1 Ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the \sc Lord\sc* of hosts. 
\q1
\v 9 Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, 
\q1 According as ye have not kept my ways, 
\q1 But have been partial in the law. 
\b
\q1
\v 10 Have we not all one father? 
\q1 Hath not one God created us? 
\q1 Why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, 
\q1 By profaning the covenant of our fathers? 
\q1
\v 11 Judah hath dealt treacherously, 
\q1 And an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; 
\q1 For Judah hath profaned the holiness of the \sc Lord\sc* which he loved, 
\q1 And hath married the daughter of a strange god. 
\q1
\v 12 The \sc Lord\sc* will cut off the man that doth this, the master and the scholar, 
\q1 Out of the tabernacles of Jacob, 
\q1 And him that offereth an offering unto the \sc Lord\sc* of hosts. 
\q1
\v 13 And this have ye done again, 
\q1 Covering the altar of the \sc Lord\sc* \add with\add* tears, \add with\add* weeping, and \add with\add* crying out, 
\q1 Insomuch that \add he\add* regardeth not the offering any more, 
\q1 Or receiveth \add it with\add* good will at your hand. 
\q1
\v 14 Yet ye say, Wherefore? 
\q1 Because the \sc Lord\sc* hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, 
\q1 Against whom thou hast dealt treacherously: 
\q1 Yet \add is\add* she thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant. 
\q1
\v 15 And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit. 
\q1 And wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed. 
\q1 Therefore take heed to your spirit, 
\q1 And let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth. 
\q1
\v 16  \add For\add* the \sc Lord\sc*, the God of Israel, saith that he hateth putting away: 
\q1 For \add one\add* covereth violence with his garment, saith the \sc Lord\sc* of hosts: 
\q1 Therefore take heed to your spirit, that ye deal not treacherously. 
\b
\q1
\v 17 Ye have wearied the \sc Lord\sc* with your words. 
\q1 Yet ye say, Wherein have we wearied \add him\add*? 
\q1 When ye say, Every one that doeth evil \add is\add* good in the sight of the \sc Lord\sc*, 
\q1 And he delighteth in them; 
\q1 Or, Where \add is\add* the God of judgment? 
\b
\c  3  
\q1
\v 1 Behold, I \add will\add* send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: 
\q1 And the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, 
\q1 Even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: 
\q1 Behold, he \add shall\add* come, saith the \sc Lord\sc* of hosts. 
\q1
\v 2 But who \add may\add* abide the day of his coming? 
\q1 And who \add shall\add* stand when he appeareth? 
\q1 For he \add is\add* like a refiner’s fire, and like fullers’ sope: 
\q1
\v 3 And he shall sit \add as\add* a refiner and purifier of silver: 
\q1 And he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, 
\q1 That they may offer unto the \sc Lord\sc* an offering in righteousness. 
\q1
\v 4 Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the \sc Lord\sc*, 
\q1 As \add in\add* the days of old, and as \add in\add* former years. 
\q1
\v 5 And I will come near to you to judgment; 
\q1 And I will be a swift witness 
\q1 Against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, 
\q1 And against those that oppress the hireling in \add his\add* wages, 
\q1 The widow, and the fatherless, 
\q1 And that turn aside the stranger \add from his right\add*, and fear not me, 
\q1 Saith the \sc Lord\sc* of hosts. 
\q1
\v 6 For I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*, I change not; 
\q1 Therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed. 
\b
\q1
\v 7 Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances, and have not kept \add them\add*. 
\q1 Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith the \sc Lord\sc* of hosts. 
\q1 But ye said, Wherein shall we return? 
\q1
\v 8 Will a man rob God? Yet ye \add have\add* robbed me. 
\q1 But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? 
\q1 \add In\add* tithes and offerings. 
\q1
\v 9 Ye \add are\add* cursed with a curse: for ye \add have\add* robbed me, 
\q1 \add Even\add* this whole nation. 
\q1
\v 10 Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, 
\q1 That there may be meat in mine house, 
\q1 And prove me now herewith, saith the \sc Lord\sc* of hosts, 
\q1 If I will not open you the windows of heaven, 
\q1 And pour you out a blessing, that \add there shall\add* not \add be room\add* enough \add to receive it\add*. 
\q1
\v 11 And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, 
\q1 And he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; 
\q1 Neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the \sc Lord\sc* of hosts. 
\q1
\v 12 And all nations shall call you blessed: 
\q1 For ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the \sc Lord\sc* of hosts. 
\q1
\v 13 Your words have been stout against me, saith the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\q1 Yet ye say, What have we spoken so much against thee? 
\q1
\v 14 Ye have said, It \add is\add* vain to serve God: 
\q1 And what profit \add is it\add* that we have kept his ordinance, 
\q1 And that we have walked mournfully before the \sc Lord\sc* of hosts? 
\q1
\v 15 And now we call the proud happy; 
\q1 Yea, they that work wickedness are set up; 
\q1 Yea, \add they that\add* tempt God are even delivered. 
\b
\q1
\v 16 Then they that feared the \sc Lord\sc* spake often one to another: 
\q1 And the \sc Lord\sc* hearkened, and heard \add it\add*, 
\q1 And a book of remembrance was written before him 
\q1 For them that feared the \sc Lord\sc*, and that thought upon his name. 
\q1
\v 17 And they shall be mine, saith the \sc Lord\sc* of hosts, 
\q1 In that day when I make \add up my\add* jewels; 
\q1 And I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him. 
\q1
\v 18 Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, 
\q1 Between him that serveth God and \add him\add* that serveth him not. 
\b
\c  4  
\q1
\v 1 For behold, the day cometh, that \add shall\add* burn as an oven; 
\q1 And all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: 
\q1 And the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the \sc Lord\sc* of hosts, 
\q1 That it shall leave them neither root nor branch. 
\q1
\v 2 But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise 
\q1 With healing in his wings; 
\q1 And ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall. 
\q1
\v 3 And ye shall tread down the wicked; 
\q1 For they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet 
\q1 In the day that I \add shall\add* do \add this\add*, saith the \sc Lord\sc* of hosts. 
\b
\q1
\v 4 Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, 
\q1 Which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, 
\q1 \add With\add* the statutes and judgments. 
\b
\q1
\v 5 Behold, I \add will\add* send you Elijah the prophet 
\q1 Before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the \sc Lord\sc*: 
\q1
\v 6 And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, 
\q1 And the heart of the children to their fathers, 
\q1 Lest I come and smite the earth \add with\add* a curse.
