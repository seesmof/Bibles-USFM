\v 1  \sc Now\sc* it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth \add month\add*, in the fifth \add day\add* of the month, as I \add was\add* among the captives by the river of Chebar, \add that\add* the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God. 
\v 2 In the fifth \add day\add* of the month, which \add was\add* the fifth year of king Jehoiachin’s captivity, 
\v 3 the word of the \sc Lord\sc* came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the \sc Lord\sc* was there upon him. 
\p
\v 4 And I looked, and behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness \add was\add* about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire. 
\v 5 Also out of the midst thereof \add came\add* the likeness of four living creatures. And this \add was\add* their appearance; they had the likeness of a man. 
\v 6 And \add every\add* one had four faces, and every one had four wings. 
\v 7 And their feet \add were\add* straight feet; and the sole of their feet \add was\add* like the sole of a calf’s foot: and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass. 
\v 8 And \add they had\add* the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings. 
\v 9 Their wings \add were\add* joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward. 
\v 10 As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle. 
\v 11 Thus \add were\add* their faces: and their wings \add were\add* stretched upward; two \add wings\add* of every one \add were\add* joined one to another, and two covered their bodies. 
\v 12 And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; \add and\add* they turned not when they went. 
\v 13 As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance \add was\add* like burning coals of fire, \add and\add* like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning. 
\v 14 And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning. 
\p
\v 15 Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces. 
\v 16 The appearance of the wheels and their work \add was\add* like unto the colour of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work \add was\add* as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel. 
\v 17 When they went, they went upon their four sides: \add and\add* they turned not when they went. 
\v 18 As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings \add were\add* full \add of\add* eyes round about them four. 
\v 19 And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lift up from the earth, the wheels were lift up. 
\v 20 Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither \add was their\add* spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature \add was\add* in the wheels. 
\v 21 When those went, \add these\add* went; and when those stood, \add these\add* stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature \add was\add* in the wheels. 
\v 22 And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature \add was\add* as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above. 
\v 23 And under the firmament \add were\add* their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this \add side\add*, and every one had two, which covered on that \add side\add*, their bodies. 
\v 24 And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of a host: when they stood, they let down their wings. 
\v 25 And there was a voice from the firmament that \add was\add* over their heads, when they stood, \add and\add* had let down their wings. 
\p
\v 26 And above the firmament that \add was\add* over their heads \add was\add* the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne \add was\add* the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it. 
\v 27 And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about. 
\v 28 As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so \add was\add* the appearance of the brightness round about. This \add was\add* the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the \sc Lord\sc*. And when I saw \add it\add*, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee. 
\v 2 And the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard him that spake unto me. 
\v 3 And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, \add even\add* unto this very day. 
\v 4 For \add they are\add* impudent children and stiff hearted. I do send thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\v 5 And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they \add are\add* a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them. 
\v 6 And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns \add be\add* with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they \add be\add* a rebellious house. 
\v 7 And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they \add are\add* most rebellious. 
\v 8 But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou rebellious like \add that\add* rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee. 
\p
\v 9 And when I looked, behold, a hand \add was\add* sent unto me; and lo, a roll of a book \add was\add* therein; 
\v 10 and he spread it before me; and it \add was\add* written within and without: and \add there was\add* written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe. 
\c 3  
\nb
\v 1 Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel. 
\v 2 So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll. 
\v 3 And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat \add it;\add* and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness. 
\p
\v 4 And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them. 
\v 5 For thou \add art\add* not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language, \add but\add* to the house of Israel; 
\v 6 not to many people of a strange speech and of a hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee. 
\v 7 But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel \add are\add* impudent and hardhearted. 
\v 8 Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads. 
\v 9 As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they \add be\add* a rebellious house. 
\v 10 Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears. 
\v 11 And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear. 
\v 12 Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, \add saying\add*, Blessed \add be\add* the glory of the \sc Lord\sc* from his place. 
\v 13  \add I heard\add* also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing. 
\v 14 So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the \sc Lord\sc* was strong upon me. 
\p
\v 15 Then I came to them of the captivity \add at\add* Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days. 
\v 16 And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the \sc Lord\sc* came unto me, saying, 
\v 17 Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me. 
\v 18 When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked \add man\add* shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand. 
\v 19 Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul. 
\v 20 Again, When a righteous \add man\add* doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand. 
\v 21 Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous \add man\add*, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul. 
\p
\v 22 And the hand of the \sc Lord\sc* was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee. 
\v 23 Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and behold, the glory of the \sc Lord\sc* stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face. 
\v 24 Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house. 
\v 25 But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them: 
\v 26 and I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they \add are\add* a rebellious house. 
\v 27 But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they \add are\add* a rebellious house. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee, and pourtray upon it \add the\add* city, \add even\add* Jerusalem: 
\v 2 and lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and cast a mount against it; set the camp also against it, and set \add battering\add* rams against it round about. 
\v 3 Moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it \add for\add* a wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it. This \add shall be\add* a sign to the house of Israel. 
\p
\v 4 Lie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it: \add according to\add* the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity. 
\v 5 For I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel. 
\v 6 And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy right side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed thee each day for a year. 
\v 7 Therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, and thine arm \add shall be\add* uncovered, and thou shalt prophesy against it. 
\v 8 And behold, I will lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another, till thou hast ended the days of thy siege. 
\p
\v 9 Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentiles, and millet, and fitches, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread thereof, \add according to\add* the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side, three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof. 
\v 10 And thy meat which thou shalt eat \add shall be\add* by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it. 
\v 11 Thou shalt drink also water by measure, the sixth \add part\add* of a hin: from time to time shalt thou drink. 
\v 12 And thou shalt eat it \add as\add* barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it with dung that cometh out of man, in their sight. 
\v 13 And the \sc Lord\sc* said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles, whither I will drive them. 
\v 14 Then said I, Ah Lord \sc God\sc*, behold, my soul \add hath\add* not \add been\add* polluted: for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten \add of\add* that which dieth of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth. 
\v 15 Then he said unto me, Lo, I have given thee cow’s dung for man’s dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith. 
\v 16 Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment: 
\v 17 that they may want bread and water, and be astonied one with another, and consume away for their iniquity. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife, take thee a barber’s rasor, and cause \add it\add* to pass upon thine head and upon thy beard: then take thee balances to weigh, and divide \add the hair\add*. 
\v 2 Thou shalt burn with fire a third \add part\add* in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled: and thou shalt take a third \add part\add*, \add and\add* smite about it with a knife: and a third \add part\add* thou shalt scatter in the wind; and I will draw out a sword after them. 
\v 3 Thou shalt also take thereof a few in number, and bind them in thy skirts. 
\v 4 Then take of them again, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire; \add for\add* thereof shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel. 
\p
\v 5 Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; This \add is\add* Jerusalem: I have set it in the midst of the nations and countries \add that are\add* round about her. 
\v 6 And she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations, and my statutes more than the countries that \add are\add* round about her: for they have refused my judgments, and my statutes, they have not walked in them. 
\v 7 Therefore thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Because ye multiplied more than the nations that \add are\add* round about you, \add and\add* have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept my judgments, neither have done according to the judgments of the nations that \add are\add* round about you; 
\v 8 therefore thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Behold, I, even I, \add am\add* against thee, and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations. 
\v 9 And I will do in thee that which I have not done, and whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of all thine abominations. 
\v 10 Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in thee, and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter into all the winds. 
\v 11 Wherefore, \add as\add* I live, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Surely, because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and with all thine abominations, therefore will I also diminish \add thee;\add* neither shall mine eye spare, neither will I have any pity. 
\v 12 A third \add part\add* of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee: and a third \add part\add* shall fall by the sword round about thee; and I will scatter a third \add part\add* into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them. 
\v 13 Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to rest upon them, and I will be comforted: and they shall know that I the \sc Lord\sc* have spoken \add it\add* in my zeal, when I have accomplished my fury in them. 
\v 14 Moreover I will make thee waste, and a reproach among the nations that \add are\add* round about thee, in the sight of all that pass by. 
\v 15 So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment unto the nations that \add are\add* round about thee, when I shall execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes. I the \sc Lord\sc* have spoken \add it\add*. 
\v 16 When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be for \add their\add* destruction, \add and\add* which I will send to destroy you: and I \add will\add* increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread: 
\v 17 so will I send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave thee; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; and I will bring the sword upon thee. I the \sc Lord\sc* have spoken \add it\add*. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1 And the word of the \sc Lord\sc* came unto me, saying, 
\v 2 Son of man, set thy face towards the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them, 
\v 3 and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord \sc God\sc*; Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc* to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys; Behold, I, \add even\add* I, \add will\add* bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places. 
\v 4 And your altars shall be desolate, and your images shall be broken: and I will cast down your slain \add men\add* before your idols. 
\v 5 And I will lay the dead carcases of the children of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars. 
\v 6 In all your dwelling places the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your images may be cut down, and your works may be abolished. 
\v 7 And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\p
\v 8 Yet will I leave a remnant, that ye may have \add some\add* that shall escape the sword among the nations, when ye shall be scattered through the countries. 
\v 9 And they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations whither they shall be carried captives, because I am broken with their whorish heart, which hath departed from me, and with their eyes, which go a whoring after their idols: and they shall lothe themselves for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations. 
\v 10 And they shall know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*, \add and that\add* I have not said in vain that \add I\add* would do this evil unto them. 
\p
\v 11 Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Smite with thine hand, and stamp with thy foot, and say, Alas for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel: for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence. 
\v 12  \add He\add* that \add is\add* far off shall die of the pestilence; and \add he\add* that \add is\add* near shall fall by the sword; and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine: thus will I accomplish my fury upon them. 
\v 13 Then shall ye know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*, when their slain \add men\add* shall be among their idols round about their altars, upon every high hill, in all the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick oak, the place where they did offer sweet savour to all their idols. 
\v 14 So will I stretch out mine hand upon them, and make the land desolate, yea, more desolate than the wilderness towards Diblath, in all their habitations: and they shall know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1 Moreover the word of the \sc Lord\sc* came unto me, saying, 
\v 2 Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc* unto the land of Israel; An end, the end is come upon the four corners of the land. 
\v 3 Now \add is\add* the end \add come\add* upon thee, and I will send mine anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense upon thee all thine abominations. 
\v 4 And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity: but I will recompense thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\p
\v 5 Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; An evil, an only evil, behold, is come. 
\v 6 An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for thee; behold, it is come. 
\v 7 The morning is come unto thee, O thou that dwellest in the land: the time is come, the day of trouble \add is\add* near, and not the sounding again of the mountains. 
\v 8 Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mine anger upon thee: and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense thee for all thine abominations. 
\v 9 And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations \add that\add* are in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc* that smiteth. 
\v 10 Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth; the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded. 
\v 11 Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them \add shall remain\add*, nor of their multitude, nor of any of theirs: neither \add shall there be\add* wailing for them. 
\v 12 The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath \add is\add* upon all the multitude thereof. 
\v 13 For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they were yet alive: for the vision \add is\add* touching the whole multitude thereof, \add which\add* shall not return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life. 
\p
\v 14 They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none goeth to the battle: for my wrath \add is\add* upon all the multitude thereof. 
\v 15 The sword \add is\add* without, and the pestilence and the famine within: he that \add is\add* in the field shall die with the sword; and he that \add is\add* in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him. 
\v 16 But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one for his iniquity. 
\v 17 All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak \add as\add* water. 
\v 18 They shall also gird \add themselves\add* with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame \add shall be\add* upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads. 
\v 19 They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be removed: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the \sc Lord\sc*: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels: because it is the stumblingblock of their iniquity. 
\p
\v 20 As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they made the images of their abominations \add and\add* of their detestable things therein: therefore have I set it far from them. 
\v 21 And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall pollute it. 
\v 22 My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my secret \add place:\add* for the robbers shall enter into it, and defile it. 
\v 23 Make a chain: for the land is full \add of\add* bloody crimes, and the city is full \add of\add* violence. 
\v 24 Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be defiled. 
\v 25 Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and \add there shall be\add* none. 
\v 26 Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon rumour; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients. 
\v 27 The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth \add month\add*, in the fifth \add day\add* of the month, as I sat in mine house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord \sc God\sc* fell there upon me. 
\v 2 Then I beheld, and lo, a likeness as the appearance of fire: from the appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from his loins even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the colour of amber. 
\v 3 And he put forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of mine head; and the spirit lift me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate that looketh toward the north; where \add was\add* the seat of the image of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy. 
\v 4 And behold, the glory of the God of Israel \add was\add* there, according to the vision that I saw in the plain. 
\p
\v 5 Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the way towards the north. So I lift up mine eyes the way toward the north, and behold, northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry. 
\v 6 He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they do? \add even\add* the great abominations that the house of Israel committeth here, that \add I\add* should go far off from my sanctuary? but turn thee yet again, \add and\add* thou shalt see great\add er\add* abominations. 
\v 7 And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold a hole in the wall. 
\v 8 Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I had digged in the wall, behold a door. 
\v 9 And he said unto me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations that they do here. 
\v 10 So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, pourtrayed upon the wall round about. 
\v 11 And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up. 
\v 12 Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the chambers of his imagery? for they say, The \sc Lord\sc* seeth us not; the \sc Lord\sc* hath forsaken the earth. 
\v 13 He said also unto me, Turn thee yet again, \add and\add* thou shalt see great\add er\add* abominations that they do. 
\p
\v 14 Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the \sc Lord’s\sc* house which \add was\add* towards the north; and behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz. 
\v 15 Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen \add this\add*, O son of man? turn thee yet again, \add and\add* thou shalt see greater abominations than these. 
\v 16 And he brought me into the inner court of the \sc Lord’s\sc* house, and behold, \add at\add* the door of the temple of the \sc Lord\sc*, between the porch and the altar, \add were\add* about five and twenty men, \add with\add* their backs toward the temple of the \sc Lord\sc*, and their faces towards the east; and they worshipped the sun towards the east. 
\v 17 Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen \add this\add*, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that \add they\add* commit the abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land \add with\add* violence, and have returned to provoke me to anger: and lo, they put the branch to their nose. 
\v 18 Therefore will I also deal in fury: mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: and though they cry in mine ears \add with\add* a loud voice, \add yet\add* will I not hear them. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 He cried also in mine ears \add with\add* a loud voice, saying, Cause them that have charge over the city to draw near, even every man \add with\add* his destroying weapon in his hand. 
\v 2 And behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate, which lieth toward the north, and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man among them \add was\add* clothed \add with\add* linen, with a writer’s inkhorn by his side: and they went in, and stood beside the brasen altar. 
\v 3 And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon he was, to the threshold of the house. And he called to the man clothed \add with\add* linen, which \add had\add* the writer’s inkhorn by his side; 
\v 4 and the \sc Lord\sc* said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof. 
\v 5 And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him through the city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity: 
\v 6 slay utterly old \add and\add* young, both maids, and little children, and women: but come not near any man upon whom \add is\add* the mark; and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men which \add were\add* before the house. 
\v 7 And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts \add with\add* the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and slew in the city. 
\p
\v 8 And it came to pass, while they were slaying them, and I \add was\add* left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord \sc God\sc*, \add wilt\add* thou destroy all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon Jerusalem? 
\v 9 Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah \add is\add* exceeding great, and the land is full \add of\add* blood, and the city full \add of\add* perverseness: for they say, The \sc Lord\sc* hath forsaken the earth, and the \sc Lord\sc* seeth not. 
\v 10 And \add as for\add* me also, mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity, \add but\add* I will recompense their way upon their head. 
\v 11 And behold, the man clothed with linen, which \add had\add* the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as thou hast commanded me. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1 Then I looked, and behold, in the firmament that \add was\add* above the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne. 
\v 2 And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, \add even\add* under the cherub, and fill thine hand \add with\add* coals of fire from between the cherubims, and scatter \add them\add* over the city. And he went in in my sight. 
\v 3 Now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court. 
\v 4 Then the glory of the \sc Lord\sc* went up from the cherub, \add and stood\add* over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the \sc Lord’s\sc* glory. 
\v 5 And the sound of the cherubims’ wings was heard \add even\add* to the utter court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh. 
\v 6 And it came to pass, \add that\add* when he had commanded the man clothed with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the cherubims; then he went in, and stood beside the wheels. 
\v 7 And \add one\add* cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto the fire that \add was\add* between the cherubims, and took \add thereof\add*, and put \add it\add* into the hands of \add him that was\add* clothed with linen: who took \add it\add*, and went out. 
\p
\v 8 And there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man’s hand under their wings. 
\v 9 And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubims, one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the appearance of the wheels \add was\add* as the colour of a beryl stone. 
\v 10 And \add as for\add* their appearances, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel. 
\v 11 When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not as they went, but \add to\add* the place whither the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went. 
\v 12 And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, \add were\add* full \add of\add* eyes round about, \add even\add* the wheels that they four had. 
\v 13 As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O wheel. 
\v 14 And \add every\add* one had four faces: the first face \add was\add* the face of a cherub, and the second face \add was\add* the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle. 
\v 15 And the cherubims were lifted up. This \add is\add* the living creature that I saw by the river of Chebar. 
\v 16 And when the cherubims went, the wheels went by them: and when the cherubims lift up their wings to mount up from the earth, the same wheels also turned not from beside them. 
\v 17 When they stood, \add these\add* stood; and when they were lifted up, \add these\add* lift up themselves \add also:\add* for the spirit of the living creature \add was\add* in them. 
\p
\v 18 Then the glory of the \sc Lord\sc* departed from off the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubims. 
\v 19 And the cherubims lift up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also \add were\add* besides them, and \add every one\add* stood \add at\add* the door of the east gate of the \sc Lord’s\sc* house; and the glory of the God of Israel \add was\add* over them above. 
\v 20 This \add is\add* the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Chebar; and I knew that they \add were the\add* cherubims. 
\v 21 Every one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man \add was\add* under their wings. 
\v 22 And the likeness of their faces \add was\add* the same faces which I saw by the river of Chebar, their appearances and themselves: they went every one straight forward. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 Moreover the spirit lift me up, and brought me unto the east gate of the \sc Lord’s\sc* house, which looketh eastward: and behold at the door of the gate five and twenty men; among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people. 
\v 2 Then said he unto me, Son of man, these \add are\add* the men that devise mischief, and give wicked counsel in this city: 
\v 3 which say, \add It is\add* not near; \add let us\add* build houses: this \add city is\add* the caldron, and we \add be\add* the flesh. 
\v 4 Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man. 
\v 5 And the Spirit of the \sc Lord\sc* fell upon me, and said unto me, Speak; Thus saith the \sc Lord\sc*; Thus have ye said, O house of Israel: for I know the things that come into your mind, \add every one of\add* them. 
\v 6 Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled the streets thereof \add with\add* the slain. 
\v 7 Therefore thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they \add are\add* the flesh, and this \add city is\add* the caldron: but \add I\add* will bring you forth out of the midst of it. 
\v 8 Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\v 9 And I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you. 
\v 10 Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of Israel; and ye shall know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\v 11 This \add city\add* shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof; \add but\add* I will judge you in the border of Israel: 
\v 12 and ye shall know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*: for ye have not walked in my statutes, neither executed my judgments, but have done after the manners of the heathen that \add are\add* round about you. 
\p
\v 13 And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried \add with\add* a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord \sc God\sc*, \add wilt\add* thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel? 
\v 14 Again the word of the \sc Lord\sc* came unto me, saying, 
\v 15 Son of man, thy brethren, \add even\add* thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel wholly, \add are\add* they unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get ye far from the \sc Lord\sc*: unto us is this land given in possession. 
\v 16 Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Although I have cast them far off among the heathen, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come. 
\v 17 Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; I will even gather you from the people, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel. 
\v 18 And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence. 
\v 19 And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh: 
\v 20 that they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God. 
\v 21 But \add as for them\add* whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\p
\v 22 Then did the cherubims lift up their wings, and the wheels besides them; and the glory of the God of Israel \add was\add* over them above. 
\v 23 And the glory of the \sc Lord\sc* went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which \add is\add* on the east side of the city. 
\v 24 Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me. 
\v 25 Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that the \sc Lord\sc* had shewed me. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 The word of the \sc Lord\sc* also came unto me, saying, 
\v 2 Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house, which have eyes to see, and see not; they have ears to hear, and hear not: for they \add are\add* a rebellious house. 
\v 3 Therefore thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing, and remove by day in their sight; and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight: it may be they will consider, though they \add be\add* a rebellious house. 
\v 4 Then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for removing: and thou shalt go forth at even in their sight, as they that go forth into captivity. 
\v 5 Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby. 
\v 6 In their sight shalt thou bear \add it\add* upon \add thy\add* shoulders, \add and\add* carry \add it\add* forth in the twilight: thou shalt cover thy face, that thou see not the ground: for I have set thee \add for\add* a sign unto the house of Israel. 
\v 7 And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for captivity, and in the even I digged through the wall with mine hand; I brought \add it\add* forth in the twilight, \add and\add* I bare \add it\add* upon \add my\add* shoulder in their sight. 
\p
\v 8 And in the morning came the word of the \sc Lord\sc* unto me, saying, 
\v 9 Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said unto thee, What doest thou? 
\v 10 Say thou unto them, Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; This burden \add concerneth\add* the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel that \add are\add* among them. 
\v 11 Say, I \add am\add* your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done unto them: they shall remove \add and\add* go into captivity. 
\v 12 And the prince that \add is\add* among them shall bear upon \add his\add* shoulder in the twilight, and shall go forth: they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby: he shall cover his face, that he see not the ground with \add his\add* eyes. 
\v 13 My net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare: and I will bring him to Babylon \add to\add* the land of the Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there. 
\v 14 And I will scatter toward every wind all that \add are\add* about him to help him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword after them. 
\v 15 And they shall know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*, when I shall scatter them among the nations, and disperse them in the countries. 
\v 16 But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations among the heathen whither they come; and they shall know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\p
\v 17 Moreover the word of the \sc Lord\sc* came to me, saying, 
\v 18 Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with trembling and with carefulness; 
\v 19 and say unto the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*, of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, \add and\add* of the land of Israel; They shall eat their bread with carefulness, and drink their water with astonishment, that her land may be desolate from all that is therein, because of the violence of all them that dwell therein. 
\v 20 And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be desolate; and ye shall know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\p
\v 21 And the word of the \sc Lord\sc* came unto me, saying, 
\v 22 Son of man, what \add is\add* that proverb \add that\add* ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision faileth? 
\v 23 Tell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but say unto them, The days are at hand, and the effect of every vision. 
\v 24 For there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel. 
\v 25 For I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*: I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall come to pass; it shall be no more prolonged: for in your days, O rebellious house, will I say the word, and will perform it, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\p
\v 26 Again the word of the \sc Lord\sc* came to me, saying, 
\v 27 Son of man, behold, \add they of\add* the house of Israel say, The vision that he seeth \add is\add* for many days \add to come\add*, and he prophesieth of the times \add that are\add* far off. 
\v 28 Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; There shall none of my words be prolonged any more, but the word which I have spoken shall be done, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 And the word of the \sc Lord\sc* came unto me, saying, 
\v 2 Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own hearts, Hear ye the word of the \sc Lord\sc*; 
\v 3 thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Woe unto the foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing! 
\v 4 O Israel, thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts. 
\v 5 Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\v 6 They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The \sc Lord\sc* saith: and the \sc Lord\sc* hath not sent them: and they have made \add others\add* to hope that \add they\add* would confirm the word. 
\v 7 Have ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a lying divination, whereas ye say, The \sc Lord\sc* saith \add it;\add* albeit I have not spoken? 
\v 8 Therefore thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Because ye have spoken vanity, and seen lies, therefore behold, I \add am\add* against you, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\v 9 And mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and ye shall know that I \add am\add* the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\v 10 Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace; and \add there was\add* no peace; and one built up a wall, and lo, others daubed it \add with\add* untempered \add morter:\add* 
\v 11 say unto them which daub \add it with\add* untempered \add morter\add*, that it shall fall: there shall be an overflowing shower; and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall rent \add it\add*. 
\v 12 Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you, Where \add is\add* the daubing where\add with\add* ye have daubed \add it?\add* 
\v 13 Therefore thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; I will even rent \add it with\add* a stormy wind in my fury; and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger, and great hailstones in \add my\add* fury to consume \add it\add*. 
\v 14 So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed \add with\add* untempered \add morter\add*, and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be discovered, and it shall fall, and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof: and ye shall know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\v 15 Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them that have daubed it \add with\add* untempered \add morter\add*, and will say unto you, The wall \add is\add* no \add more\add*, neither they that daubed it; 
\v 16  \add to wit\add*, the prophets of Israel which prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and which see visions of peace for her, and \add there is\add* no peace, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\p
\v 17 Likewise thou son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people, which prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy thou against them, 
\v 18 and say, Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Woe to \add the women\add* that sew pillows to all armholes, and make kerchiefs upon the head of every stature to hunt souls! Will ye hunt the souls of my people, and will ye save the souls alive \add that come\add* unto you? 
\v 19 And will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hear \add your\add* lies? 
\v 20 Wherefore thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Behold, I \add am\add* against your pillows, where\add with\add* ye there hunt the souls to make \add them\add* fly, and I will tear them from your arms, and will let the souls go, \add even\add* the souls that ye hunt to make \add them\add* fly. 
\v 21 Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted; and ye shall know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\v 22 Because \add with\add* lies \add ye\add* have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that \add he\add* should not return from his wicked way, by promising him life: 
\v 23 therefore ye shall see no more vanity, nor divine divinations: for I will deliver my people out of your hand: and ye shall know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1 Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and sat before me. 
\v 2 And the word of the \sc Lord\sc* came unto me, saying, 
\v 3 Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart, and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face: should I be inquired of at all by them? 
\v 4 Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet; I the \sc Lord\sc* will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols; 
\v 5 that \add I\add* may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols. 
\v 6 Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Repent, and turn \add yourselves\add* from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations. 
\v 7 For every one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger that sojourneth in Israel, which separateth himself from me, and setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to a prophet to inquire of him concerning me; I the \sc Lord\sc* will answer him by myself: 
\v 8 and I will set my face against that man, and will make him a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of my people; and ye shall know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\v 9 And if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the \sc Lord\sc* have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel. 
\v 10 And they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity: the punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that seeketh \add unto him;\add* 
\v 11 that the house of Israel may go no more astray from me, neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\p
\v 12 The word of the \sc Lord\sc* came again to me, saying, 
\v 13 Son of man, when the land sinneth against me by trespassing grievously, then will I stretch out mine hand upon it, and will break the staff of the bread thereof, and will send famine upon it, and will cut off man and beast from it: 
\v 14 though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver \add but\add* their own souls by their righteousness, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\v 15 If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land, and they spoil it, so that it be desolate, that no man may pass through because of the beasts: 
\v 16  \add though\add* these three men \add were\add* in it, \add as\add* I live, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only shall be delivered, but the land shall be desolate. 
\v 17 Or \add if\add* I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword, go through the land; so that I cut off man and beast from it: 
\v 18 though these three men \add were\add* in it, \add as\add* I live, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only shall be delivered themselves. 
\v 19 Or \add if\add* I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my fury upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast: 
\v 20 though Noah, Daniel, and Job, \add were\add* in it, \add as\add* I live, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they shall \add but\add* deliver their own souls by their righteousness. 
\v 21 For thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; How much more when I send my four sore judgments upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the noisome beast, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast? 
\v 22 Yet behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth, \add both\add* sons and daughters: behold, they \add shall\add* come forth unto you, and ye shall see their way and their doings: and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, \add even\add* concerning all that I have brought upon it. 
\v 23 And they shall comfort you, when ye see their ways and their doings: and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1 And the word of the \sc Lord\sc* came unto me, saying, 
\v 2 Son of man, What is the vine tree more than any tree, \add or than\add* a branch which is among the trees of the forest? 
\v 3 Shall wood be taken thereof to do \add any\add* work? or will \add men\add* take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon? 
\v 4 Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burnt. Is it meet for \add any\add* work? 
\v 5 Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less shall it be meet yet for \add any\add* work, when the fire hath devoured it, and it is burned? 
\v 6 Therefore thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
\v 7 And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from \add one\add* fire, and \add another\add* fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*, when I set my face against them. 
\v 8 And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\c 16  
\p
\v 1 Again the word of the \sc Lord\sc* came unto me, saying, 
\v 2 Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations, 
\v 3 and say, Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc* unto Jerusalem; Thy birth and thy nativity \add is\add* of the land of Canaan; thy father \add was\add* an Amorite, and thy mother a Hittite. 
\v 4 And \add as for\add* thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed in water to supple \add thee;\add* thou wast not salted at all, nor swaddled at all. 
\v 5 None eye pitied thee, to do any of these unto thee, to have compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field, to the lothing of thy person, in the day that thou wast born. 
\p
\v 6 And when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own blood, I said unto thee \add when thou wast\add* in thy blood, Live; yea, I said unto thee \add when thou wast\add* in thy blood, Live. 
\v 7 I have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field, and thou hast increased and waxen great, and thou art come to excellent ornaments: \add thy\add* breasts are fashioned, and thine hair is grown, whereas thou \add wast\add* naked and bare. 
\v 8 Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time \add was\add* the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*, and thou becamest mine. 
\v 9 Then washed I thee with water; yea, I throughly washed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil. 
\v 10 I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee \add with\add* badgers’ \add skin\add*, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and I covered thee \add with\add* silk. 
\v 11 I decked thee also \add with\add* ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thine hands, and a chain on thy neck. 
\v 12 And I put a jewel on thy forehead, and earrings in thine ears, and a beautiful crown upon thine head. 
\v 13 Thus wast thou decked \add with\add* gold and silver; and thy raiment \add was of\add* fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; thou didst eat fine flour, and honey, and oil: and thou wast exceeding beautiful, and thou didst prosper into a kingdom. 
\v 14 And thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for it \add was\add* perfect through my comeliness, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\p
\v 15 But thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and playedst the harlot because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy fornications on every one that passed by; his it was. 
\v 16 And of thy garments thou didst take, and deckedst thy high places with divers colours, and playedst the harlot thereupon: \add the like things shall\add* not come, neither shall it be \add so\add*. 
\v 17 Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given thee, and madest to thyself images of men, and didst commit whoredom with them, 
\v 18 and tookest thy broidered garments, and coveredst them: and thou hast set mine oil and mine incense before them. 
\v 19 My meat also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey, \add wherewith\add* I fed thee, thou hast even set it before them for a sweet savour: and \add thus\add* it was, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\v 20 Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured. \add Is this\add* of thy whoredoms a small matter, 
\v 21 that thou hast slain my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass through \add the fire\add* for them? 
\v 22 And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, \add and\add* wast polluted in thy blood. 
\v 23 And it came to pass after all thy wickedness, (woe, woe unto thee! saith the Lord \sc God\sc*;) 
\v 24  \add that\add* thou hast also built unto thee an eminent place, and hast made thee a high place in every street. 
\v 25 Thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way, and hast made thy beauty to be abhorred, and hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by, and multiplied thy whoredoms. 
\v 26 Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours, great of flesh; and hast increased thy whoredoms, to provoke me to anger. 
\v 27 Behold therefore, I have stretched out my hand over thee, and have diminished thine ordinary \add food\add*, and delivered thee unto the will of them that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, which are ashamed of thy lewd way. 
\v 28 Thou hast played the whore also with the Assyrians, because thou wast unsatiable; yea, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet couldest not be satisfied. 
\v 29 Thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of Canaan unto Chaldea; and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith. 
\v 30 How weak is thine heart, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*, seeing thou doest all these \add things\add*, the work of an imperious whorish woman; 
\v 31 in that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way, and makest thine high place in every street; and hast not been as a harlot, in that \add thou\add* scornest hire; 
\v 32  \add but as\add* a wife that committeth adultery, \add which\add* taketh strangers instead of her husband. 
\v 33 They give gifts to all whores: but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers, and hirest them, that \add they\add* may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredom. 
\v 34 And the contrary is in thee from \add other\add* women in thy whoredoms, whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms: and in that thou givest a reward, and no reward is given unto thee, therefore thou art contrary. 
\p
\v 35 Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the \sc Lord\sc*: 
\v 36 thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Because thy filthiness was poured out, and thy nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers, and with all the idols of thy abominations, and by the blood of thy children, which thou didst give unto them; 
\v 37 behold therefore, I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all \add them\add* that thou hast loved, with all \add them\add* that thou hast hated; I will even gather them round about against thee, and will discover thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all thy nakedness. 
\v 38 And I will judge thee, as \add women\add* that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy. 
\v 39 And I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thine eminent place, and shall break down thy high places: they shall strip thee also of thy clothes, and shall take thy fair jewels, and leave thee naked and bare. 
\v 40 They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords. 
\v 41 And they shall burn thine houses with fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women: and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou also shalt give no hire any more. 
\v 42 So will I make my fury towards thee to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry. 
\v 43 Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast fretted me in all these \add things;\add* behold therefore, I also will recompense thy way upon \add thine\add* head, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*: and thou shalt not commit \add this\add* lewdness above all thine abominations. 
\p
\v 44 Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use \add this\add* proverb against thee, saying, As \add is\add* the mother, \add so is\add* her daughter. 
\v 45 Thou \add art\add* thy mother’s daughter, that lotheth her husband and her children; and thou \add art\add* the sister of thy sisters, which lothed their husbands and their children: your mother \add was\add* a Hittite, and your father an Amorite. 
\v 46 And thine elder sister \add is\add* Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand: and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, \add is\add* Sodom and her daughters. 
\v 47 Yet hast thou not walked after their ways, nor done after their abominations: but, as \add if that were\add* a very little \add thing\add*, thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways. 
\v 48  \add As\add* I live, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*, Sodom thy sister hath not done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters. 
\v 49 Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. 
\v 50 And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw \add good\add*. 
\v 51 Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done. 
\v 52 Thou also, which hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own shame for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they: they are more righteous than thou: yea, be thou confounded also, and bear thy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters. 
\p
\v 53 When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then \add will I bring again\add* the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them: 
\v 54 that thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them. 
\v 55 When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate, then thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate. 
\v 56 For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride, 
\v 57 before thy wickedness was discovered, as \add at\add* the time of \add thy\add* reproach of the daughters of Syria, and all \add that are\add* round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, which despise thee round about. 
\v 58 Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\v 59 For thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; I will even deal with thee as thou hast done, which hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant. 
\v 60 Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant. 
\v 61 Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger: and I will give them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant. 
\v 62 And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*: 
\v 63 that thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more, because of thy shame, when I am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\c 17  
\p
\v 1 And the word of the \sc Lord\sc* came unto me, saying, 
\v 2 Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable unto the house of Israel; 
\v 3 and say, Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; A great eagle with great wings, longwinged, full \add of\add* feathers, which had divers colours, came unto Lebanon, and took the highest branch of the cedar: 
\v 4 he cropt off the top of his young twigs, and carried it into a land of traffick; he set it in a city of merchants. 
\v 5 He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful field; he placed \add it\add* by great waters, \add and\add* set it \add as\add* a willow tree. 
\v 6 And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and the roots thereof were under him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs. 
\v 7 There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers: and behold, this vine did bend her roots toward him, and shot forth her branches toward him, that \add he\add* might water it by the furrows of her plantation. 
\v 8 It \add was\add* planted in a good soil by great waters, that \add it\add* might bring forth branches, and that \add it\add* might bear fruit, that \add it\add* might be a goodly vine. 
\v 9 Say thou, Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Shall it prosper? shall he not pull up the roots thereof, and cut off the fruit thereof, that it wither? it shall wither \add in\add* all the leaves of her spring, even without great power or many people to pluck it up by the roots thereof. 
\v 10 Yea behold, \add being\add* planted, shall it prosper? shall it not utterly wither, when the east wind toucheth it? it shall wither in the furrows where it grew. 
\p
\v 11 Moreover the word of the \sc Lord\sc* came unto me, saying, 
\v 12 Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these \add things mean?\add* tell \add them\add*, Behold, the king of Babylon is come \add to\add* Jerusalem, and hath taken the king thereof, and the princes thereof, and led them with him to Babylon; 
\v 13 and hath taken of the king’s seed, and made a covenant with him, and hath taken an oath of him: he hath also taken the mighty of the land: 
\v 14 that the kingdom might be base, that \add it\add* might not lift itself up, \add but\add* that by keeping of his covenant it might stand. 
\v 15 But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors \add into\add* Egypt, that \add they\add* might give him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that doeth such \add things?\add* or shall he break the covenant, and be delivered? 
\v 16  \add As\add* I live, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*, surely in the place \add where\add* the king \add dwelleth\add* that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he brake, \add even\add* with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die. 
\v 17 Neither shall Pharaoh with \add his\add* mighty army and great company make for him in the war, by casting up mounts, and building forts, to cut off many persons: 
\v 18 seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when lo, he had given his hand, and hath done all these \add things\add*, he shall not escape. 
\v 19 Therefore thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; \add As\add* I live, surely mine oath that he hath despised, and my covenant that he hath broken, even it will I recompense upon his own head. 
\v 20 And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will plead with him there \add for\add* his trespass that he hath trespassed against me. 
\v 21 And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword, and they that remain shall be scattered towards all winds: and ye shall know that I the \sc Lord\sc* have spoken \add it\add*. 
\p
\v 22 Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; I will also take of the highest branch of the high cedar, and will set \add it;\add* I will crop off from the top of his young twigs a tender one, and will plant \add it\add* upon a high mountain and eminent: 
\v 23 in the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it: and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar: and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing; in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell. 
\v 24 And all the trees of the field shall know that I the \sc Lord\sc* have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish: I the \sc Lord\sc* have spoken and have done \add it\add*. 
\c 18  
\p
\v 1 And the word of the \sc Lord\sc* came unto me again, saying, 
\v 2 What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge? 
\v 3  \add As\add* I live, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*, ye shall not have \add occasion\add* any more to use this proverb in Israel. 
\v 4 Behold, all souls \add are\add* mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son \add is\add* mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die. 
\p
\v 5 But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right, 
\v 6  \add and\add* hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath defiled his neighbour’s wife, neither hath come near to a menstruous woman, 
\v 7 and hath not oppressed any, \add but\add* hath restored \add to\add* the debtor his pledge, hath spoiled none by violence, hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment; 
\v 8 he \add that\add* hath not given forth upon usury, neither hath taken any increase, \add that\add* hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, hath executed true judgment between man and man, 
\v 9 hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept my judgments, to deal truly; he \add is\add* just, he shall surely live, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\p
\v 10 If he beget a son \add that is\add* a robber, a shedder of blood, and \add that\add* doeth the like to \add any\add* one of these \add things\add*, 
\v 11 and that doeth not any of those \add duties\add*, but even hath eaten upon the mountains, and defiled his neighbour’s wife, 
\v 12 hath oppressed the poor and needy, hath spoiled by violence, hath not restored the pledge, and hath lift up his eyes to the idols, hath committed abomination, 
\v 13 hath given forth upon usury, and hath taken increase: shall he then live? he shall not live: he hath done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him. 
\p
\v 14 Now lo, \add if\add* he beget a son, that seeth all his father’s sins which he hath done, and considereth, and doeth not such like, 
\v 15  \add that\add* hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, hath not defiled his neighbour’s wife, 
\v 16 neither hath oppressed any, hath not withholden the pledge, neither hath spoiled by violence, \add but\add* hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment, 
\v 17  \add that\add* hath taken off his hand from the poor, \add that\add* hath not received usury nor increase, hath executed my judgments, hath walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall surely live. 
\v 18  \add As for\add* his father, because he cruelly oppressed, spoiled \add his\add* brother by violence, and did \add that\add* which \add is\add* not good among his people, lo, even he shall die in his iniquity. 
\p
\v 19 Yet say ye, Why? doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father? When the son hath done that which is lawful and right, \add and\add* hath kept all my statutes, and hath done them, he shall surely live. 
\v 20 The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him. 
\v 21 But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die. 
\v 22 All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be mentioned unto him: in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live. 
\v 23 Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the Lord \sc God\sc*: \add and\add* not that he should return from his ways, and live? 
\p
\v 24 But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, \add and\add* doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked \add man\add* doeth, shall he live? All his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned: in his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die. 
\v 25 Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. Hear now, O house of Israel; Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal? 
\v 26 When a righteous \add man\add* turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and dieth in them; for his iniquity that he hath done shall he die. 
\v 27 Again, when the wicked \add man\add* turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive. 
\v 28 Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die. 
\v 29 Yet saith the house of Israel, The way of the Lord is not equal. O house of Israel, are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal? 
\p
\v 30 Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. Repent, and turn \add yourselves\add* from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin. 
\v 31 Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel? 
\v 32 For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*: wherefore turn \add yourselves\add*, and live ye. 
\c 19  
\p
\v 1 Moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel, 
\v 2 and say, What \add is\add* thy mother? A lioness: she lay down among lions, she nourished her whelps among young lions. 
\v 3 And she brought up one of her whelps: it became a young lion, and it learned to catch the prey; it devoured men. 
\v 4 The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit, and they brought him with chains unto the land of Egypt. 
\v 5 Now when she saw that she had waited, \add and\add* her hope was lost, then she took another of her whelps, \add and\add* made him a young lion. 
\v 6 And he went up and down among the lions, he became a young lion, and learned to catch the prey, \add and\add* devoured men. 
\v 7 And he knew their desolate palaces, and he laid waste their cities; and the land was desolate, and the fulness thereof, by the noise of his roaring. 
\v 8 Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces, and spread their net over him: he was taken in their pit. 
\v 9 And they put him in ward in chains, and brought him to the king of Babylon: they brought him into holds, that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel. 
\p
\v 10 Thy mother \add is\add* like a vine in thy blood, planted by the waters: she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters. 
\v 11 And she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule, and her stature was exalted among the thick branches, and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches. 
\v 12 But she was plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up her fruit: her strong rods were broken and withered; the fire consumed them. 
\v 13 And now she \add is\add* planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty ground. 
\v 14 And fire is gone out of a rod of her branches, \add which\add* hath devoured her fruit, so that she hath no strong rod \add to be\add* a sceptre to rule. This \add is\add* a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation. 
\c 20  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth \add month\add*, the tenth \add day\add* of the month, \add that\add* certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the \sc Lord\sc*, and sat before me. 
\v 2 Then came the word of the \sc Lord\sc* unto me, saying, 
\v 3 Son of man, speak unto the elders of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Are ye come to inquire of me? \add As\add* I live, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*, I will not be inquired of by you. 
\v 4 Wilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt thou judge \add them?\add* cause them to know the abominations of their fathers: 
\v 5 and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; In the day when I chose Israel, and lifted up mine hand unto the seed of the house of Jacob, and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt, when I lifted up mine hand unto them, saying, I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc* your God; 
\v 6 in the day \add that\add* I lifted up mine hand unto them, to bring them forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them, flowing with milk and honey, which \add is\add* the glory of all lands: 
\v 7 then said I unto them, Cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc* your God. 
\v 8 But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me: they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt: then I said, \add I\add* will pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt. 
\v 9 But I wrought for my name’s sake, that \add it\add* should not be polluted before the heathen, among whom they \add were\add*, in whose sight I made myself known unto them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt. 
\v 10 Wherefore I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness. 
\v 11 And I gave them my statutes, and shewed them my judgments, which \add if\add* a man do, he shall even live in them. 
\v 12 Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that \add they\add* might know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc* that sanctify them. 
\v 13 But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they despised my judgments, which \add if\add* a man do, he shall even live in them; and my sabbaths they greatly polluted: then I said, \add I\add* would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness, to consume them. 
\v 14 But I wrought for my name’s sake, that \add it\add* should not be polluted before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them out. 
\v 15 Yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness, that \add I\add* would not bring them into the land which I had given \add them\add*, flowing with milk and honey, which \add is\add* the glory of all lands; 
\v 16 because they despised my judgments, and walked not in my statutes, but polluted my sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols. 
\v 17 Nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them, neither did I make an end of them in the wilderness. 
\v 18 But I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols: 
\v 19 I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc* your God; walk in my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them; 
\v 20 and hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that \add ye\add* may know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc* your God. 
\v 21 Notwithstanding the children rebelled against me: they walked not in my statutes, neither kept my judgments to do them, which \add if\add* a man do, he shall even live in them; they polluted my sabbaths: then I said, \add I\add* would pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness. 
\v 22 Nevertheless I withdrew mine hand, and wrought for my name’s sake, that \add it\add* should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen, in whose sight I brought them forth. 
\v 23 I lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness, that \add I\add* would scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them through the countries; 
\v 24 because they had not executed my judgments, but had despised my statutes, and had polluted my sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers’ idols. 
\v 25 Wherefore I gave them also statutes \add that were\add* not good, and judgments whereby they should not live; 
\v 26 and I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through \add the fire\add* all that openeth the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\p
\v 27 Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Yet \add in\add* this your fathers have blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me. 
\v 28  \add For\add* when I had brought them into the land, \add for\add* the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to them, then they saw every high hill, and all the thick trees, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering: there also they made their sweet savour, and poured out there their drink offerings. 
\v 29 Then I said unto them, What \add is\add* the high place whereunto ye go? And the name thereof is called Bamah unto this day. 
\v 30 Wherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Are ye polluted after the manner of your fathers? and commit ye whoredom after their abominations? 
\v 31 For when \add ye\add* offer your gifts, when \add ye\add* make your sons to pass through the fire, ye pollute yourselves with all your idols, \add even\add* unto \add this\add* day: and shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? \add As\add* I live, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*, I will not be inquired of by you. 
\p
\v 32 And that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all, that ye say, We will be as the heathen, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone. 
\v 33  \add As\add* I live, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*, surely with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out, will I rule over you: 
\v 34 and I will bring you out from the people, and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out. 
\v 35 And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and there will I plead with you face to face. 
\v 36 Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I plead with you, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\v 37 And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant: 
\v 38 and I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me: I will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and ye shall know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\v 39 As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Go ye, serve ye every one his idols, and hereafter \add also\add*, if ye will not hearken unto me: but pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts, and with your idols. 
\v 40 For in mine holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*, there shall all the house of Israel, all of them in the land, serve me: there will I accept them, and there will I require your offerings, and the firstfruits of your oblations, with all your holy \add things\add*. 
\v 41 I will accept you with \add your\add* sweet savour, when I bring you out from the people, and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you before the heathen. 
\v 42 And ye shall know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*, when I shall bring you into the land of Israel, into the country \add for\add* the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to your fathers. 
\v 43 And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein ye have been defiled; and ye shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed. 
\v 44 And ye shall know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*, when I have wrought with you for my name’s sake, not according to your wicked ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O ye house of Israel, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\p
\v 45 Moreover the word of the \sc Lord\sc* came unto me, saying, 
\v 46 Son of man, set thy face toward the south, and drop \add thy word\add* toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south field; 
\v 47 and say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the \sc Lord\sc*; Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Behold, I \add will\add* kindle a fire in thee, and it shall devour every green tree in thee, and every dry tree: the flaming flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shall be burnt therein. 
\v 48 And all flesh shall see that I the \sc Lord\sc* have kindled it: it shall not be quenched. 
\v 49 Then said I, Ah Lord \sc God\sc*, they say of me, Doth he not speak parables? 
\c 21  
\p
\v 1 And the word of the \sc Lord\sc* came unto me, saying, 
\v 2 Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop \add thy word\add* toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel, 
\v 3 and say to the land of Israel, Thus saith the \sc Lord\sc*; Behold, I \add am\add* against thee, and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked. 
\v 4 Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south \add to\add* the north: 
\v 5 that all flesh may know that I the \sc Lord\sc* have drawn forth my sword out of his sheath: it shall not return any more. 
\v 6 Sigh therefore, thou son of man, with the breaking of \add thy\add* loins; and with bitterness sigh before their eyes. 
\v 7 And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou? that thou shalt answer, For the tidings; because it cometh: and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak \add as\add* water: behold, it cometh, and shall be brought to pass, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\p
\v 8 Again the word of the \sc Lord\sc* came unto me, saying, 
\v 9 Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the \sc Lord\sc*; Say, A sword, a sword is sharpened, and also furbished: 
\v 10 it is sharpened to make a sore slaughter; \add it is\add* furbished that it may glitter: should we then make mirth? it contemneth the rod of my son, \add as\add* every tree. 
\v 11 And he hath given it to be furbished, that \add it\add* may be handled: this sword is sharpened, and it \add is\add* furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer. 
\v 12 Cry and howl, son of man: for it shall be upon my people, it \add shall be\add* upon all the princes of Israel: terrors by reason of the sword shall be upon my people: smite therefore upon \add thy\add* thigh. 
\v 13 Because \add it is\add* a trial, and what if \add the sword\add* contemn even the rod? it shall be no \add more\add*, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\v 14 Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite \add thine\add* hands together, and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the slain: it \add is\add* the sword of the great \add men that are\add* slain, which entereth into their privy chambers. 
\v 15 I have set the point of the sword against all their gates, that \add their\add* heart may faint, and \add their\add* ruins be multiplied: ah, \add it is\add* made bright, \add it is\add* wrapt up for the slaughter. 
\v 16 Go thee one way or other, \add either\add* on the right hand, \add or\add* on the left, whithersoever thy face \add is\add* set. 
\v 17 I will also smite mine hands together, and I will cause my fury to rest: I the \sc Lord\sc* have said \add it\add*. 
\p
\v 18 The word of the \sc Lord\sc* came unto me again, saying, 
\v 19 Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come: both twain shall come forth out of one land: and choose thou a place, choose \add it\add*, at the head of the way to the city. 
\v 20 Appoint a way, that the sword may come to Rabbath of the Ammonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem the defenced. 
\v 21 For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made \add his\add* arrows bright, he consulted with images, he looked in the liver. 
\v 22 At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to appoint \add battering\add* rams against the gates, to cast a mount, \add and\add* to build a fort. 
\v 23 And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight, to them that have sworn oaths: but he will call to remembrance the iniquity, that \add they\add* may be taken. 
\v 24 Therefore thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are discovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because, \add I say\add*, that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand. 
\p
\v 25 And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity \add shall have\add* an end, 
\v 26 thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Remove the diadem, and take off the crown: this \add shall\add* not \add be\add* the same: exalt \add him that is\add* low, and abase \add him that is\add* high. 
\v 27 I will overturn, overturn, overturn it: and it shall be no \add more\add*, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it \add him\add*. 
\p
\v 28 And thou, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc* concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their reproach; even say thou, The sword, the sword \add is\add* drawn: for the slaughter \add it is\add* furbished, to consume because of the glittering: 
\v 29 whiles \add they\add* see vanity unto thee, whiles \add they\add* divine a lie unto thee, to bring thee upon the necks of \add them that are\add* slain of the wicked, whose day is come, when \add their\add* iniquity \add shall have\add* an end. 
\v 30 Shall I cause \add it\add* to return into his sheath? I will judge thee in the place where thou wast created, in the land of thy nativity. 
\v 31 And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee, I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath, and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men, \add and\add* skilful to destroy. 
\v 32 Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land; thou shalt be no \add more\add* remembered: for I the \sc Lord\sc* have spoken \add it\add*. 
\c 22  
\p
\v 1 Moreover the word of the \sc Lord\sc* came unto me, saying, 
\v 2 Now, thou son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloody city? yea, thou shalt shew her all her abominations. 
\v 3 Then say thou, Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*, The city sheddeth blood in the midst of it, that her time may come, and maketh idols against herself to defile \add herself\add*. 
\v 4 Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed; and hast defiled \add thyself\add* in thine idols which thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come \add even\add* unto thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the heathen, and a mocking to all countries. 
\v 5  \add Those that be\add* near, and \add those that be\add* far from thee, shall mock thee, \add which art\add* infamous \add and\add* much vexed. 
\v 6 Behold, the princes of Israel, every one were in thee to their power to shed blood. 
\v 7 In thee have they set light by father and mother: in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger: in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow. 
\v 8 Thou hast despised mine holy \add things\add*, and hast profaned my sabbaths. 
\v 9 In thee are men that carry tales to shed blood: and in thee they eat upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they commit lewdness. 
\v 10 In thee have they discovered their father’s nakedness: in thee have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution. 
\v 11 And one hath committed abomination with his neighbour’s wife; and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and another in thee hath humbled his sister, his father’s daughter. 
\v 12 In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou hast taken usury and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\v 13 Behold therefore, I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made, and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of thee. 
\v 14 Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with thee? I the \sc Lord\sc* have spoken \add it\add*, and will do \add it\add*. 
\v 15 And I will scatter thee among the heathen, and disperse thee in the countries, and will consume thy filthiness out of thee. 
\v 16 And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of the heathen, and thou shalt know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\p
\v 17 And the word of the \sc Lord\sc* came unto me, saying, 
\v 18 Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become dross: all they \add are\add* brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are \add even the\add* dross \add of\add* silver. 
\v 19 Therefore thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Because ye are all become dross, behold therefore, I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem. 
\v 20  \add As they\add* gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt \add it;\add* so will I gather \add you\add* in mine anger and in my fury, and I will leave \add you there\add*, and melt you. 
\v 21 Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof. 
\v 22 As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I the \sc Lord\sc* have poured out my fury upon you. 
\p
\v 23 And the word of the \sc Lord\sc* came unto me, saying, 
\v 24 Son of man, say unto her, Thou \add art\add* the land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation. 
\v 25  \add There is\add* a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they have made her many widows in the midst thereof. 
\v 26 Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy \add things:\add* they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they shewed \add difference\add* between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them. 
\v 27 Her princes in the midst thereof \add are\add* like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, \add and\add* to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain. 
\v 28 And her prophets have daubed them \add with\add* untempered \add morter\add*, seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*, when the \sc Lord\sc* hath not spoken. 
\v 29 The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yea, they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully. 
\v 30 And I sought for a man among them, that \add should\add* make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that \add I\add* should not destroy it: but I found none. 
\v 31 Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed upon their heads, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\c 23  
\p
\v 1 The word of the \sc Lord\sc* came again unto me, saying, 
\v 2 Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother: 
\v 3 and they committed whoredoms in Egypt; they committed whoredoms in their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and there they bruised the teats of their virginity. 
\v 4 And the names of them \add were\add* Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister: and they were mine, and they bare sons and daughters. Thus \add were\add* their names; Samaria \add is\add* Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah. 
\p
\v 5 And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians \add her\add* neighbours, 
\v 6  \add which were\add* clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses. 
\v 7 Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, \add with\add* all them \add that were\add* the chosen men of Assyria, and with all \add on\add* whom she doted: with all their idols she defiled herself. 
\v 8 Neither left she her whoredoms \add brought\add* from Egypt: for in her youth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured their whoredom upon her. 
\v 9 Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted. 
\v 10 These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous among women; for they had executed judgment upon her. 
\p
\v 11 And when her sister Aholibah saw \add this\add*, she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms more than her sister in \add her\add* whoredoms. 
\v 12 She doted upon the Assyrians \add her\add* neighbours, captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men. 
\v 13 Then I saw that she was defiled, \add that\add* they took both one way, 
\v 14 and \add that\add* she increased her whoredoms: for when she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed with vermilion, 
\v 15 girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, \add after\add* the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity: 
\v 16 and as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea. 
\v 17 And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her mind was alienated from them. 
\v 18 So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her sister. 
\v 19 Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt. 
\v 20 For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh \add is as\add* the flesh of asses, and whose issue \add is like\add* the issue of horses. 
\v 21 Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth. 
\p
\v 22 Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy mind is alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side; 
\v 23 the Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, all the Assyrians with them: all of them desirable young men, captains and rulers, great lords and renowned, all of them riding upon horses. 
\v 24 And they shall come against thee \add with\add* chariots, wagons, and wheels, and with an assembly of people, \add which\add* shall set against thee buckler and shield and helmet round about: and I will set judgment before them, and they shall judge thee according to their judgments. 
\v 25 And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal furiously with thee: they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and thy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire. 
\v 26 They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels. 
\v 27 Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy whoredom \add brought\add* from the land of Egypt: so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more. 
\v 28 For thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Behold, I \add will\add* deliver thee into the hand \add of them\add* whom thou hatest, into the hand \add of them\add* from whom thy mind is alienated: 
\v 29 and they shall deal with thee hatefully, and shall take \add away\add* all thy labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare: and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms. 
\v 30  \add I will\add* do these \add things\add* unto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen, \add and\add* because thou art polluted with their idols. 
\v 31 Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give her cup into thine hand. 
\v 32 Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Thou shalt drink \add of\add* thy sister’s cup deep and large: thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision; \add it\add* containeth much. 
\v 33 Thou shalt be filled \add with\add* drunkenness and sorrow, \add with\add* the cup of astonishment and desolation, \add with\add* the cup of thy sister Samaria. 
\v 34 Thou shalt even drink it and suck \add it\add* out, and thou shalt break the sheards thereof, and pluck off thine own breasts: for I have spoken \add it\add*, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\v 35 Therefore thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms. 
\p
\v 36 The \sc Lord\sc* said moreover unto me; Son of man, wilt thou judge Aholah and Aholibah? yea, declare unto them their abominations; 
\v 37 that they have committed adultery, and blood \add is\add* in their hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery, and have also caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass for them through \add the fire\add*, to devour \add them\add*. 
\v 38 Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths. 
\v 39 For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and lo, thus have they done in the midst of mine house. 
\v 40 And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far, unto whom a messenger \add was\add* sent; and lo, they came: for whom thou didst wash \add thyself\add*, paintedst thy eyes, and deckedst thyself with ornaments, 
\v 41 and satest upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before it, whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil. 
\v 42 And a voice of a multitude being at ease \add was\add* with her: and with the men of the common sort \add were\add* brought Sabeans from the wilderness, which put bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful crowns upon their heads. 
\v 43 Then said I unto \add her that was\add* old \add in\add* adulteries, Will they now commit whoredoms with her, and she \add with them?\add* 
\v 44 Yet they went in unto her, as \add they\add* go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot: so went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah, the lewd women. 
\p
\v 45 And \add the\add* righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of \add women\add* that shed blood; because they \add are\add* adulteresses, and blood \add is\add* in their hands. 
\v 46 For thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; \add I will\add* bring up a company upon them, and \add will\add* give them to be removed and spoiled. 
\v 47 And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire. 
\v 48 Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness. 
\v 49 And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols: and ye shall know that I \add am\add* the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\c 24  
\p
\v 1 Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth \add day\add* of the month, the word of the \sc Lord\sc* came unto me, saying, 
\v 2 Son of man, write thee the name of the day, \add even\add* of this same day: the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day. 
\v 3 And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Set on a pot, set \add it\add* on, and also pour water into it: 
\v 4 gather the pieces thereof into it, \add even\add* every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill \add it with\add* the choice bones. 
\v 5 Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it, \add and\add* make it boil well, and let them seethe the bones of it therein. 
\p
\v 6 Wherefore thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum \add is\add* therein, and whose scum is not gone out of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall upon it. 
\v 7 For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of a rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust; 
\v 8 that \add it\add* might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set her blood upon the top of a rock, that \add it\add* should not be covered. 
\v 9 Therefore thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Woe to the bloody city! I will even make the pile for fire great. 
\v 10 Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burnt. 
\v 11 Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it may be hot, and may burn, and \add that\add* the filthiness of it may be molten in it, \add that\add* the scum of it may be consumed. 
\v 12 She hath wearied \add herself with\add* lies, and her great scum went not forth out of her: her scum \add shall be\add* in the fire. 
\v 13 In thy filthiness \add is\add* lewdness: because I have purged thee, and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee. 
\v 14 I the \sc Lord\sc* have spoken \add it:\add* it shall come to pass, and I will do \add it;\add* I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge thee, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\p
\v 15 Also the word of the \sc Lord\sc* came unto me, saying, 
\v 16 Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke: yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down. 
\v 17 Forbear to cry, make no mourning \add for\add* the dead, bind the tire of thine head upon thee, and put on thy shoes upon thy feet, and cover not \add thy\add* lips, and eat not the bread of men. 
\v 18 So I spake unto the people in the morning: and at even my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded. 
\p
\v 19 And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these \add things are\add* to us, that thou doest \add so?\add* 
\v 20 Then I answered them, The word of the \sc Lord\sc* came unto me, saying, 
\v 21 Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Behold, I \add will\add* profane my sanctuary, the excellency of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pitieth; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left shall fall by the sword. 
\v 22 And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover \add your\add* lips, nor eat the bread of men. 
\v 23 And your tires \add shall be\add* upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall pine away for your iniquities, and mourn one towards another. 
\v 24 Thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign: according to all that he hath done shall ye do: and when this cometh, ye shall know that I \add am\add* the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\p
\v 25 Also, thou son of man, \add shall it\add* not \add be\add* in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their minds, their sons and their daughters, 
\v 26  \add that\add* he that escapeth in that day shall come unto thee, to cause \add thee\add* to hear \add it\add* with \add thine\add* ears? 
\v 27 In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped, and thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb: and thou shalt be a sign unto them; and they shall know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\c 25  
\p
\v 1 The word of the \sc Lord\sc* came again unto me, saying, 
\v 2 Son of man, set thy face against the Ammonites, and prophesy against them; 
\v 3 and say unto the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord \sc God\sc*; Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Because thou saidst, Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity; 
\v 4 behold therefore, I \add will\add* deliver thee to the men of the east for a possession, and they shall set their palaces in thee, and make their dwellings in thee: they shall eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy milk. 
\v 5 And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the Ammonites a couching place for flocks: and ye shall know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\v 6 For thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Because thou hast clapped \add thine\add* hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced in heart with all thy despite against the land of Israel; 
\v 7 behold therefore, I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to the heathen; and I will cut thee off from the people, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries: I will destroy thee; and thou shalt know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\p
\v 8 Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Because that Moab and Seir do say, Behold, the house of Judah \add is\add* like unto all the heathen; 
\v 9 therefore behold, I \add will\add* open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities \add which are\add* on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim, 
\v 10 unto the men of the east with the Ammonites, and will give them in possession, that the Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations. 
\v 11 And I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\p
\v 12 Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Because that Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them; 
\v 13 therefore thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; I will also stretch out mine hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword. 
\v 14 And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel: and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my fury; and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\p
\v 15 Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart, to destroy \add it for\add* the old hatred; 
\v 16 therefore thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Behold, I \add will\add* stretch out mine hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethims, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast. 
\v 17 And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes, and they shall know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*, when I shall lay my vengeance upon them. 
\c 26  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first \add day\add* of the month, \add that\add* the word of the \sc Lord\sc* came unto me, saying, 
\v 2 Son of man, because that Tyrus hath said against Jerusalem, Aha, she is broken \add that was\add* the gates of the people: she is turned unto me: I shall be replenished, \add now\add* she is laid waste: 
\v 3 therefore thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Behold, I \add am\add* against thee, O Tyrus, and will cause many nations to come up against thee, as the sea causeth his waves to come up. 
\v 4 And they shall destroy the walls of Tyrus, and break down her towers: I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her like the top of a rock. 
\v 5 It shall be \add a place for\add* the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea: for I have spoken \add it\add*, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*: and it shall become a spoil to the nations. 
\v 6 And her daughters which \add are\add* in the field shall be slain by the sword; and they shall know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\p
\v 7 For thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Behold, I \add will\add* bring upon Tyrus Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, a king of kings, from the north, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and companies, and much people. 
\v 8 He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field: and he shall make a fort against thee, and cast a mount against thee, and lift up the buckler against thee. 
\v 9 And he shall set engines of war against thy walls, and with his axes he shall break down thy towers. 
\v 10 By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover thee: thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the wheels, and of the chariots, when he shall enter into thy gates, as men enter into a city wherein is made a breach. 
\v 11 With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets: he shall slay thy people by the sword, and thy strong garrisons shall go down to the ground. 
\v 12 And they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey of thy merchandise: and they shall break down thy walls, and destroy thy pleasant houses: and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the water. 
\v 13 And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease; and the sound of thy harps shall be no more heard. 
\v 14 And I will make thee like the top of a rock: thou shalt be \add a place\add* to spread nets upon; thou shalt be built no more: for I the \sc Lord\sc* have spoken \add it\add*, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\p
\v 15 Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc* to Tyrus; Shall not the isles shake at the sound of thy fall, when the wounded cry, when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee? 
\v 16 Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and lay away their robes, and put off their broidered garments: they shall clothe themselves with trembling; they shall sit upon the ground, and shall tremble at every moment, and be astonished at thee. 
\v 17 And they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and say to thee, How art thou destroyed, \add that wast\add* inhabited of seafaring men, the renowned city, which wast strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants, which cause their terror \add to be\add* on all that haunt it. 
\v 18 Now shall the isles tremble \add in\add* the day of thy fall; yea, the isles that \add are\add* in the sea shall be troubled at thy departure. 
\v 19 For thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; When I shall make thee a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when \add I\add* shall bring up the deep upon thee, and great waters shall cover thee; 
\v 20 when I shall bring thee down with them that descend into the pit, with the people of old time, and shall set thee in the low parts of the earth, in places desolate of old, with them that go down to the pit, that thou be not inhabited; and I shall set glory in the land of the living; 
\v 21 I will make thee a terror, and thou \add shalt be\add* no \add more:\add* though thou be sought for, yet shalt thou never be found again, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\c 27  
\p
\v 1 The word of the \sc Lord\sc* came again unto me, saying, 
\v 2 Now, thou son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyrus; 
\v 3 and say unto Tyrus, O thou that art situate at the entry of the sea, \add which art\add* a merchant of the people for many isles, Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; O Tyrus, thou hast said, I \add am\add* of perfect beauty. 
\v 4 Thy borders \add are\add* in the midst of the seas, thy builders have perfected thy beauty. 
\v 5 They have made all thy \add ship\add* boards of fir trees of Senir: they have taken cedars from Lebanon to make masts for thee. 
\v 6  \add Of\add* the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; the company of the Ashurites have made thy benches \add of\add* ivory, \add brought\add* out of the isles of Chittim. 
\v 7 Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou spreadest forth to be thy sail; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was that which covered thee. 
\v 8 The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy mariners: thy wise \add men\add*, O Tyrus, \add that\add* were in thee, \add were\add* thy pilots. 
\v 9 The ancients of Gebal and the wise \add men\add* thereof were in thee thy calkers: all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee to occupy thy merchandise. 
\v 10 They of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in thine army, thy men of war: they hanged the shield and helmet in thee; they set forth thy comeliness. 
\v 11 The men of Arvad with thine army \add were\add* upon thy walls round about, and the Gammadims were in thy towers: they hanged their shields upon thy walls round about; they have made thy beauty perfect. 
\v 12 Tarshish \add was\add* thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all \add kind of\add* riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded in thy fairs. 
\v 13 Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they \add were\add* thy merchants: they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass in thy market. 
\v 14 They of the house of Togarmah traded in thy fairs with horses and horsemen and mules. 
\v 15 The men of Dedan \add were\add* thy merchants; many isles \add were\add* the merchandise of thine hand: they brought thee \add for\add* a present horns of ivory and ebeny. 
\v 16 Syria \add was\add* thy merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares of thy making: they occupied in thy fairs with emeralds, purple, and broidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and agate. 
\v 17 Judah, and the land of Israel, they \add were\add* thy merchants: they traded in thy market wheat of Minnith, and Pannag, and honey, and oil, and balm. 
\v 18 Damascus \add was\add* thy merchant in the multitude of the wares of thy making, for the multitude of all riches; in the wine of Helbon, and white wool. 
\v 19 Dan also and Javan going to and fro occupied in thy fairs: bright iron, cassia, and calamus, were in thy market. 
\v 20 Dedan \add was\add* thy merchant in precious clothes for chariots. 
\v 21 Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they occupied with thee in lambs, and rams, and goats: in these \add were they\add* thy merchants. 
\v 22 The merchants of Sheba and Raamah, they \add were\add* thy merchants: they occupied in thy fairs with chief of all spices, and with all precious stones, and gold. 
\v 23 Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, \add and\add* Chilmad, \add were\add* thy merchants. 
\v 24 These \add were\add* thy merchants in all sorts of things, in blue clothes, and broidered work, and in chests of rich apparel, bound with cords, and made of cedar, among thy merchandise. 
\v 25 The ships of Tarshish did sing of thee \add in\add* thy market: and thou wast replenished, and made very glorious in the midst of the seas. 
\v 26 Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters: the east wind hath broken thee in the midst of the seas. 
\v 27 Thy riches, and thy fairs, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy pilots, thy calkers, and the occupiers of thy merchandise, and all thy men of war, that \add are\add* in thee, and in all thy company which \add is\add* in the midst of thee, shall fall into the midst of the seas in the day of thy ruin. 
\v 28 The suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots. 
\v 29 And all that handle the oar, the mariners, \add and\add* all the pilots of the sea, shall come down from their ships, they shall stand upon the land; 
\v 30 and shall cause their voice to be heard against thee, and shall cry bitterly, and shall cast up dust upon their heads, they shall wallow themselves in the ashes: 
\v 31 and they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee, and gird them with sackcloth, and they shall weep for thee with bitterness of heart \add and\add* bitter wailing. 
\v 32 And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and lament over thee, \add saying\add*, What \add city is\add* like Tyrus, like the destroyed in the midst of the sea? 
\v 33 When thy wares went forth out of the seas, thou filledst many people; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise. 
\v 34  \add In\add* the time when \add thou shalt be\add* broken by the seas in the depths of the waters, thy merchandise and all thy company in the midst of thee shall fall. 
\v 35 All the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee, and their kings shall be sore afraid, they shall be troubled \add in their\add* countenance. 
\v 36 The merchants among the people shall hiss at thee; thou shalt be a terror, and never \add shalt be\add* any more. 
\c 28  
\p
\v 1 The word of the \sc Lord\sc* came again unto me, saying, 
\v 2 Son of man, say unto the prince of Tyrus, Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Because thine heart \add is\add* lifted up, and thou hast said, I \add am\add* a God, I sit \add in\add* the seat of God, in the midst of the seas; yet thou \add art\add* a man, and not God, though thou set thine heart as the heart of God: 
\v 3 behold, thou \add art\add* wiser than Daniel; \add there is\add* no secret \add that\add* they can hide \add from\add* thee: 
\v 4 with thy wisdom and with thine understanding thou hast gotten thee riches, and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures: 
\v 5 by thy great wisdom \add and\add* by thy traffick hast thou increased thy riches, and thine heart is lifted up because of thy riches: 
\v 6 therefore thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Because thou hast set thine heart as the heart of God; 
\v 7 behold therefore, I \add will\add* bring strangers upon thee, the terrible of the nations: and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom, and they shall defile thy brightness. 
\v 8 They shall bring thee down to the pit, and thou shalt die the deaths of \add them that are\add* slain in the midst of the seas. 
\v 9 Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee, I \add am\add* God? but thou \add shalt be\add* a man, and no God, in the hand of him that slayeth thee. 
\v 10 Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers: for I have spoken \add it\add*, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\p
\v 11 Moreover the word of the \sc Lord\sc* came unto me, saying, 
\v 12 Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Thou sealest up the sum, full \add of\add* wisdom, and perfect in beauty. 
\v 13 Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone \add was\add* thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created. 
\v 14 Thou \add art\add* the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee \add so:\add* thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. 
\v 15 Thou \add wast\add* perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee. 
\v 16 By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee \add with\add* violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire. 
\v 17 Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that \add they\add* may behold thee. 
\v 18 Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee. 
\v 19 All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never \add shalt\add* thou \add be\add* any more. 
\p
\v 20 Again the word of the \sc Lord\sc* came unto me, saying, 
\v 21 Son of man, set thy face against Zidon, and prophesy against it, 
\v 22 and say, Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Behold, I \add am\add* against thee, O Zidon; and I will be glorified in the midst of thee: and they shall know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*, when I shall have executed judgments in her, and shall be sanctified in her. 
\v 23 For I will send into her pestilence, and blood into her streets; and the wounded shall be judged in the midst of her by the sword upon her on every side; and they shall know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\v 24 And there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of Israel, nor \add any\add* grieving thorn of all \add that are\add* round about them, that despised them; and they shall know that I \add am\add* the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\v 25 Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; When I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the people among whom they are scattered, and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen, then shall they dwell in their land that I have given to my servant Jacob. 
\v 26 And they shall dwell safely therein, and shall build houses, and plant vineyards; yea, they shall dwell with confidence, when I have executed judgments upon all those that despise them round about them; and they shall know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc* their God. 
\c 29  
\p
\v 1 In the tenth year, in the tenth \add month\add*, in the twelfth \add day\add* of the month, the word of the \sc Lord\sc* came unto me, saying, 
\v 2 Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt: 
\v 3 speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Behold, I \add am\add* against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon that lieth in the midst of his rivers, which hath said, My river \add is\add* mine own, and I have made \add it for\add* myself. 
\v 4 But I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales, and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers, and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick unto thy scales. 
\v 5 And I will leave thee \add thrown\add* into the wilderness, thee and all the fish of thy rivers: thou shalt fall upon the open fields; thou shalt not be brought together, nor gathered: I have given thee for meat to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the heaven. 
\v 6 And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel. 
\v 7 When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst break, and rent all their shoulder: and when they leaned upon thee, thou brakest, and madest all their loins to be at a stand. 
\v 8 Therefore thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Behold, I \add will\add* bring a sword upon thee, and cut off man and beast out of thee. 
\v 9 And the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste; and they shall know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*: because he hath said, The river \add is\add* mine, and I have made \add it\add*. 
\v 10 Behold therefore, I \add am\add* against thee, and against thy rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste \add and\add* desolate, from the tower of Syene even unto the border of Ethiopia. 
\v 11 No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years. 
\v 12 And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the countries \add that are\add* desolate, and her cities among the cities \add that are\add* laid waste shall be desolate forty years: and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries. 
\v 13 Yet thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the people whither they were scattered: 
\v 14 and I will bring again the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return \add into\add* the land of Pathros, into the land of their habitation; and they shall be there a base kingdom. 
\v 15 It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations: for I will diminish them, that \add they\add* shall no more rule over the nations. 
\v 16 And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, which bringeth \add their\add* iniquity to remembrance, when they shall look after them: but they shall know that I \add am\add* the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\p
\v 17 And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first \add month\add*, in the first \add day\add* of the month, the word of the \sc Lord\sc* came unto me, saying, 
\v 18 Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyrus: every head \add was\add* made bald, and every shoulder \add was\add* peeled: yet had he no wages, nor his army, for Tyrus, for the service that he had served against it: 
\v 19 therefore thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Behold, I \add will\add* give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall take her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army. 
\v 20 I have given him the land of Egypt \add for\add* his labour wherewith he served against it, because they wrought for me, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\v 21 In that day will I cause the horn of the house of Israel to bud forth, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them; and they shall know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\c 30  
\p
\v 1 The word of the \sc Lord\sc* came again unto me, saying, 
\v 2 Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Howl ye, Woe worth the day! 
\v 3 For the day \add is\add* near, even the day of the \sc Lord\sc* \add is\add* near, a cloudy day; it shall be the time of the heathen. 
\v 4 And the sword shall come upon Egypt, and great pain shall be in Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt, and they shall take \add away\add* her multitude, and her foundations shall be broken down. 
\v 5 Ethiopia, and Libya, and Lydia, and all the mingled people, and Chub, and the men of the land that is in league, shall fall with them by the sword. 
\v 6 Thus saith the \sc Lord\sc*; They also that uphold Egypt shall fall; and the pride of her power shall come down: from the tower of Syene shall they fall in it by the sword, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\v 7 And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries \add that are\add* desolate, and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities \add that are\add* wasted. 
\v 8 And they shall know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*, when I have set a fire in Egypt, and \add when\add* all her helpers shall be destroyed. 
\v 9 In that day shall messengers go forth from me in ships to make the careless Ethiopians afraid, and great pain shall come upon them, as \add in\add* the day of Egypt: for lo, it cometh. 
\v 10 Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon. 
\v 11 He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations, \add shall be\add* brought to destroy the land: and they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land \add with\add* the slain. 
\v 12 And I will make the rivers dry, and sell the land into the hand of the wicked: and I will make the land waste, and all that is therein, by the hand of strangers: I the \sc Lord\sc* have spoken \add it\add*. 
\v 13 Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; I will also destroy the idols, and I will cause \add their\add* images to cease out of Noph; and there shall be no more a prince of the land of Egypt: and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt. 
\v 14 And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set fire in Zoan, and will execute judgments in No. 
\v 15 And I will pour my fury upon Sin, the strength of Egypt; and I will cut off the multitude of No. 
\v 16 And I will set fire in Egypt: Sin shall have great pain, and No shall be rent asunder, and Noph \add shall have\add* distresses daily. 
\v 17 The young men of Aven and of Phi-beseth shall fall by the sword: and these \add cities\add* shall go into captivity. 
\v 18 At Tehaphnehes also the day shall be darkened, when I shall break there the yokes of Egypt: and the pomp of her strength shall cease in her: \add as for\add* her, a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity. 
\v 19 Thus will I execute judgments in Egypt: and they shall know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\p
\v 20 And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first \add month\add*, in the seventh \add day\add* of the month, \add that\add* the word of the \sc Lord\sc* came unto me, saying, 
\v 21 Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and lo, it shall not be bound up to be healed, to put a roller to bind it, to make it strong to hold the sword. 
\v 22 Therefore thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Behold, I \add am\add* against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and will break his arms, the strong, and that which was broken; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand. 
\v 23 And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries. 
\v 24 And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put my sword in his hand: but I will break Pharaoh’s arms, and he shall groan before him \add with\add* the groanings of a deadly wounded \add man\add*. 
\v 25 But I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*, when I shall put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall stretch it out upon the land of Egypt. 
\v 26 And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them among the countries; and they shall know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\c 31  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third \add month\add*, in the first \add day\add* of the month, \add that\add* the word of the \sc Lord\sc* came unto me, saying, 
\v 2 Son of man, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude; Whom art thou like in thy greatness? 
\v 3 Behold, the Assyrian \add was\add* a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a shadowing shrowd, and of a high stature; and his top was among the thick boughs. 
\v 4 The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her rivers running round about his plants, and sent out her little rivers unto all the trees of the field. 
\v 5 Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters, when he shot forth. 
\v 6 All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young, and under his shadow dwelt all great nations. 
\v 7 Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches: for his root was by great waters. 
\v 8 The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir trees were not like his boughs, and the chesnut trees were not like his branches; nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his beauty. 
\v 9 I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so that all the trees of Eden, that \add were\add* in the garden of God, envied him. 
\p
\v 10 Therefore thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Because thou hast lifted up thyself in height, and he hath shot up his top among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height; 
\v 11 I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen; he shall surely deal with him: I have driven him out for his wickedness. 
\v 12 And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land; and all the people of the earth are gone down from his shadow, and have left him. 
\v 13 Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches: 
\v 14 to the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their height, neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs, neither their trees stand up in their height, all that drink water: for they are all delivered unto death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit. 
\p
\v 15 Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; In the day when he went down to the grave I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained the floods thereof, and the great waters were stayed: and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him. 
\v 16 I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, shall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth. 
\v 17 They also went down into hell with him unto \add them that be\add* slain with the sword; and \add they that were\add* his arm, \add that\add* dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the heathen. 
\v 18 To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden unto the nether parts of the earth: thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with \add them that be\add* slain by the sword. This \add is\add* Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\c 32  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first \add day\add* of the month, \add that\add* the word of the \sc Lord\sc* came unto me, saying, 
\v 2 Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say unto him, Thou art like a young lion of the nations, and thou \add art\add* as a whale in the seas: and thou camest forth with thy rivers, and troubledst the waters with thy feet, and fouledst their rivers. 
\v 3 Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; I will therefore spread out my net over thee with a company of many people; and they shall bring thee up in my net. 
\v 4 Then will I leave thee upon the land, I will cast thee forth upon the open field, and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to remain upon thee, and I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee. 
\v 5 And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys \add with\add* thy height. 
\v 6 I will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest, \add even\add* to the mountains; and the rivers shall be full of thee. 
\v 7 And when \add I\add* shall put thee out, I will cover the heaven, and make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give her light. 
\v 8 All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee, and set darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\v 9 I will also vex the hearts of many people, when I shall bring thy destruction among the nations, into the countries which thou hast not known. 
\v 10 Yea, I will make many people amazed at thee, and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee, when I shall brandish my sword before them; and they shall tremble at every moment, every man for his own life, in the day of thy fall. 
\p
\v 11 For thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; The sword of the king of Babylon shall come \add upon\add* thee. 
\v 12 By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall, the terrible of the nations, all of them: and they shall spoil the pomp of Egypt, and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed. 
\v 13 I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from besides the great waters; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more, nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them. 
\v 14 Then will I make their waters deep, and cause their rivers to run like oil, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\v 15 When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate, and the country shall be destitute of that whereof it was full, when I shall smite all them that dwell therein, then shall they know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\v 16 This \add is\add* the lamentation wherewith they shall lament her: the daughters of the nations shall lament her: they shall lament for her, \add even\add* for Egypt, and for all her multitude, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\p
\v 17 It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth \add day\add* of the month, \add that\add* the word of the \sc Lord\sc* came unto me, saying, 
\v 18 Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, \add even\add* her, and the daughters of the famous nations, unto the nether parts of the earth, with them that go down into the pit. 
\v 19 Whom dost thou pass in beauty? go down, and be thou laid with the uncircumcised. 
\v 20 They shall fall in the midst of \add them that are\add* slain by the sword: she is delivered \add to\add* the sword: draw her and all her multitudes. 
\v 21 The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of hell with them that help him: they are gone down, they lie uncircumcised, slain by the sword. 
\v 22 Asshur \add is\add* there and all her company: his graves \add are\add* about him: all of them slain, fallen by the sword: 
\v 23 whose graves are set in the sides of the pit, and her company is round about her grave: all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which caused terror in the land of the living. 
\v 24 There \add is\add* Elam and all her multitude round about her grave, all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which are gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth, which caused their terror in the land of the living; yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit. 
\v 25 They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude: her graves \add are\add* round about him: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword: though their terror was caused in the land of the living, yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit: he is put in the midst of \add them that be\add* slain. 
\v 26 There \add is\add* Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude: her graves \add are\add* round about him: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword, though they caused their terror in the land of the living. 
\v 27 And they shall not lie with the mighty \add that are\add* fallen of the uncircumcised, which are gone down \add to\add* hell with their weapons of war: and they have laid their swords under their heads, but their iniquities shall be upon their bones, though \add they were\add* the terror of the mighty in the land of the living. 
\v 28 Yea, thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and shalt lie with \add them that are\add* slain with the sword. 
\v 29 There \add is\add* Edom, her kings, and all her princes, which with their might are laid by \add them that were\add* slain by the sword: they shall lie with the uncircumcised, and with them that go down to the pit. 
\v 30 There \add be\add* the princes of the north, all of them, and all the Zidonians, which are gone down with the slain; with their terror \add they are\add* ashamed of their might; and they lie uncircumcised with \add them that be\add* slain by the sword, and bear their shame with them that go down to the pit. 
\v 31 Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all his multitude, \add even\add* Pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\v 32 For I have caused my terror in the land of the living: and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with \add them that are\add* slain with the sword, \add even\add* Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\c 33  
\p
\v 1 Again the word of the \sc Lord\sc* came unto me, saying, 
\v 2 Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man of their coasts, and set him for their watchman: 
\v 3  \add if\add* when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people; 
\v 4 then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head. 
\v 5 He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul. 
\v 6 But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword come, and take \add any\add* person from among them, he is taken \add away\add* in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at the watchman’s hand. 
\v 7 So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me. 
\v 8 When I say unto the wicked, O wicked \add man\add*, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked \add man\add* shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand. 
\v 9 Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul. 
\p
\v 10 Therefore, O thou son of man, speak unto the house of Israel; Thus ye speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins \add be\add* upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then live? 
\v 11 Say unto them, \add As\add* I live, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel? 
\v 12 Therefore, thou son of man, say unto the children of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression: as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness; neither shall the righteous be able to live for his \add righteousness\add* in the day that he sinneth. 
\v 13 When I shall say to the righteous, \add that\add* he shall surely live; if he trust to his own righteousness, and commit iniquity, all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered; but for his iniquity that he hath committed, he shall die for it. 
\v 14 Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right; 
\v 15  \add if\add* the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had robbed, walk in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die. 
\v 16 None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live. 
\v 17 Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not equal: but \add as for\add* them, their way is not equal. 
\v 18 When the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, he shall even die thereby. 
\v 19 But if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby. 
\v 20 Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O ye house of Israel, I will judge you every one after his ways. 
\p
\v 21 And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth \add month\add*, in the fifth \add day\add* of the month, \add that\add* one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me, saying, The city is smitten. 
\v 22 Now the hand of the \sc Lord\sc* was upon me in the evening, afore he that was escaped came; and had opened my mouth, until \add he\add* came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb. 
\v 23 Then the word of the \sc Lord\sc* came unto me, saying, 
\v 24 Son of man, they that inhabit those wastes of the land of Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land: but we \add are\add* many; the land is given us for inheritance. 
\v 25 Wherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Ye eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed blood: and shall ye possess the land? 
\v 26 Ye stand upon your sword, ye work abomination, and ye defile every one his neighbour’s wife: and shall ye possess the land? 
\v 27 Say thou thus unto them, Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; \add As\add* I live, surely \add they\add* that \add are\add* in the wastes shall fall by the sword, and him that \add is\add* in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured, and \add they\add* that \add be\add* in the forts and in the caves shall die of the pestilence. 
\v 28 For I will lay the land most desolate, and the pomp of her strength shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, that none shall pass through. 
\v 29 Then shall they know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*, when I have laid the land most desolate because of all their abominations which they have committed. 
\p
\v 30 Also, thou son of man, the children of thy people still are talking against thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what \add is\add* the word that cometh forth from the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\v 31 And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit before thee \add as\add* my people, and they hear thy words, but they will not do them: for with their mouth they shew much love, \add but\add* their heart goeth after their covetousness. 
\v 32 And lo, thou \add art\add* unto them as a very lovely song \add of\add* one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument: for they hear thy words, but they do them not. 
\v 33 And when this cometh to pass, (lo, it will come) then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them. 
\c 34  
\p
\v 1 And the word of the \sc Lord\sc* came unto me, saying, 
\v 2 Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc* unto the shepherds; Woe \add be\add* to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! should not the shepherds feed the flocks? 
\v 3 Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill them that are fed: \add but\add* ye feed not the flock. 
\v 4 The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them. 
\v 5 And they were scattered, because \add there is\add* no shepherd: and they became meat to all the beasts of the field, when they were scattered. 
\v 6 My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high hill: yea, my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth, and none did search or seek \add after them\add*. 
\p
\v 7 Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the \sc Lord\sc*; 
\v 8  \add As\add* I live, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*, surely because my flock became a prey, and my flock became meat to every beast of the field, because \add there was\add* no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search for my flock, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my flock; 
\v 9 therefore, O ye shepherds, hear the word of the \sc Lord\sc*; 
\v 10 thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Behold, I \add am\add* against the shepherds; and I will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; for I will deliver my flock from their mouth, that they may not be meat for them. 
\p
\v 11 For thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Behold, I, \add even\add* I, will both search my sheep, and seek them out. 
\v 12 As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep \add that are\add* scattered; so will I seek out my sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day. 
\v 13 And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them to their own land, and feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers, and in all the inhabited places of the country. 
\v 14 I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie in a good fold, and \add in\add* a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel. 
\v 15 I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\v 16 I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick: but I will destroy the fat and the strong; I will feed them with judgment. 
\v 17 And \add as for\add* you, O my flock, thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Behold, I judge between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he goats. 
\v 18  \add Seemeth it\add* a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures? and to have drunk of the deep waters, but ye must foul the residue with your feet? 
\v 19 And \add as for\add* my flock, they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet; and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet. 
\p
\v 20 Therefore thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc* unto them; Behold, I, \add even\add* I, will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle. 
\v 21 Because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder, and pusht all the diseased with your horns, till ye have scattered them abroad; 
\v 22 therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey; and I will judge between cattle and cattle. 
\v 23 And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, \add even\add* my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd. 
\v 24 And I the \sc Lord\sc* will be their God, and my servant David a prince among them; I the \sc Lord\sc* have spoken \add it\add*. 
\v 25 And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land: and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods. 
\v 26 And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in his season; there shall be showers of blessing. 
\v 27 And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase, and they shall be safe in their land, and shall know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*, when I have broken the bands of their yoke, and delivered them out of the hand of those that served themselves of them. 
\v 28 And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen, neither shall the beast of the land devour them; but they shall dwell safely, and none shall make \add them\add* afraid. 
\v 29 And I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear the shame of the heathen any more. 
\v 30 Thus shall they know that I the \sc Lord\sc* their God \add am\add* with them, and \add that\add* they, \add even\add* the house of Israel, \add are\add* my people, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\v 31 And ye my flock, the flock of my pasture, \add are\add* men, \add and\add* I \add am\add* your God, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\c 35  
\p
\v 1 Moreover the word of the \sc Lord\sc* came unto me, saying, 
\v 2 Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it, 
\v 3 and say unto it, Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Behold, O mount Seir, I \add am\add* against thee, and I will stretch out mine hand against thee, and I will make thee most desolate. 
\v 4 I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou shalt know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\v 5 Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast shed \add the blood of\add* the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time \add that their\add* iniquity \add had\add* an end: 
\v 6 therefore, \add as\add* I live, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*, I will prepare thee unto blood, and blood shall pursue thee: sith thou hast not hated blood, even blood shall pursue thee. 
\v 7 Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it him that passeth out and him that returneth. 
\v 8 And I will fill his mountains \add with\add* his slain \add men:\add* in thy hills, and in thy valleys, and in all thy rivers, shall they fall \add that are\add* slain with the sword. 
\v 9 I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall not return: and ye shall know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\v 10 Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas the \sc Lord\sc* was there: 
\v 11 therefore, \add as\add* I live, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*, I will even do according to thine anger, and according to thine envy which thou hast used out of thy hatred against them; and I will make myself known amongst them, when I have judged thee. 
\v 12 And thou shalt know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*, \add and that\add* I have heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid desolate, they are given us to consume. 
\v 13 Thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me, and have multiplied your words against me: I have heard \add them\add*. 
\v 14 Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will make thee desolate. 
\v 15 As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee: thou shalt be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Idumea, \add even\add* all of it: and they shall know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\c 36  
\p
\v 1 Also, thou son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of Israel, and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the \sc Lord\sc*: 
\v 2 Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Because the enemy hath said against you, Aha, even the ancient high places are ours in possession: 
\v 3 therefore prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Because \add they\add* have made \add you\add* desolate, and swallowed you up on every side, that ye might be a possession unto the residue of the heathen, and ye are taken up in the lips of talkers, and \add are\add* an infamy of the people: 
\v 4 therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord \sc God\sc*; Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc* to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes, and to the cities that are forsaken, which became a prey and derision to the residue of the heathen that \add are\add* round about; 
\v 5 therefore thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Surely in the fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the heathen, and against all Idumea, which have appointed my land into their possession with the joy of all \add their\add* heart, with despiteful minds, to cast it out for a prey. 
\v 6 Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel, and say unto the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my fury, because ye have borne the shame of the heathen: 
\v 7 therefore thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; I have lifted up mine hand, Surely the heathen that \add are\add* about you, they shall bear their shame. 
\p
\v 8 But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit to my people of Israel; for they are at hand to come. 
\v 9 For behold, I \add am\add* for you, and I will turn unto you, and ye shall be tilled and sown: 
\v 10 and I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, \add even\add* all of it: and the cities shall be inhabited, and the wastes shall be builded: 
\v 11 and I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall increase and bring fruit: and I will settle you after your old estates, and will do better \add unto you\add* than at your beginnings: and ye shall know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\v 12 Yea, I will cause men to walk upon you, \add even\add* my people Israel; and they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be their inheritance, and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of men. 
\v 13 Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Because they say unto you, Thou \add land\add* devourest up men, and hast bereaved thy nations; 
\v 14 therefore thou shalt devour men no more, neither bereave thy nations any more, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\v 15 Neither will I cause \add men\add* to hear in thee the shame of the heathen any more, neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the people any more, neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fall any more, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\p
\v 16 Moreover the word of the \sc Lord\sc* came unto me, saying, 
\v 17 Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their own way and by their doings: their way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman. 
\v 18 Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land, and for their idols \add wherewith\add* they had polluted it: 
\v 19 and I scattered them among the heathen, and they were dispersed through the countries: according to their way and according to their doings I judged them. 
\v 20 And when they entered unto the heathen, whither they went, they profaned my holy name, when \add they\add* said to them, These \add are\add* the people of the \sc Lord\sc*, and are gone forth out of his land. 
\v 21 But I had pity for mine holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the heathen, whither they went. 
\v 22 Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; I do not \add this\add* for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for mine holy name’s sake, which ye have profaned among the heathen, whither ye went. 
\v 23 And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the heathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the heathen shall know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes. 
\v 24 For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your own land. 
\p
\v 25 Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you. 
\v 26 A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh. 
\v 27 And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do \add them\add*. 
\v 28 And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God. 
\v 29 I will also save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will call for the corn, and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you. 
\v 30 And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen. 
\v 31 Then shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that \add were\add* not good, and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations. 
\v 32 Not for your sakes do I \add this\add*, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*, be it known unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house of Israel. 
\v 33 Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; In the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities, I will also cause \add you\add* to dwell in the cities, and the wastes shall be builded. 
\v 34 And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by. 
\v 35 And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities \add are become\add* fenced, \add and\add* are inhabited. 
\v 36 Then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that I the \sc Lord\sc* build the ruined \add places, and\add* plant that that was desolate: I the \sc Lord\sc* have spoken \add it\add*, and I will do \add it\add*. 
\v 37 Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; I will yet \add for\add* this be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do \add it\add* for them; I will increase them \add with\add* men like a flock. 
\v 38 As the holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts; so shall the waste cities be filled \add with\add* flocks of men: and they shall know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\c 37  
\p
\v 1 The hand of the \sc Lord\sc* was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit of the \sc Lord\sc*, and set me down in the midst of the valley which \add was\add* full \add of\add* bones, 
\v 2 and caused me to pass by them round about: and behold, \add there were\add* very many in the open valley; and lo, \add they were\add* very dry. 
\v 3 And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord \sc God\sc*, thou knowest. 
\v 4 Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\v 5 Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc* unto these bones; Behold, I \add will\add* cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live: 
\v 6 and I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\v 7 So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone. 
\v 8 And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above: but \add there was\add* no breath in them. 
\v 9 Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live. 
\v 10 So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army. 
\v 11 Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones \add are\add* the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off for our parts. 
\v 12 Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Behold, O my people, I \add will\add* open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel. 
\v 13 And ye shall know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*, when I have opened your graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves, 
\v 14 and shall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place you in your own land: then shall ye know that I the \sc Lord\sc* have spoken \add it\add*, and performed \add it\add*, saith the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\p
\v 15 The word of the \sc Lord\sc* came again unto me, saying, 
\v 16 Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and \add for\add* all the house of Israel his companions: 
\v 17 and join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in thine hand. 
\v 18 And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by these? 
\v 19 say unto them, Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Behold, I \add will\add* take the stick of Joseph, which \add is\add* in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him, \add even\add* with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in mine hand. 
\v 20 And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before their eyes. 
\v 21 And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Behold, I \add will\add* take the children of Israel from among the heathen, whither they be gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land: 
\v 22 and I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all: 
\v 23 neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions: but I will save them out of all their dwelling places, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God. 
\v 24 And David my servant \add shall be\add* king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them. 
\v 25 And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant, wherein your fathers have dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, \add even\add* they, and their children, and their children’s children for ever: and my servant David \add shall be\add* their prince for ever. 
\v 26 Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore. 
\v 27 My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their God, and they shall be my people. 
\v 28 And the heathen shall know that I the \sc Lord\sc* do sanctify Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore. 
\c 38  
\p
\v 1 And the word of the \sc Lord\sc* came unto me, saying, 
\v 2 Son of man, set thy face against Gog, the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him, 
\v 3 and say, Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Behold, I \add am\add* against thee, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal: 
\v 4 and I will turn thee back, and put hooks into thy jaws, and I will bring thee forth, and all thine army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed with all sorts \add of armour, even\add* a great company \add with\add* bucklers and shields, all of them handling swords: 
\v 5 Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya with them; all of them \add with\add* shield and helmet: 
\v 6 Gomer, and all his bands; the house of Togarmah \add of\add* the north quarters, and all his bands: \add and\add* many people with thee. 
\v 7 Be thou prepared, and prepare for thyself, thou, and all thy company that are assembled unto thee, and be thou a guard unto them. 
\v 8 After many days thou shalt be visited: in the latter years thou shalt come into the land \add that is\add* brought back from the sword, \add and is\add* gathered out of many people, against the mountains of Israel, which have been always waste: but it is brought forth out of the nations, and they shall dwell safely all of them. 
\v 9 Thou shalt ascend and come like a storm, thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land, thou, and all thy bands, and many people with thee. 
\p
\v 10 Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; It shall also come to pass, \add that\add* at the same time shall things come into thy mind, and thou shalt think an evil thought: 
\v 11 and thou shalt say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages; I will go \add to\add* them that are at rest, that dwell safely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates, 
\v 12 to take a spoil, and to take a prey; to turn thine hand upon the desolate places \add that are now\add* inhabited, and upon the people \add that are\add* gathered out of the nations, which have gotten cattle and goods, that dwell in the midst of the land. 
\v 13 Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the young lions thereof, shall say unto thee, Art thou come to take a spoil? hast thou gathered thy company to take a prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take \add away\add* cattle and goods, to take a great spoil? 
\v 14 Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say unto Gog, Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; In that day when my people of Israel dwelleth safely, shalt thou not know \add it?\add* 
\v 15 And thou shalt come from thy place out of the north parts, thou, and many people with thee, all of them riding upon horses, a great company, and a mighty army: 
\v 16 and thou shalt come up against my people of Israel, as a cloud to cover the land; it shall be in the latter days, and I will bring thee against my land, that the heathen may know me, when I shall be sanctified in thee, O Gog, before their eyes. 
\p
\v 17 Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; \add Art\add* thou he of whom I have spoken in old time by my servants the prophets of Israel, which prophesied in those days \add many\add* years, that \add I\add* would bring thee against them? 
\v 18 And it shall come to pass at the same time when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*, \add that\add* my fury shall come up in my face. 
\v 19 For in my jealousy \add and\add* in the fire of my wrath have I spoken, Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel; 
\v 20 so that the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth, and all the men that \add are\add* upon the face of the earth, shall shake at my presence, and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground. 
\v 21 And I will call \add for\add* a sword against him throughout all my mountains, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*: every man’s sword shall be against his brother. 
\v 22 And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood; and I will rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon the many people that \add are\add* with him, an overflowing rain, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone. 
\v 23 Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I will be known in the eyes of many nations, and they shall know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\c 39  
\p
\v 1 Therefore thou son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Behold, I \add am\add* against thee, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal: 
\v 2 and I will turn thee back, and leave but the sixth part of thee, and will cause thee to come up from the north parts, and will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel: 
\v 3 and I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand, and will cause thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand. 
\v 4 Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou, and all thy bands, and the people that \add is\add* with thee: I will give thee unto the ravenous birds of every sort, and \add to\add* the beasts of the field to be devoured. 
\v 5 Thou shalt fall upon the open field: for I have spoken \add it\add*, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\v 6 And I will send a fire on Magog, and among them that dwell carelessly in the isles: and they shall know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\v 7 So will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel; and I will not let \add them\add* pollute my holy name any more: and the heathen shall know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc*, the Holy One in Israel. 
\p
\v 8 Behold, it is come, and it is done, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; this \add is\add* the day whereof I have spoken. 
\v 9 And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the handstaves, and the spears, and they shall burn them with fire seven years: 
\v 10 so that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut down \add any\add* out of the forests; for they shall burn the weapons with fire: and they shall spoil those that spoiled them, and rob those that robbed them, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\v 11 And it shall come to pass in that day, \add that\add* I will give unto Gog a place there of graves in Israel, the valley of the passengers \add on\add* the east of the sea: and it \add shall\add* stop the \add noses of the\add* passengers: and there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude: and they shall call \add it\add* The valley of Hamon-gog. 
\v 12 And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying of them, that \add they\add* may cleanse the land. 
\v 13 Yea, all the people of the land shall bury \add them;\add* and it shall be to them a renown the day that I shall be glorified, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\v 14 And they shall sever out men of continual employment, passing through the land to bury with the passengers those that remain upon the face of the earth, to cleanse it: after the end of seven months shall they search. 
\v 15 And the passengers \add that\add* pass through the land, when \add any\add* seeth a man’s bone, then shall he set up a sign by it, till the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamon-gog. 
\v 16 And also the name of the city \add shall be\add* Hamonah. Thus shall they cleanse the land. 
\p
\v 17 And thou son of man, thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Speak unto every feathered fowl, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, \add even\add* a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh, and drink blood. 
\v 18 Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bullocks, all of them fatlings of Bashan. 
\v 19 And ye shall eat fat till \add ye\add* be full, and drink blood till \add ye\add* be drunken, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you. 
\v 20 Thus ye shall be filled at my table \add with\add* horses and chariots, with mighty \add men\add*, and \add with\add* all men of war, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\v 21 And I will set my glory among the heathen, and all the heathen shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid upon them. 
\v 22 So the house of Israel shall know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc* their God from that day and forward. 
\v 23 And the heathen shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity: because they trespassed against me, therefore hid I my face from them, and gave them into the hand of their enemies: so fell they all by the sword. 
\v 24 According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions have I done unto them, and hid my face from them. 
\p
\v 25 Therefore thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Now will I bring again the captivity of Jacob, and have mercy upon the whole house of Israel, and will be jealous for my holy name; 
\v 26 after that they have borne their shame, and all their trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me, when they dwelt safely in their land, and none made \add them\add* afraid. 
\v 27 When I have brought them again from the people, and gathered them out of their enemies’ lands, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations; 
\v 28 then shall they know that I \add am\add* the \sc Lord\sc* their God, which caused them to be led into captivity among the heathen: but I have gathered them unto their own land, and have left none of them any more there. 
\v 29 Neither will I hide my face any more from them: for I have poured out my spirit upon the house of Israel, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\c 40  
\p
\v 1 In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth \add day\add* of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day the hand of the \sc Lord\sc* was upon me, and brought me thither. 
\v 2 In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a very high mountain, by which \add was\add* as the frame of a city on the south. 
\v 3 And he brought me thither, and behold, \add there was\add* a man, whose appearance \add was\add* like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate. 
\v 4 And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all that I shall shew thee; for to the intent that \add I\add* might shew \add them\add* unto thee art thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel. 
\v 5 And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man’s hand a measuring reed of six cubits \add long\add* by the cubit and a hand breadth: so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed. 
\p
\v 6 Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up the stairs thereof, and measured the threshold of the gate, \add which was\add* one reed broad; and the other threshold \add of the gate, which was\add* one reed broad. 
\v 7 And \add every\add* little chamber \add was\add* one reed long, and one reed broad; and between the little chambers \add were\add* five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within \add was\add* one reed. 
\v 8 He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed. 
\v 9 Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate \add was\add* inward. 
\v 10 And the little chambers of the gate eastward \add were\add* three on this side, and three on that side; they three \add were\add* of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side. 
\v 11 And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits; \add and\add* the length of the gate, thirteen cubits. 
\v 12 The space also before the little chambers \add was\add* one cubit \add on this side\add*, and the space \add was\add* one cubit on that side: and the little chambers \add were\add* six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side. 
\v 13 He measured then the gate from the roof of \add one\add* little chamber to the roof of another: the breadth \add was\add* five and twenty cubits, door against door. 
\v 14 He made also posts \add of\add* threescore cubits, even unto the post of the court round about the gate. 
\v 15 And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of the porch of the inner gate \add were\add* fifty cubits. 
\v 16 And \add there were\add* narrow windows to the little chambers, and to their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches: and windows \add were\add* round about inward: and upon \add each\add* post \add were\add* palm trees. 
\p
\v 17 Then brought he me into the outward court, and lo, \add there were\add* chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about: thirty chambers \add were\add* upon the pavement. 
\v 18 And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the length of the gates \add was\add* the lower pavement. 
\v 19 Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, an hundred cubits east\add ward\add* and north\add ward\add*. 
\p
\v 20 And the gate of the outward court that looked toward the north, he measured the length thereof, and the breadth thereof. 
\v 21 And the little chambers thereof \add were\add* three on this side and three on that side; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate: the length thereof \add was\add* fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits. 
\v 22 And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees, \add were\add* after the measure of the gate that looketh towards the east; and they went up unto it by seven steps; and the arches thereof \add were\add* before them. 
\v 23 And the gate of the inner court \add was\add* over against the gate toward the north, and toward the east; and he measured from gate to gate an hundred cubits. 
\p
\v 24 After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate toward the south: and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures. 
\v 25 And \add there were\add* windows in it and in the arches thereof round about, like those windows: the length \add was\add* fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits. 
\v 26 And \add there were\add* seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof \add were\add* before them: and it had palm trees, one on this side, and another on that side, upon the posts thereof. 
\v 27 And \add there was\add* a gate in the inner court toward the south: and he measured from gate to gate toward the south an hundred cubits. 
\p
\v 28 And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he measured the south gate according to these measures; 
\v 29 and the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures: and \add there were\add* windows in it and in the arches thereof round about: \add it was\add* fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad. 
\v 30 And the arches round about \add were\add* five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad. 
\v 31 And the arches thereof \add were\add* toward the utter court; and palm trees \add were\add* upon the posts thereof: and the going up to it \add had\add* eight steps. 
\p
\v 32 And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he measured the gate according to these measures. 
\v 33 And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, \add were\add* according to these measures: and \add there were\add* windows therein and in the arches thereof round about: \add it was\add* fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad. 
\v 34 And the arches thereof \add were\add* toward the outward court; and palm trees \add were\add* upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up to it \add had\add* eight steps. 
\p
\v 35 And he brought me to the north gate, and measured \add it\add* according to these measures; 
\v 36 the little chambers thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, and the windows to it round about: the length \add was\add* fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits. 
\v 37 And the posts thereof \add were\add* toward the utter court; and palm trees \add were\add* upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up to it \add had\add* eight steps. 
\v 38 And the chambers and the entries thereof \add were\add* by the posts of the gates, where they washed the burnt offering. 
\p
\v 39 And in the porch of the gate \add were\add* two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering. 
\v 40 And at the side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the north gate, \add were\add* two tables; and on the other side, which \add was\add* at the porch of the gate, \add were\add* two tables. 
\v 41 Four tables \add were\add* on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew \add their sacrifices\add*. 
\v 42 And the four tables \add were\add* of hewn stone for the burnt offering, of a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high: whereupon also they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt offering and the sacrifice. 
\v 43 And within \add were\add* hooks, a hand broad, fastened round about: and upon the tables \add was\add* the flesh of the offering. 
\p
\v 44 And without the inner gate \add were\add* the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which \add was\add* at the side of the north gate; and their prospect \add was\add* toward the south: one at the side of the east gate \add having\add* the prospect toward the north. 
\v 45 And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect \add is\add* toward the south, \add is\add* for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house. 
\v 46 And the chamber whose prospect \add is\add* toward the north \add is\add* for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these \add are\add* the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, which come near to the \sc Lord\sc* to minister unto him. 
\v 47 So he measured the court, an hundred cubits long, and an hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar \add that was\add* before the house. 
\p
\v 48 And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured \add each\add* post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate \add was\add* three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side. 
\v 49 The length of the porch \add was\add* twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits; and \add he brought me\add* by the steps whereby they went up to it: and \add there were\add* pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side. 
\c 41  
\p
\v 1 Afterward he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, \add which was\add* the breadth of the tabernacle. 
\v 2 And the breadth of the door \add was\add* ten cubits; and the sides of the door \add were\add* five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured the length thereof, forty cubits: and the breadth, twenty cubits. 
\v 3 Then went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven cubits. 
\v 4 So he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This \add is\add* the most holy \add place\add*. 
\v 5 After he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of \add every\add* side chamber, four cubits, round about the house on every side. 
\v 6 And the side chambers \add were\add* three, one over another, and thirty \add in\add* order; and they entered into the wall which \add was\add* of the house for the side chambers round about, that \add they\add* might have hold, but they had not hold in the wall of the house. 
\v 7 And \add there was\add* an enlarging, and a winding about still upward to the side chambers: for the winding about of the house \add went\add* still upward round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house \add was still\add* upward, and so increased \add from\add* the lowest \add chamber\add* to the highest by the midst. 
\v 8 I saw also the height of the house round about: the foundations of the side chambers \add were\add* a full reed of six great cubits. 
\v 9 The thickness of the wall, which \add was\add* for the side chamber without, \add was\add* five cubits: and \add that\add* which \add was\add* left \add was\add* the place of the side chambers that \add were\add* within. 
\v 10 And between the chambers \add was\add* the wideness of twenty cubits round about the house on every side. 
\v 11 And the doors of the side chambers \add were\add* toward \add the place\add* that \add was\add* left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and the breadth of the place that was left \add was\add* five cubits round about. 
\p
\v 12 Now the building that \add was\add* before the separate place \add at\add* the end toward the west \add was\add* seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building \add was\add* five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof ninety cubits. 
\v 13 So he measured the house, an hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, an hundred cubits long; 
\v 14 also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, an hundred cubits. 
\v 15 And he measured the length of the building over against the separate place which \add was\add* behind it, and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side, an hundred cubits, with the inner temple, and the porches of the court; 
\v 16 the door posts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries round about on their three \add stories\add*, over against the door, cieled with wood round about, and \add from\add* the ground up to the windows, and the windows \add were\add* covered; 
\v 17 to \add that\add* above the door, even unto the inner house, and without, and by all the wall round about within and without, \add by\add* measure. 
\v 18 And \add it was\add* made \add with\add* cherubims and palm trees, so that a palm tree \add was\add* between a cherub and a cherub; and \add every\add* cherub had two faces; 
\v 19 so that the face of a man \add was\add* toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side: \add it was\add* made through all the house round about. 
\v 20 From the ground unto above the door \add were\add* cherubims and palm trees made, and \add on\add* the wall of the temple. 
\p
\v 21 The posts of the temple \add were\add* squared, \add and\add* the face of the sanctuary; the appearance \add of the one\add* as the appearance \add of the other\add*. 
\v 22 The altar \add of\add* wood \add was\add* three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls thereof, \add were of\add* wood: and he said unto me, This \add is\add* the table that \add is\add* before the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\v 23 And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors. 
\v 24 And the doors had two leaves \add apiece\add*, two turning leaves; two \add leaves\add* for the one door, and two leaves for the other \add door\add*. 
\v 25 And \add there were\add* made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubims and palm trees, like as \add were\add* made upon the walls; and \add there were\add* thick planks upon the face of the porch without. 
\v 26 And \add there were\add* narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch, and \add upon\add* the side chambers of the house, and thick planks. 
\c 42  
\p
\v 1 Then he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that \add was\add* over against the separate place, and which \add was\add* before the building toward the north. 
\v 2 Before the length of an hundred cubits \add was\add* the north door, and the breadth \add was\add* fifty cubits. 
\v 3 Over against the twenty \add cubits\add* which \add were\add* for the inner court, and over against the pavement which \add was\add* for the utter court, \add was\add* gallery against gallery in three \add stories\add*. 
\v 4 And before the chambers \add was\add* a walk of ten cubits breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors toward the north. 
\v 5 Now the upper chambers \add were\add* shorter: for the galleries were higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the building. 
\v 6 For they \add were\add* in three \add stories\add*, but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore \add the building\add* was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground. 
\v 7 And the wall that \add was\add* without over against the chambers, towards the utter court on the forepart of the chambers, the length thereof \add was\add* fifty cubits. 
\v 8 For the length of the chambers that \add were\add* in the utter court \add was\add* fifty cubits: and lo, before the temple \add were\add* an hundred cubits. 
\v 9 And from under these chambers \add was\add* the entry on the east side, as one goeth into them from the utter court. 
\v 10 The chambers \add were\add* in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, over against the separate place, and over against the building. 
\v 11 And the way before them \add was\add* like the appearance of the chambers which \add were\add* toward the north, as long as they, \add and\add* as broad as they: and all their goings out \add were\add* both according to their fashions, and according to their doors. 
\v 12 And according to the doors of the chambers that \add were\add* toward the south \add was\add* a door in the head of the way, \add even\add* the way directly before the wall toward the east, as \add one\add* entereth into them. 
\p
\v 13 Then said he unto me, The north chambers \add and\add* the south chambers, which \add are\add* before the separate place, they \add be\add* holy chambers, where the priests that approach unto the \sc Lord\sc* shall eat the most holy \add things:\add* there shall they lay the most holy \add things\add*, and the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place \add is\add* holy. 
\v 14 When the priests enter \add therein\add*, then shall they not go out of the holy \add place\add* into the utter court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they \add are\add* holy; and shall put on other garments, and shall approach to \add those things\add* which \add are\add* for the people. 
\p
\v 15 Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect \add is\add* toward the east, and measured it round about. 
\v 16 He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about. 
\v 17 He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about. 
\v 18 He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed. 
\v 19 He turned about to the west side, \add and\add* measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed. 
\v 20 He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about, five hundred \add reeds\add* long, and five hundred broad, to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane \add place\add*. 
\c 43  
\p
\v 1 Afterward he brought me to the gate, \add even\add* the gate that looketh toward the east: 
\v 2 and behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice \add was\add* like a noise of many waters: and the earth shined with his glory. 
\v 3 And \add it was\add* according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, \add even\add* according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city: and the visions \add were\add* like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face. 
\v 4 And the glory of the \sc Lord\sc* came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect \add is\add* toward the east. 
\v 5 So the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and behold, the glory of the \sc Lord\sc* filled the house. 
\v 6 And I heard \add him\add* speaking unto me out of the house; and \add the\add* man stood by me. 
\v 7 And he said unto me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall the house of Israel no more defile, \add neither\add* they, nor their kings, by their whoredom, nor by the carcases of their kings \add in\add* their high places. 
\v 8 In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds, and their post by my posts, and the wall between me and them, they have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed: wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger. 
\v 9 Now let them put away their whoredom, and the carcases of their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever. 
\p
\v 10 Thou son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure the pattern. 
\v 11 And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, shew them the form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the laws thereof: and write \add it\add* in their sight, that they may keep the whole form thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and do them. 
\v 12 This \add is\add* the law of the house; Upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about \add shall be\add* most holy. Behold, this \add is\add* the law of the house. 
\p
\v 13 And these \add are\add* the measures of the altar after the cubits: The cubit \add is\add* a cubit and a hand breadth; even the bottom \add shall be\add* a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border thereof by the edge thereof round about \add shall be\add* a span: and this \add shall be\add* the higher place of the altar. 
\v 14 And from the bottom \add upon\add* the ground \add even\add* to the lower settle \add shall be\add* two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser settle \add even\add* to the greater settle \add shall be\add* four cubits, and the breadth \add one\add* cubit. 
\v 15 So the altar \add shall be\add* four cubits; and from the altar and upward \add shall be\add* four horns. 
\v 16 And the altar \add shall be\add* twelve \add cubits\add* long, twelve broad, square in the four squares thereof. 
\v 17 And the settle \add shall be\add* fourteen \add cubits\add* long and fourteen broad in the four squares thereof; and the border about it \add shall be\add* half a cubit; and the bottom thereof \add shall be\add* a cubit about; and his stairs \add shall\add* look toward the east. 
\p
\v 18 And he said unto me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; These \add are\add* the ordinances of the altar in the day when \add they\add* shall make it, to offer burnt offerings thereon, and to sprinkle blood thereon. 
\v 19 And thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that \add be\add* of the seed of Zadok, which approach unto me, to minister unto me, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*, a young bullock for a sin offering. 
\v 20 And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put \add it\add* on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the settle, and upon the border round about: thus shalt thou cleanse and purge it. 
\v 21 Thou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering, and he shall burn it in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary. 
\v 22 And on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they did cleanse \add it\add* with the bullock. 
\v 23 When thou hast made an end of cleansing \add it\add*, thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish. 
\v 24 And thou shalt offer them before the \sc Lord\sc*, and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up \add for\add* a burnt offering unto the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\v 25 Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat \add for\add* a sin offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish. 
\v 26 Seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it; and they shall consecrate themselves. 
\v 27 And when \add these\add* days are expired, it shall be, \add that\add* upon the eight day, and \add so\add* forward, the priests shall make your burnt offerings upon the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will accept you, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\c 44  
\p
\v 1 Then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward sanctuary which looketh \add toward\add* the east; and it \add was\add* shut. 
\v 2 Then said the \sc Lord\sc* unto me; This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the \sc Lord\sc*, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut. 
\v 3  \add It is\add* for the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat bread before the \sc Lord\sc*; he shall enter by the way of the porch of \add that\add* gate, and shall go out by the way of the same. 
\p
\v 4 Then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house: and I looked, and behold, the glory of the \sc Lord\sc* filled the house of the \sc Lord\sc*: and I fell upon my face. 
\v 5 And the \sc Lord\sc* said unto me, Son of man, mark well, and behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say unto thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of the \sc Lord\sc*, and all the laws thereof; and mark well the entering in of the house, with every going forth of the sanctuary. 
\v 6 And thou shalt say to the rebellious, \add even\add* to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; O ye house of Israel, let it suffice you of all your abominations, 
\v 7 in that ye have brought \add into my sanctuary\add* strangers, uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to pollute it, \add even\add* my house, when ye offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant because of all your abominations. 
\v 8 And ye have not kept the charge of mine holy \add things:\add* but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves. 
\p
\v 9 Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; No stranger, uncircumcised in heart, nor uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any stranger that \add is\add* among the children of Israel. 
\v 10 And the Levites that are gone away far from me, when Israel went astray, which went astray away from me after their idols; they shall even bear their iniquity. 
\v 11 Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, \add having\add* charge at the gates of the house, and ministering to the house: they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister unto them. 
\v 12 Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity; therefore have I lift up mine hand against them, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*, and they shall bear their iniquity. 
\v 13 And they shall not come near unto me, to do the office of a priest unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy \add things\add*, in the most holy \add place:\add* but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed. 
\v 14 But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein. 
\v 15 But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister unto me, and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*: 
\v 16 they shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge. 
\p
\v 17 And it shall come to pass, \add that\add* when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no wool shall come upon them, whiles they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within. 
\v 18 They shall have linen bonnets upon their heads, and shall have linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird \add themselves\add* with any thing that causeth sweat. 
\v 19 And when they go forth into the utter court, \add even\add* into the utter court to the people, they shall put off their garments wherein they ministered, and lay them in the holy chambers, and they shall put on other garments; and they shall not sanctify the people with their garments. 
\v 20 Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer \add their\add* locks to grow long; they shall only poll their heads. 
\v 21 Neither shall any priest drink wine, when they enter into the inner court. 
\v 22 Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that is put away: but they shall take maidens of the seed of the house of Israel, or a widow that had a priest before. 
\v 23 And they shall teach my people \add the difference\add* between the holy and profane, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean. 
\v 24 And in controversy they shall stand in judgment; \add and\add* they shall judge it according to my judgments: and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all mine assemblies; and they shall hallow my sabbaths. 
\v 25 And they shall come at no dead person to defile \add themselves:\add* but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister that hath had no husband, they may defile themselves. 
\v 26 And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon unto him seven days. 
\v 27 And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, unto the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\v 28 And it shall be unto them for an inheritance: I \add am\add* their inheritance: and ye shall give them no possession in Israel: I \add am\add* their possession. 
\v 29 They shall eat the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; and every dedicate thing in Israel shall be theirs. 
\v 30 And the first of all the firstfruits of all \add things\add*, and every oblation of all, of every \add sort\add* of your oblations, shall be the priests’: ye shall also give unto the priest the first of your dough, that he may cause the blessing to rest in thine house. 
\v 31 The priests shall not eat \add of\add* any thing that is dead of itself, or torn, whether it be fowl or beast. 
\c 45  
\p
\v 1 Moreover, when ye shall divide \add by lot\add* the land for inheritance, ye shall offer an oblation unto the \sc Lord\sc*, a holy \add portion\add* of the land: the length \add shall be\add* the length \add of\add* five and twenty thousand \add reeds\add*, and the breadth \add shall be\add* ten thousand. This \add shall be\add* holy in all the borders thereof round about. 
\v 2 Of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred \add in length\add*, with five hundred \add in breadth\add*, square round about; and fifty cubits round about \add for\add* the suburbs thereof. 
\v 3 And of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and twenty thousand, and the breadth of ten thousand: and in it shall be the sanctuary \add and\add* the most holy \add place\add*. 
\v 4 The holy \add portion\add* of the land shall be for the priests the ministers of the sanctuary, which shall come near to minister unto the \sc Lord\sc*: and it shall be a place for their houses, and a holy place for the sanctuary. 
\v 5 And \add the\add* five and twenty thousand of length, and \add the\add* ten thousand of breadth, shall also the Levites, the ministers of the house, have for themselves, for a possession \add for\add* twenty chambers. 
\v 6 And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad, and five and twenty thousand long, over against the oblation of the holy \add portion:\add* it shall be for the whole house of Israel. 
\v 7 And \add a portion shall be\add* for the prince on the one side and on the other side of the oblation of the holy \add portion\add*, and of the possession of the city, before the oblation of the holy \add portion\add*, and before the possession of the city, from the west side westward, and from the east side eastward: and the length \add shall be\add* over against one of the portions, from the west border unto the east border. 
\v 8 In the land shall be his possession in Israel: and my princes shall no more oppress my people; and \add the rest of\add* the land shall they give to the house of Israel according to their tribes. 
\p
\v 9 Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; Let it suffice you, O princes of Israel: remove violence and spoil, and execute judgment and justice, take away your exactions from my people, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\v 10 Ye shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath. 
\v 11 The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath may contain the tenth part of a homer, and the ephah the tenth \add part\add* of a homer: the measure thereof shall be after the homer. 
\v 12 And the shekel \add shall be\add* twenty gerahs: twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh. 
\v 13 This \add is\add* the oblation that ye shall offer; the sixth \add part\add* of an ephah of a homer of wheat, and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah of a homer of barley: 
\v 14 concerning the ordinance of oil, the bath \add of\add* oil, \add ye shall offer\add* the tenth part of a bath out of the cor, \add which is\add* a homer of ten baths; for ten baths \add are\add* a homer: 
\v 15 and one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, out of the fat pastures of Israel; for a meat offering, and for a burnt offering, and for peace offerings, to make reconciliation for them, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\v 16 All the people of the land shall give this oblation for the prince in Israel. 
\v 17 And it shall be the prince’s part \add to give\add* burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and drink offerings, in the feasts, and in the new moons, and in the sabbaths, in all solemnities of the house of Israel: he shall prepare the sin offering, and the meat offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings, to make reconciliation for the house of Israel. 
\p
\v 18 Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; In the first \add month\add*, in the first \add day\add* of the month, thou shalt take a young bullock without blemish, and cleanse the sanctuary: 
\v 19 and the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering, and put \add it\add* upon the posts of the house, and upon the four corners of the settle of the altar, and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court. 
\v 20 And so thou shalt do the seventh \add day\add* of the month for every one that erreth, and for \add him that is\add* simple: so shall ye reconcile the house. 
\v 21 In the first \add month\add*, in the fourteenth day of the month, ye shall have the passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten. 
\v 22 And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock \add for\add* a sin offering. 
\v 23 And seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the \sc Lord\sc*, seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days; and a kid of the goats daily \add for\add* a sin offering. 
\v 24 And he shall prepare a meat offering \add of\add* an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and a hin of oil for an ephah. 
\v 25 In the seventh \add month\add*, in the fifteenth day of the month, shall he do the like in the feast \add of\add* the seven days, according to the sin offering, according to the burnt offering, and according to the meat offering, and according to the oil. 
\c 46  
\p
\v 1 Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; The gate of the inner court that looketh \add toward\add* the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the sabbath it shall be opened, and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened. 
\v 2 And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of \add that\add* gate without, and shall stand by the post of the gate, and the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate: then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening. 
\v 3 Likewise the people of the land shall worship \add at\add* the door of this gate before the \sc Lord\sc* in the sabbaths and in the new moons. 
\v 4 And the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the \sc Lord\sc* in the sabbath day \add shall be\add* six lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish. 
\v 5 And the meat offering \add shall be\add* an ephah for a ram, and the meat offering for the lambs as he shall be able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah. 
\v 6 And in the day of the new moon \add it shall be\add* a young bullock without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram: they shall be without blemish. 
\v 7 And he shall prepare a meat offering, an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs according as his hand shall attain unto, and a hin of oil to an ephah. 
\v 8 And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in \add by\add* the way of the porch of \add that\add* gate, and he shall go forth by the way thereof. 
\p
\v 9 But when the people of the land shall come before the \sc Lord\sc* in the solemn feasts, he that entereth in \add by\add* the way of the north gate to worship shall go out \add by\add* the way of the south gate; and he that entereth \add by\add* the way of the south gate shall go forth \add by\add* the way of the north gate: he shall not return \add by\add* the way of the gate whereby he came in, but shall go forth over against it. 
\v 10 And the prince in the midst of them, when they go in, shall go in; and when they go forth, shall go forth. 
\v 11 And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat offering shall be an ephah to a bullock, and an ephah to a ram, and to the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah. 
\v 12 Now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or peace offerings voluntarily unto the \sc Lord\sc*, \add one\add* shall then open him the gate that looketh \add toward\add* the east, and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, as he did on the sabbath day: then he shall go forth; and after his going forth \add one\add* shall shut the gate. 
\v 13 Thou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering unto the \sc Lord\sc* \add of\add* a lamb of the first year without blemish: thou shalt prepare it every morning. 
\v 14 And thou shalt prepare a meat offering for it every morning, the sixth \add part\add* of an ephah, and the third \add part\add* of a hin of oil, to temper with the fine flour; a meat offering continually \add by\add* a perpetual ordinance unto the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\v 15 Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meat offering, and the oil, every morning \add for\add* a continual burnt offering. 
\p
\v 16 Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; If the prince give a gift unto any of his sons, the inheritance thereof shall be his sons’; it \add shall be\add* their possession by inheritance. 
\v 17 But if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants, then it shall be his to the year of liberty; after, it shall return to the prince: but his inheritance shall be his sons’ for them. 
\v 18 Moreover the prince shall not take the people’s inheritance, by oppression to thrust them out of their possession; \add but\add* he shall give his sons inheritance out of his own possession: that my people be not scattered every man from his possession. 
\p
\v 19 After, he brought me through the entry, which \add was\add* at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers of the priests, which looked toward the north: and behold, there \add was\add* a place on the two sides westward. 
\v 20 Then said he unto me, This \add is\add* the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, where they shall bake the meat offering; that \add they\add* bear \add them\add* not out into the utter court, to sanctify the people. 
\v 21 Then he brought me forth into the utter court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and behold, in every corner of the court \add there was\add* a court. 
\v 22 In the four corners of the court \add there were\add* courts joined \add of\add* forty \add cubits\add* long and thirty broad: these four corners \add were\add* of one measure. 
\v 23 And \add there was\add* a row \add of building\add* round about in them, round about them four, and \add it was\add* made \add with\add* boiling places under the rows round about. 
\v 24 Then said he unto me, These \add are\add* the places of them that boil, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people. 
\c 47  
\p
\v 1 Afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house; and behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward: for the forefront of the house \add stood toward\add* the east, and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house, at the south \add side\add* of the altar. 
\v 2 Then brought he me out \add of\add* the way of the gate northward, and led me about the way without unto the utter gate \add by\add* the way that looketh east\add ward;\add* and behold, there ran out waters on the right side. 
\v 3 And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth east\add ward\add*, he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the waters \add were\add* to the ankles. 
\v 4 Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through the waters; the waters \add were to\add* the knees. Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through; the waters \add were\add* to the loins. 
\v 5 Afterward he measured a thousand; \add and it was\add* a river that I could not pass over: for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed over. 
\p
\v 6 And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen \add this?\add* Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the brink of the river. 
\v 7 Now when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river \add were\add* very many trees on the one side and on the other. 
\v 8 Then said he unto me, These waters issue out toward the east country, and go down into the desert, and go into the sea: \add which\add* being brought forth into the sea, the waters shall be healed. 
\v 9 And it shall come to pass, \add that\add* every thing that liveth, which moveth, whithersoever the rivers shall come, shall live: and there shall be a very great multitude of fish, because these waters shall come thither: for they shall be healed; and every \add thing\add* shall live whither the river cometh. 
\v 10 And it shall come to pass, \add that\add* the fishers shall stand upon it from En-gedi even unto En-eglaim; they shall be a place to spread forth nets; their fish shall be according to their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many. 
\v 11 But the miry places thereof and the marishes thereof shall not be healed; they shall be given to salt. 
\v 12 And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow all trees for meat, whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed: it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months, because their waters they issued out of the sanctuary: and the fruit thereof shall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for medicine. 
\p
\v 13 Thus saith the Lord \sc God\sc*; This \add shall be\add* the border, whereby ye shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph \add shall have two\add* portions. 
\v 14 And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another: \add concerning\add* the which I lifted up mine hand to give it unto your fathers: and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance. 
\v 15 And this \add shall be\add* the border of the land toward the north side, from the great sea, the way of Hethlon, as \add men\add* go to Zedad; 
\v 16 Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which \add is\add* between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazar-hatticon, which \add is\add* by the coast of Hauran. 
\v 17 And the border from the sea shall be Hazar-enan, the border of Damascus, and the north northward, and the border of Hamath. And \add this is\add* the north side.

\v 22 And it shall come to pass, \add that\add* ye shall divide it \add by lot\add* for an inheritance unto you, and to the strangers that sojourn among you, which shall beget children among you: and they shall be unto you as born in the country among the children of Israel; they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel. 
\v 23 And it shall come to pass, \add that\add* in what tribe the stranger sojourneth, there shall ye give \add him\add* his inheritance, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*.

\v 1 Now these \add are\add* the names of the tribes. From the north end to the coast of the way of Hethlon, as \add one\add* goeth to Hamath, Hazar-enan, the border of Damascus northward, to the coast of Hamath; for these are his sides east \add and\add* west; a \add portion for\add* Dan. 
\v 2 And by the border of Dan, from the east side unto the west side, a \add portion for\add* Asher. 
\v 3 And by the border of Asher, from the east side even unto the west side, a \add portion for\add* Naphtali.

\v 11  \add It shall be\add* for the priests that are sanctified of the sons of Zadok; which have kept my charge, which went not astray when the children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray. 
\v 12 And \add this\add* oblation of the land that is offered shall be unto them \add a thing\add* most holy by the border of the Levites. 
\v 13 And over against the border of the priests, the Levites \add shall have\add* five and twenty thousand \add in\add* length, and ten thousand \add in\add* breadth: all the length \add shall be\add* five and twenty thousand, and the breadth ten thousand. 
\v 14 And they shall not sell of it, neither exchange, nor alienate the firstfruits of the land: for \add it is\add* holy unto the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\p
\v 15 And the five thousand, that are left in the breadth over against the five and twenty thousand, \add shall be\add* a profane \add place\add* for the city, for dwelling, and for suburbs: and the city shall be in the midst thereof. 
\v 16 And these \add shall be\add* the measures thereof; the north side four thousand and five hundred, and the south side four thousand and five hundred, and on the east side four thousand and five hundred, and the west side four thousand and five hundred. 
\v 17 And the suburbs of the city shall be toward the north two hundred and fifty, and toward the south two hundred and fifty, and toward the east two hundred and fifty, and toward the west two hundred and fifty. 
\v 18 And the residue in length over against the oblation of the holy \add portion shall be\add* ten thousand eastward, and ten thousand westward: and it shall be over against the oblation of the holy \add portion;\add* and the increase thereof shall be for food unto them that serve the city. 
\v 19 And they that serve the city shall serve it out of all the tribes of Israel. 
\v 20 All the oblation \add shall be\add* five and twenty thousand by five and twenty thousand: ye shall offer the holy oblation foursquare, with the possession of the city. 
\v 21 And the residue \add shall be\add* for the prince, on the one side and on the other of the holy oblation, and of the possession of the city, over against the five and twenty thousand of the oblation toward the east border, and westward over against the five and twenty thousand toward the west border, over against the portions for the prince: and it shall be the holy oblation; and the sanctuary of the house \add shall be\add* in the midst thereof. 
\v 22 Moreover from the possession of the Levites, \add and\add* from the possession of the city, \add being\add* in the midst \add of that\add* which is the prince’s, between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin, shall be for the prince.

\v 29 This \add is\add* the land which ye shall divide \add by lot\add* unto the tribes of Israel for inheritance, and these \add are\add* their portions, saith the Lord \sc God\sc*. 
\p
\v 30 And these \add are\add* the goings out of the city: on the north side, four thousand and five hundred measures. 
\v 31 And the gates of the city \add shall be\add* after the names of the tribes of Israel: three gates northward; one gate of Reuben, one gate of Judah, one gate of Levi. 
\v 32 And at the east side four thousand and five hundred: and three gates; and one gate of Joseph, one gate of Benjamin, one gate of Dan. 
\v 33 And \add at\add* the south side four thousand and five hundred measures: and three gates; one gate of Simeon, one gate of Issachar, one gate of Zebulun.
