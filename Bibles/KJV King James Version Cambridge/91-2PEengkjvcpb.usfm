\mt2 THE SECOND EPISTLE GENERAL OF 
\mt1 PETER. 
\c 1  
\m
\v 1  \sc Simon\sc* Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ: 
\v 2 Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord. 
\p
\v 3 According as his divine power hath given unto us all \add things\add* that \add pertain\add* unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue: 
\v 4 whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust: 
\v 5 and beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; 
\v 6 and to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; 
\v 7 and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity. 
\v 8 For if these \add things\add* be in you, and abound, they make \add you that ye shall\add* neither \add be\add* barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
\v 9 But he that lacketh these \add things\add* is blind, and cannot see far off, and hath forgotten that \add he\add* was purged from his old sins. 
\v 10 Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these \add things\add*, ye shall never fall: 
\v 11 for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. 
\p
\v 12 Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these \add things\add*, though ye know \add them\add*, and be stablished in the present truth. 
\v 13 Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting \add you\add* in remembrance; 
\v 14 knowing that shortly \add I\add* must put off \add this\add* my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me. 
\v 15 Moreover I will endeavour that you may be able after my decease to have these \add things\add* always in remembrance. 
\v 16 For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty. 
\v 17 For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. 
\v 18 And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount. 
\v 19 We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts: 
\v 20 knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of \add any\add* private interpretation. 
\v 21 For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake \add as they were\add* moved by the Holy Ghost. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction. 
\v 2 And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of. 
\v 3 And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not. 
\v 4 For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast \add them\add* down to hell, and delivered \add them\add* into chains of darkness, \add to be\add* reserved unto judgment; 
\v 5 and spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth \add person\add*, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly; 
\v 6 and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned \add them\add* with an overthrow, making \add them\add* an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly; 
\v 7 and delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked: 
\v 8 (for \add that\add* righteous \add man\add* dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed \add his\add* righteous soul from day to day with \add their\add* unlawful deeds;) 
\v 9 the Lord knoweth \add how\add* to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment \add to be\add* punished: 
\v 10 but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous \add are they\add*, selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities. 
\v 11 Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord. 
\v 12 But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of \add the things\add* that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption; 
\v 13 and shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, \add as\add* they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots \add they are\add* and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you; 
\v 14 having eyes full of adultery and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: a heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children: 
\v 15 which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam \add the son\add* of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness; 
\v 16 but was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with manâ€™s voice forbad the madness of the prophet. 
\v 17 These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever. 
\v 18 For when they speak great swelling \add words\add* of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error. 
\v 19 While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage. 
\v 20 For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter \add end\add* is worse with them than the beginning. 
\v 21 For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known \add it\add*, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them. 
\v 22 But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog \add is\add* turned to his own vomit again; and, The sow that was washed to \add her\add* wallowing in the mire. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance: 
\v 2 that \add ye\add* may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour: 
\v 3 knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, 
\v 4 and saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all \add things\add* continue as \add they were\add* from the beginning of the creation. 
\v 5 For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water: 
\v 6 whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished: 
\v 7 but the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men. 
\v 8 But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one \add thing\add*, that one day \add is\add* with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. 
\v 9 The Lord is not slack concerning \add his\add* promise, as some \add men\add* count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. 
\v 10 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burnt up. 
\v 11 Seeing then that all these \add things shall\add* be dissolved, what manner \add of persons\add* ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness, 
\v 12 looking for and hasting \add unto\add* the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat? 
\v 13 Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness. 
\v 14 Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such \add things\add*, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless. 
\v 15 And account \add that\add* the longsuffering of our Lord \add is\add* salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you; 
\v 16 as also in all \add his\add* epistles, speaking in them of these \add things;\add* in which are some \add things\add* hard to be understood, which \add they that are\add* unlearned and unstable wrest, as \add they do\add* also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction. 
\v 17 Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know \add these things\add* before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness. 
\v 18 But grow in grace, and \add in\add* the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him \add be\add* glory both now and for ever. Amen.
