\v 1  \sc The\sc* second book of the prophet Esdras, the son of Saraias, the son of Azarias, the son of Helchias, the son of Sadamias, the son of Sadoc, the son of Achitob, 
\v 2 the son of Achias, the son of Phinees, the son of Heli, the son of Amarias, the son of Aziei, the son of Marimoth, the son of Arna, the son of Ozias, the son of Borith, the son of Abisei, the son of Phinees, the son of Eleazar, 
\v 3 the son of Aaron, of the tribe of Levi; which was captive in the land of the Medes, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of the Persians. 
\p
\v 4 And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
\v 5 Go \add thy way\add*, and shew my people their sinful deeds, and their children \add their\add* wickedness which they have done against me; that they may tell \add their\add* children’s children: 
\v 6 because the sins of their fathers are increased in them: for they have forgotten me, and have offered unto strange gods. 
\v 7  \add Am\add* not I even \add he that\add* brought them out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage? but they have provoked me unto wrath, and despised my counsels. 
\v 8 Pull thou off then the hair of thy head, and cast all evil upon them, for they have not been obedient unto my law, but it is a rebellious people. 
\v 9 How long shall I forbear them, unto whom I have done so much good? 
\v 10 Many kings have I destroyed for their sakes; Pharaoh with his servants and all his power have I smitten down. 
\v 11 All the nations have I destroyed before them, and in the east I have scattered the people of two provinces, \add even\add* of Tyrus and Sidon, and have slain all their enemies. 
\v 12 Speak thou therefore unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord, 
\v 13 I led you through the sea, and in the beginning gave you a large and safe passage; I gave you Moses \add for\add* a leader, and Aaron \add for\add* a priest. 
\v 14 I gave you light in a pillar of fire, and great wonders have I done among you; yet have you forgotten me, saith the Lord. 
\v 15 Thus saith the Almighty Lord, The quails were as a token for you; I gave you tents for \add your\add* safeguard: nevertheless you murmured there, 
\v 16 and triumphed not in my name for the destruction of your enemies, but ever to this day do ye yet murmur. 
\v 17 Where are the benefits that I have done for you? when you were hungry \add and thirsty\add* in the wilderness, did you not cry unto me, 
\v 18 saying, Why hast thou brought us into this wilderness to kill us? it had been better for us to have served the Egyptians, than to die in this wilderness. 
\v 19  \add Then\add* had I pity upon your mournings, and gave you manna to eat; \add so\add* ye did eat angels’ bread. 
\v 20 When ye were thirsty, did I not cleave the rock, and waters flowed \add out\add* to your fill? for the heat I covered you with the leaves of the trees. 
\v 21 I divided amongst you a fruitful land, I cast out the Canaanites, the Pherezites, and the Philistines, before you: what shall I yet do more for you? saith the Lord. 
\v 22 Thus saith the Almighty Lord, When you were in the wilderness, in the river of the Amorites, being athirst, and blaspheming my name, 
\v 23 I gave you not fire for \add your\add* blasphemies, but cast a tree in the water, and made the river sweet. 
\v 24 What shall I do unto thee, O Jacob? thou, Juda, wouldest not obey \add me:\add* I will turn me to other nations, and unto those will I give my name, that they may keep my statutes. 
\v 25 Seeing ye have forsaken me, I will forsake you also; when ye desire me to be gracious unto you, I shall have no mercy \add upon you\add*. 
\v 26 Whensoever you shall call upon me, I will not hear you: for ye have defiled your hands with blood, and your feet are swift to commit manslaughter. 
\v 27 Ye have not as it were forsaken me, but your own selves, saith the Lord. 
\v 28 Thus saith the Almighty Lord, Have I not prayed you as a father \add his\add* sons, as a mother \add her\add* daughters, and a nurse her young babes, 
\v 29 that ye would be my people, and I \add should be\add* your God; that ye \add would be\add* my children, and I \add should be\add* your father? 
\v 30 I gathered you together, as a hen \add gathereth\add* her chickens under her wings: but now, what shall I do unto you? I will cast you out from my face. 
\v 31 When you offer unto me, I will turn my face from you: for your solemn feastdays, \add your\add* new moons, and \add your\add* circumcisions, have I forsaken. 
\v 32 I sent unto you my servants the prophets, whom ye have taken and slain, and torn their bodies in pieces, whose blood I will require \add of your hands\add*, saith the Lord. 
\v 33 Thus saith the Almighty Lord, Your house is desolate, I will cast you out as the wind \add doth\add* stubble. 
\v 34 And \add your\add* children shall not be fruitful; for they have despised my commandment, and done \add the thing\add* that \add is\add* evil before me. 
\v 35 Your houses will I give to a people that shall come; which not having heard \add of\add* me yet shall believe \add me;\add* to whom I have shewed no signs, \add yet\add* they shall do that I have commanded \add them\add*. 
\v 36 They have seen no prophets, yet they shall call their sins to remembrance, \add and acknowledge them\add*. 
\v 37 I take to witness the grace of the people to come, whose little ones rejoice in gladness: and though they have not seen me with bodily eyes, yet in spirit they believe \add the thing\add* that I say. 
\p
\v 38 And now, brother, behold what glory; and see the people that cometh from the east: 
\v 39 unto whom I will give for leaders, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Oseas, Amos, and Micheas, Joel, Abdias, and Jonas, 
\v 40 Nahum, and Abacuc, Sophonias, Aggeus, Zacharie, and Malachie, which is called also an angel of the Lord. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 Thus saith the Lord, I brought this people out of bondage, and I gave them \add my\add* commandments by my servants the prophets; whom they would not hear, but despised my counsels. 
\v 2 The mother that bare them saith unto them, Go \add your way\add*, ye children; for I am a widow and forsaken. 
\v 3 I brought you up with gladness; but with sorrow and heaviness have I lost you: for ye have sinned before the Lord your God, and done \add that thing\add* that is evil before him. 
\v 4 But what shall I now do unto you? I am a widow and forsaken: go \add your way\add*, O \add my\add* children, and ask mercy of the Lord. 
\v 5 As for me, O father, I call upon thee \add for\add* a witness over the mother of these children, which would not keep my covenant, 
\v 6 that thou bring them to confusion, and their mother to a spoil, that there may be no offspring of them. 
\v 7 Let them be scattered abroad among the heathen, let their names be put out of the earth: for they have despised my covenant. 
\v 8 Woe be unto thee, Assur, thou that hidest the unrighteous in thee! O \add thou\add* wicked people, remember what I did unto Sodom and Gomorrha; 
\v 9 whose land lieth in clods of pitch and heaps of ashes: \add even\add* so \add also\add* will I do unto them that hear me not, saith the Almighty Lord. 
\p
\v 10 Thus saith the Lord unto Esdras, Tell my people that I will give them the kingdom of Jerusalem, which I would have given unto Israel. 
\v 11 Their glory also will I take unto me, and give these the everlasting tabernacles, which I had prepared for them. 
\v 12 They shall have the tree of life for an ointment of sweet savour; they shall neither labour, nor be weary. 
\v 13 Go, and ye shall receive: pray for few days unto you, that they may be shortened: the kingdom is already prepared for you: watch. 
\v 14 Take heaven and earth to witness; for I have broken the evil in pieces, and created the good: for I live, saith the Lord. 
\p
\v 15 Mother, embrace thy children, \add and\add* bring them up with gladness, make their feet as fast as a pillar: for I have chosen thee, saith the Lord. 
\v 16 And those that be dead will I raise up again from their places, and bring them out of the graves: for I have known my name in Israel. 
\v 17 Fear not, \add thou\add* mother of the children: for I have chosen thee, saith the Lord. 
\v 18  \add For\add* thy help I will send my servants Esay and Jeremie, after whose counsel I have sanctified and prepared for thee twelve trees laden with divers fruits, 
\v 19 and as many fountains flowing \add with\add* milk and honey, and seven mighty mountains, whereupon there grow roses and lilies, whereby I will fill thy children with joy. 
\v 20 Do right to the widow, judge for the fatherless, give to the poor, defend the orphan, clothe the naked, 
\v 21 heal the broken and the weak, laugh not a lame \add man\add* to scorn, defend the maimed, and let the blind \add man\add* come into the sight of my clearness. 
\v 22 Keep the old and young within thy walls. 
\v 23 Wheresoever thou findest the dead, take \add them\add* and bury \add them\add*, and I will give thee the first place in my resurrection. 
\v 24 Abide still, O my people, and take thy rest, for thy quietness shall come. 
\v 25 Nourish thy children, O \add thou\add* good nurse; stablish their feet. 
\v 26  \add As for\add* the servants whom I have given thee, there shall not one of them perish; for I will require them from among thy number. 
\v 27 Be not weary: for when the day of trouble and heaviness cometh, others shall weep and be sorrowful, but thou shalt be merry and have abundance. 
\v 28 The heathen shall envy \add thee\add*, but they shall be able to do nothing against thee, saith the Lord. 
\v 29 My hands shall cover thee, so that thy children shall not see hell. 
\v 30 Be joyful, O \add thou\add* mother, with thy children; for I will deliver thee, saith the Lord. 
\v 31 Remember thy children that sleep, for I shall bring them out of the sides of the earth, and shew mercy unto them: for I am merciful, saith the Lord Almighty. 
\v 32 Embrace thy children until I come and shew mercy unto them: for my wells run over, and my grace shall not fail. 
\p
\v 33 I Esdras received a charge of the Lord upon the mount Oreb, that I should go unto Israel; but when I came unto them, they set me at nought, and despised the commandment of the Lord. 
\v 34 And therefore I say unto you, O \add ye\add* heathen, that hear and understand, look for your Shepherd, he shall give you everlasting rest; for he is nigh at hand, that shall come in the end of the world. 
\v 35 Be ready to the reward of the kingdom, for the everlasting light shall shine upon you for evermore. 
\v 36 Flee the shadow of this world, receive the joyfulness of your glory: I testify my Saviour openly. 
\v 37 O receive the gift that is given \add you\add*, and be glad, giving thanks unto him that hath called you to the heavenly kingdom. 
\v 38 Arise up and stand, behold the number of those that be sealed in the feast of the Lord; 
\v 39 which are departed from the shadow of the world, \add and\add* have received glorious garments of the Lord. 
\v 40 Take thy number, O Sion, and shut up those of thine that are clothed in white, which have fulfilled the law of the Lord. 
\v 41 The number of thy children, whom thou longedst for, is fulfilled: beseech the power of the Lord, that thy people, which have been called from the beginning, may be hallowed. 
\p
\v 42 I Esdras saw upon the mount Sion a great people, whom I could not number, and they all praised the Lord with songs. 
\v 43 And in the midst of them there was a young man of a high stature, taller than all the rest, and upon every one of their heads he set crowns, and was more exalted; which I marvelled at greatly. 
\v 44 So I asked the angel, and said, Sir, what are these? 
\v 45 He answered and said unto me, These be they that have put off the mortal clothing, and put on the immortal, and have confessed the name of God: now are they crowned, and receive palms. 
\v 46 Then said I unto the angel, What young person is it that crowneth them, and giveth \add them\add* palms in \add their\add* hands? 
\v 47 So he answered and said unto me, It is the Son of God, whom they have confessed in the world. Then began I greatly to commend them that stood \add so\add* stiffly for the name of the Lord. 
\v 48 Then the angel said unto me, Go \add thy way\add*, and tell my people what manner of \add things\add*, and how great wonders of the Lord \add thy\add* God thou hast seen. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 In the thirtieth year after the ruin of the city I was in Babylon, and lay troubled upon my bed, and my thoughts came up over my heart: 
\v 2 for I saw the desolation of Sion, and the wealth of them that dwelt at Babylon. 
\v 3 And my spirit was sore moved, so that I began to speak words full of fear to the most High, and said, 
\p
\v 4 O Lord, who bearest rule, thou spakest at the beginning, when thou didst plant the earth, and that \add thyself\add* alone, and commandedst the people, 
\v 5 and gavest a body unto Adam without soul, which was the workmanship of thine hands, and didst breathe into him the breath of life, and he was made living before thee. 
\v 6 And thou leddest him into paradise, which thy right hand had planted, before ever the earth came forward. 
\v 7 And unto him thou gavest commandment to love thy way: which he transgressed, and immediately thou appointedst death in him and in his generations, of whom came nations, tribes, people, and kindreds, out of number. 
\v 8 And every people walked after their own will, and did wonderful \add things\add* before thee, and despised thy commandments. 
\v 9 And again in process of time thou broughtest the flood upon those that dwelt in the world, and destroyedst them. 
\v 10 And it came to pass in every of them, that as death \add was\add* to Adam, so \add was\add* the flood to these. 
\v 11 Nevertheless one of them thou leftest, namely, Noah with his household, of whom \add came\add* all righteous \add men\add*. 
\v 12 And it happened, that when they that dwelt upon the earth began to multiply, and had gotten them many children, and were a great people, they began again to be more ungodly than the first. 
\v 13 Now when they lived \add so\add* wickedly before thee, thou didst choose thee a man from among them, whose name was Abraham. 
\v 14 Him thou lovedst, and unto him only thou shewedst thy will: 
\v 15 and madest an everlasting covenant with him, promising him that thou wouldest never forsake his seed. 
\v 16 And unto him thou gavest Isaac, and unto Isaac \add also\add* thou gavest Jacob and Esau. \add As for\add* Jacob, thou didst choose \add him\add* to thee, and put by Esau: and \add so\add* Jacob became a great multitude. 
\v 17 And it came to pass, \add that\add* when thou leddest his seed out of Egypt, thou broughtest \add them\add* up to the mount Sina. 
\v 18 And bowing the heavens, thou didst set fast the earth, movedst the \add whole\add* world, and madest the depths to tremble, and troubledst the \add men of that\add* age. 
\v 19 And thy glory went through four gates, of fire, and of earthquake, and of wind, and of cold; that thou mightest give the law unto the seed of Jacob, and diligence unto the generation of Israel. 
\v 20 And \add yet\add* tookest thou not away from them a wicked heart, that thy law might bring forth fruit in them. 
\v 21 For the first Adam bearing a wicked heart transgressed, and was overcome; and so \add be\add* all \add they\add* that are born of him. 
\v 22 Thus infirmity was made permanent; and the law \add also\add* in the heart of the people with the malignity of the root; so that the good departed away, and the evil abode \add still\add*. 
\v 23 So the times passed away, and the years were brought to an end: then didst thou raise thee up a servant, called David: 
\v 24 whom thou commandedst to build a city unto thy name, and to offer incense and oblations unto thee therein. 
\v 25 When this was done many years, then they that inhabited the city forsook \add thee\add*, 
\v 26 and in all \add things\add* did even as Adam and all his generations had done: for they also had a wicked heart: 
\v 27 and \add so\add* thou gavest thy city over into the hands of thine enemies. 
\v 28 Are their deeds then any better that inhabit Babylon, that they should therefore have the dominion over Sion? 
\v 29 For when I came thither, and had seen impieties without number, then my soul saw many evildoers in this thirtieth year, so that my heart failed me. 
\v 30 For I have seen how thou sufferest them sinning, and hast spared wicked doers: and hast destroyed thy people, and hast preserved thine enemies, and hast not signified \add it\add*. 
\v 31 I do not remember how this way may be left: Are they then of Babylon better than they of Sion? 
\v 32 Or \add is there\add* any other people \add that\add* knoweth thee besides Israel? or what generation hath so believed thy covenants as Jacob? 
\v 33 And yet their reward appeareth not, and \add their\add* labour hath no fruit: for I have gone here and there through the heathen, and I see that they flow in wealth, and think not upon thy commandments. 
\v 34 Weigh thou therefore our wickedness now in the balance, and theirs \add also\add* that dwell in the world; and \add so\add* shall thy name no where be found but in Israel. 
\v 35 Or when \add was it that\add* they which dwell upon the earth have not sinned in thy sight? or what people hath so kept thy commandments? 
\v 36 Thou shalt find that Israel by name hath kept thy precepts; but not the heathen. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 And the angel that was sent unto me, whose name was Uriel, gave me an answer, 
\v 2 and said, Thy heart hath gone too far in this world, and thinkest thou to comprehend the way of the most High? 
\v 3 Then said I, Yea, my Lord. And he answered me, and said, I am sent to shew thee three ways, and to set forth three similitudes before thee: 
\v 4 whereof if thou canst declare me one, I will shew thee also the way that thou desirest to see, and I shall shew thee from whence the wicked heart cometh. 
\v 5 And I said, Tell \add on\add*, my Lord. Then said he unto me; Go \add thy way\add*, weigh me the weight of the fire, or measure me the blast of the wind, or call me again the day that is past. 
\v 6 Then answered I and said, What man is able to do \add that\add*, that thou shouldest ask such \add things\add* of me? 
\v 7 And he said unto me, If I should ask thee how great dwellings are in the midst of the sea, or how many springs are in the beginning of the deep, or how many springs are above the firmament, or which are the outgoings of paradise: 
\v 8 peradventure thou wouldest say unto me, I never went down into the deep, nor as yet into hell, neither did I ever climb up into heaven. 
\v 9 Nevertheless now have I asked thee but only of the fire and wind, and \add of\add* the day wherethrough thou hast passed, and \add of things\add* from which thou canst not be separated, and \add yet\add* canst thou give me no answer of them. 
\v 10 He said moreover unto me, Thine own \add things\add*, and such as are grown up with thee, canst thou not know; 
\v 11 how should thy vessel then be able to comprehend the way of the Highest, and, the world being now outwardly corrupted, to understand the corruption that is evident in my sight? 
\v 12 Then said I unto him, It were better that we were not \add at all\add*, than that we should live still in wickedness, and to suffer, and not to know wherefore. 
\p
\v 13 He answered me, and said, I went into a forest into a plain, and the trees took counsel, 
\v 14 and said, Come, let us go and make war against the sea, that it may depart away before us, and that we may make us more woods. 
\v 15 The floods of the sea also in like manner took counsel, and said, Come, let us go up and subdue the woods of the plain, that there also we may make us another country. 
\v 16 The thought of the wood was in vain, for the fire came and consumed it. 
\v 17 The thought of the floods of the sea \add came\add* likewise \add to nought\add*, for the sand stood \add up\add* and stopped them. 
\v 18 If thou wert judge now betwixt these \add two\add*, whom wouldest thou begin to justify? or whom wouldest thou condemn? 
\v 19 I answered and said, Verily \add it is\add* a foolish thought \add that\add* they \add both\add* have devised, for the ground is given unto the wood, and the sea \add also hath his\add* place to bear his floods. 
\v 20 Then answered he me, and said, Thou hast given a right judgment, but why judgest thou not thyself also? 
\v 21 For like as the ground is given unto the wood, and the sea to his floods: \add even\add* so they that dwell upon the earth may understand nothing but \add that\add* which is upon the earth: and he \add that dwelleth\add* above the heavens \add may only understand the things\add* that \add are\add* above the height of the heavens. 
\v 22 Then answered I and said, I beseech thee, O Lord, let me have understanding: 
\v 23 for it was not my mind to be curious of the high \add things\add*, but of such as pass by us daily, \add namely\add*, wherefore Israel \add is\add* given up as a reproach to the heathen, \add and for what cause\add* the people whom thou hast loved is given over unto ungodly nations, and \add why\add* the law of our forefathers is brought to nought, and the written covenants come to none effect, 
\v 24 and we pass away out of the world as grasshoppers, and our life \add is\add* astonishment and fear, and we are not worthy to obtain mercy. 
\v 25 What will he then do unto his name whereby we are called? of these \add things\add* have I asked. 
\p
\v 26 Then answered he me, and said, The more thou searchest, the more thou shalt marvel; for the world hasteth fast to pass away, 
\v 27 and cannot comprehend \add the things\add* that are promised to the righteous in time to come: for this world is full of unrighteousness and infirmities. 
\v 28 But as concerning \add the things\add* whereof thou askest \add me\add*, I will tell \add thee;\add* for the evil is sown, but the destruction thereof is not yet come. 
\v 29 If therefore \add that\add* which is sown be not turned upside down, and \add if\add* the place where the evil is sown pass \add not\add* away, \add then\add* cannot it come that is sown \add with\add* good. 
\v 30 For the grain of evil seed hath been sown in the heart of Adam from the beginning, and how much ungodliness hath it brought up unto this time? and \add how much\add* shall it \add yet\add* bring forth until the time of threshing come? 
\v 31 Ponder now by thyself, how great fruit of wickedness the grain of evil seed hath brought forth. 
\v 32  \add And\add* when the ears shall be cut down, which are without number, how great a floor shall they fill? 
\v 33 Then I answered and said, How and when shall these \add things come to pass?\add* wherefore \add are\add* our years few and evil? 
\v 34 And he answered me, saying, Do not thou hasten above the most High\add est:\add* for thy haste is in vain to be above him, for thou hast much exceeded. 
\v 35 Did not the souls \add also\add* of the righteous ask question of these \add things\add* in their chambers, saying, How long shall I hope on this fashion? when cometh the fruit of the floor of our reward? 
\v 36 And unto these \add things\add* Uriel the archangel gave \add them\add* answer, and said, \add Even\add* when the number of seeds is filled in you: for he hath weighed the world in the balance. 
\v 37 By measure hath he measured the times, and by number hath he numbered the times; and he doth not move nor stir \add them\add*, until the said measure be fulfilled. 
\v 38 Then answered I and said, O Lord that bearest rule, even we all are full of impiety. 
\v 39 And for our sakes peradventure \add it is that\add* the floors of the righteous are not filled, because of the sins of them that dwell upon the earth. 
\v 40 So he answered me, and said, Go \add thy way\add* to a woman with child, and ask of her when she hath fulfilled her nine months, if her womb may keep the birth any longer within her. 
\v 41 Then said I, No, Lord, that can she not. And he said unto me, In the grave the chambers of souls are like the womb \add of a woman:\add* 
\v 42 for like as a woman that travaileth maketh haste to escape the necessity of the travail: even so do these \add places\add* haste to deliver those \add things\add* that are committed \add unto them\add*. 
\v 43 From the beginning, \add look\add*, what thou desirest to see, it shall be shewed \add thee\add*. 
\p
\v 44 Then answered I and said, If I have found favour in thy sight, and if it be possible, and if I be meet \add therefore\add*, 
\v 45 shew me \add then\add* whether there be more to come than is past, or more past than is to come. 
\v 46 What is past I know, but what is for to come I know not. 
\v 47 And he said unto me, Stand \add up\add* upon the right side, and I shall expound the similitude unto thee. 
\v 48 So I stood, and saw, and behold, a hot burning oven passed by before me: and it happened, \add that\add* when the flame was gone by, I looked, and behold, the smoke remained still. 
\v 49 After this there passed by before me a watery cloud, and sent down much rain with a storm; and when the stormy rain was past, the drops remained still. 
\v 50 Then said he unto me, Consider with thyself; as the rain is more than the drops, and \add as\add* the fire \add is greater\add* than the smoke; but the drops and the smoke remain behind: so the quantity which is past did more exceed. 
\v 51 Then I prayed, and said, May I live, thinkest thou, until that time? or what shall happen in those days? 
\v 52 He answered me, and said, As for the tokens whereof thou askest me, I may tell thee \add of them\add* in part: but as touching thy life, I am not sent to shew thee; for I do not know \add it\add*. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 Nevertheless as concerning the tokens, behold, the days shall come, that \add they\add* which dwell upon earth shall be taken in a great number, and the way of truth shall be hidden, and the land shall be barren of faith. 
\v 2 But iniquity shall be increased above that which \add now\add* thou seest, or that thou hast heard long ago. 
\v 3 And the land, that thou seest now to have root, shalt thou see wasted \add suddenly\add*. 
\v 4 But if the most High grant thee to live, thou shalt see after the third trumpet that the sun shall suddenly shine again in the night, and the moon thrice in the day: 
\v 5 and blood shall drop out of wood, and the stone shall give his voice, and the people shall be troubled: 
\v 6 and \add even\add* he shall rule, whom they look not for that dwell upon the earth, and the fowls shall take their flight away together: 
\v 7 and the Sodomitish sea shall cast out fish, and make a noise in the night, which many have not known: but they shall all hear the voice thereof. 
\v 8 There shall be a confusion also in many places, and the fire shall be oft sent out again, and the wild beasts shall change their places, and menstruous women shall bring forth monsters: 
\v 9 and salt waters shall be found in the sweet, and all friends shall destroy one another; then shall wit hide itself, and understanding withdraw itself into his secret chamber, 
\v 10 and shall be sought of many, and \add yet\add* not be found: then shall unrighteousness and incontinency be multiplied upon earth. 
\v 11  \add One\add* land also shall ask another, and say, Is righteousness that maketh \add a man\add* righteous gone through thee? And it shall say, No. 
\v 12 At the same time shall men hope, but nothing obtain: they shall labour, but their ways shall not prosper. 
\v 13 To shew thee such tokens I have leave; and if thou wilt pray again, and weep as now, and fast seven days, thou shalt hear yet greater \add things\add*. 
\v 14 Then I awaked, and an extreme fearfulness went through all my body, and my mind was troubled, so that it fainted. 
\v 15 So the angel that was come to talk with me held me, comforted me, and set me \add up\add* upon \add my\add* feet. 
\v 16 And in the second night it came to pass, that Salathiel the captain of the people came unto me, saying, Where hast thou been? and why \add is\add* thy countenance \add so\add* heavy? 
\v 17 Knowest thou not that Israel is committed unto thee in the land of their captivity? 
\v 18 Up then, and eat bread, and forsake us not, as the shepherd \add that leaveth\add* his flock in the hands of cruel wolves. 
\v 19 Then said I unto him, Go \add thy ways\add* from me, and come not nigh me. And he heard what I said, and went from me. 
\p
\v 20 And \add so\add* I fasted seven days, mourning and weeping, like as Uriel the angel commanded me. 
\v 21 And after seven days so it was, that the thoughts of my heart were very grievous unto me again, 
\v 22 and my soul recovered the spirit of understanding, and I began to talk with the most High again, and said, 
\p
\v 23 O Lord that bearest rule, of every wood of the earth, and \add of\add* all the trees thereof, thou hast chosen \add thee\add* one only vine: 
\v 24 and of all lands of the \add whole\add* world thou hast chosen thee one pit: and of all the flowers thereof one lily: 
\v 25 and of all the depths of the sea thou hast filled thee one river: and of all builded cities thou hast hallowed Sion unto thyself: 
\v 26 and of all the fowls that are created thou hast named thee one dove: and of all the cattle that are made thou hast provided thee one sheep: 
\v 27 and among all the multitudes of peoples thou hast gotten thee one people: and unto this people, whom thou lovedst, thou gavest a law that is approved of all. 
\v 28 And now, O Lord, why hast thou given \add this\add* one \add people\add* over unto many? and upon the one root hast thou prepared others, and \add why\add* hast thou scattered thy only one \add people\add* among many? 
\v 29 And they which did gainsay thy promises, and believed not thy covenants, have trodden them down. 
\v 30 If thou didst so much hate thy people, \add yet\add* shouldest \add thou\add* punish \add them\add* with thine own hands. 
\p
\v 31 Now when I had spoken \add these\add* words, the angel that came to me the night afore was sent unto me, 
\v 32 and said unto me, Hear me, and I will instruct thee; hearken to the thing that I say, and I shall tell thee more. 
\v 33 And I said, Speak \add on\add*, my Lord. Then said he unto me, Thou art sore troubled in mind for Israel’s sake: lovest thou that \add people\add* better than \add he\add* that made them? 
\v 34 And I said, No, Lord: but of very grief have I spoken: for my reins pain me every hour, while I labour to comprehend the way of the most High, and to seek out part of his judgment. 
\v 35 And he said unto me, Thou canst not. And I said, Wherefore, Lord? whereunto was I born \add then?\add* or why was not my mother’s womb \add then\add* my grave, that I might not have seen the travail of Jacob, and the wearisome toil of the stock of Israel? 
\v 36 And he said unto me, Number me \add the things\add* that are not yet come, gather me together the drops that are scattered abroad, make me the flowers green again \add that are\add* withered, 
\v 37 open me the places that are closed, and bring me forth the winds that in them are shut up, shew me the image of a voice: and then I will declare to thee the thing that thou labourest to know. 
\v 38 And I said, O Lord that bearest rule, who may know these \add things\add*, but \add he\add* that hath not his dwelling with men? 
\v 39 As for me, \add I am\add* unwise: how may I then speak of these \add things\add* whereof thou askest me? 
\v 40 Then said he unto me, Like as thou canst do none of these \add things\add* that \add I\add* have spoken of, \add even\add* so canst thou not find out my judgment, or in the end the love that I have promised unto \add my\add* people. 
\v 41 And I said, Behold, O Lord, yet art thou nigh unto them that be \add reserved\add* till the end: and what shall they do that have been before me, or we \add that be now\add*, or they that \add shall come\add* after us? 
\v 42 And he said unto me, I will liken my judgment unto a ring: like as \add there is\add* no slackness of the last, \add even\add* so \add there is\add* no swiftness of the first. 
\v 43 So I answered and said, Couldest thou not make those that have been made, and be \add now\add*, and that are for to come, at once; that thou mightest shew thy judgment the sooner? 
\v 44 Then answered he me, and said, The creature may not haste above the Maker; neither \add may\add* the world hold them at once that shall be created therein. 
\v 45 And I said, As thou hast said unto thy servant, that thou, which givest life \add to all\add*, hast given life at once to the creature that thou hast created, and the creature bare \add it: even so\add* it might now also bear them that \add now\add* be present at once. 
\v 46 And he said unto me, Ask the womb of a woman, and say unto her, If thou bringest forth children, why \add dost thou it not together, but\add* one after another? pray her therefore to bring forth ten \add children\add* at once. 
\v 47 And I said, She cannot: but \add must do it\add* by distance of time. 
\v 48 Then said he unto me, Even \add so\add* have I given the womb of the earth to those that be sown in it in \add their\add* times. 
\v 49 For like as a young child may not bring forth \add the things\add* that belong to the aged, \add even\add* so have I disposed the world which I created. 
\v 50 And I asked, and said, Seeing thou hast now given me the way, I will \add proceed to\add* speak before thee: for our mother, of whom thou hast told me \add that\add* she is young, draweth now nigh unto age. 
\v 51 He answered me, and said, Ask a woman that beareth children, and she shall tell thee. 
\v 52 Say unto her, Wherefore are not \add they\add* whom thou hast now brought forth like those that \add were\add* before, but less of stature? 
\v 53 And she shall answer thee, \add They\add* that be born in the strength of youth are of one fashion, and they that are born in the time of age, when the womb faileth, \add are\add* otherwise. 
\v 54 Consider thou therefore also, how that ye are less of stature than those that \add were\add* before you. 
\v 55 And \add so are they\add* that \add come\add* after you less than ye, as the creatures which now begin to be old, and have passed over the strength of youth. 
\v 56 Then said I, Lord, I beseech thee, if I have found favour in thy sight, shew thy servant by whom thou visitest thy creature. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1 And he said unto me, In the beginning, when the earth was made, before the borders of the world stood, or ever the winds blew, 
\v 2 before it thundered and lightened, or ever the foundations of paradise were laid, 
\v 3 before the fair flowers were seen, or ever the moveable powers were established, before the innumerable multitude of angels were gathered together, 
\v 4 or ever the heights of the air were lifted up, before the measures of the firmament were named, or ever the chimneys in Sion were hot, 
\v 5 and ere the present years were sought out, and or ever the inventions of them that now sin were turned, before they were sealed that have gathered faith for a treasure: 
\v 6 then did I consider \add these things\add*, and they \add all\add* were made through me alone, and through none other: by me also they shall be ended, and by none other. 
\v 7 Then answered I and said, What shall be the parting asunder of the times? or when \add shall be\add* the end of the first, and the beginning of it that followeth? 
\v 8 And he said unto me, From Abraham unto Isaac, when Jacob and Esau were born of him, Jacob’s hand held first the heel of Esau. 
\v 9 For Esau \add is\add* the end of the world, and Jacob \add is\add* the beginning of it that followeth. 
\v 10 The hand of man \add is\add* betwixt the heel and the hand: other \add question\add*, Esdras, ask thou not. 
\p
\v 11 I answered then and said, O Lord that bearest rule, if I have found favour in thy sight, 
\v 12 I beseech thee, shew thy servant the end of thy tokens, whereof thou shewedst me part the last night. 
\v 13 So he answered and said unto me, Stand up upon thy feet, and hear a mighty sounding voice. 
\v 14 And it shall be as it were a \add great\add* motion; but the place where thou standest shall not be moved. 
\v 15 And therefore when it speaketh be not afraid: for the word \add is\add* of the end, and the foundation of the earth is understood. 
\v 16  \add And why?\add* because the speech of these \add things\add* trembleth and is moved: for it knoweth that the end of these \add things\add* must be changed. 
\v 17 And it happened, \add that\add* when I had heard \add it\add* I stood up upon my feet, and hearkened, and behold, \add there was\add* a voice that spake, and the sound of it \add was\add* like the sound of many waters. 
\v 18 And it said, Behold, the days come, that I will begin to draw nigh, and to visit them that dwell upon the earth, 
\v 19 and will begin to make inquisition of them, \add what they be\add* that have hurt unjustly with their unrighteousness, and when the affliction of Sion shall be fulfilled; 
\v 20 and when the world, that shall begin to vanish away, shall be finished, \add then\add* will I shew these tokens: the books shall be opened before the firmament, and they shall see all together: 
\v 21 and the children of a year old shall speak with their voices, the women with child shall bring forth untimely children of three or four months old, and they shall live, and be raised up. 
\v 22 And suddenly shall the sown places appear unsown, the full storehouses shall suddenly be found empty: 
\v 23 and the trumpet shall give a sound, which when every \add man\add* heareth, they shall be suddenly afraid. 
\v 24 At that time shall friends fight one against another like enemies, and the earth shall stand in fear with those \add that dwell therein\add*, the springs of the fountains shall stand still, and in three hours they shall not run. 
\v 25 Whosoever remaineth from all these that I have told thee shall escape, and see my salvation, and the end of your world. 
\v 26 And the men that are received shall see \add it\add*, who have not tasted death from their birth: and the heart of the inhabitants shall be changed, and turned into another meaning. 
\v 27 For evil shall be put out, and deceit shall be quenched. 
\v 28 As for faith, it shall flourish, corruption shall be overcome, and the truth, which hath been so long without fruit, shall be declared. 
\p
\v 29 And when he talked with me, behold, I looked by little and little upon him before whom I stood. 
\v 30 And these \add words\add* said he unto me; I am come to shew thee the time of the night to come. 
\v 31 If thou wilt pray yet more, and fast seven days again, I shall tell thee greater \add things\add* by day than I have heard. 
\v 32 For thy voice is heard before the most High: for the Mighty hath seen thy righteous dealing, he hath seen also \add thy\add* chastity, which thou hast had ever since thy youth. 
\v 33 And therefore hath he sent me to shew thee all these \add things\add*, and to say unto thee, Be of good comfort, and fear not, 
\v 34 And hasten not, with the times that are past, to think vain \add things\add*, that thou mayest not hasten from the latter times. 
\p
\v 35 And it came to pass after this, that I wept again, and fasted seven days in like manner, that I might fulfil the three weeks which \add he\add* told me. 
\v 36 And in the eighth night was my heart vexed within me again, and I began to speak before the most High. 
\v 37 For my spirit was greatly set on fire, and my soul was in distress. 
\v 38 And I said, 
\p O Lord, thou spakest from the beginning of the creation, even the first day, and saidst thus; Let heaven and earth be made; and thy word \add was\add* a perfect work. 
\v 39 And then was the Spirit, and darkness and silence were on every side; the sound of man’s voice was not yet formed. 
\v 40 Then commandedst thou a fair light to come forth of thy treasures, that thy work might appear. 
\v 41 Upon the second day thou madest the spirit of the firmament, and commandedst it to part asunder and to make a division betwixt the waters, that the one part might go up, and the other remain beneath. 
\v 42 Upon the third day thou didst command that the waters should be gathered in the seventh part of the earth: six parts hast thou dried up, and kept \add them\add*, to the intent that of these \add some\add* being planted of God and tilled might serve thee. 
\v 43 For as soon as thy word went forth the work was made. 
\v 44 For immediately there was great and innumerable fruit, and many \add and\add* divers pleasures for the taste, and flowers of unchangeable colour, and odours of wonderful smell: and this was done the third day. 
\v 45 Upon the fourth day thou commandedst that the sun should shine, \add and\add* the moon give her light, \add and\add* the stars should be in order: 
\v 46 and gavest them a charge to do service unto man, that was to be made. 
\v 47 Upon the fifth day thou saidst unto the seventh part, where the waters were gathered, that it should bring forth living creatures, fowls and fishes: and so it came to pass. 
\v 48  \add For\add* the dumb water and without life brought forth living things at the commandment of God, that all people might praise thy wondrous works. 
\v 49 Then didst thou ordain two living creatures, the one thou calledst Enoch, and the other Leviathan; 
\v 50 and didst separate the one from the other: for the seventh part (\add namely\add*, where the water was gathered together) might not hold them \add both\add*. 
\v 51 Unto Enoch thou gavest one part, which was dried up the third day, that he should dwell in the same \add part\add*, wherein are a thousand hills: 
\v 52 but unto Leviathan thou gavest the seventh part, \add namely\add*, the moist; and hast kept him to be devoured of whom thou wilt, and when. 
\v 53 Upon the sixth day thou gavest commandment unto the earth, that before thee it should bring forth beasts, cattle, and creeping things: 
\v 54 and after these, Adam \add also\add*, whom thou madest lord of all thy creatures: of him come we all, and the people also whom thou hast chosen. 
\v 55 All this have I spoken before thee, O Lord, because thou madest the world for our sakes. 
\v 56 As for the other people, which \add also\add* come of Adam, thou hast said that they are nothing, but be like unto spittle: and hast likened the abundance of them unto a drop \add that falleth\add* from a vessel. 
\v 57 And now, O Lord, behold, these heathen, which have \add ever\add* been reputed as nothing, have begun to be lords over us, and to devour \add us\add*. 
\v 58 But we thy people, (whom thou hast called \add thy\add* firstborn, \add thy\add* only begotten, and thy fervent lover) are given into their hands. 
\v 59 If the world now be made for our sakes, why do we not possess an inheritance with the world? how long \add shall\add* this \add endure?\add* 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1 And when I had made an end of speaking these words, there was sent unto me the angel which had been sent unto me the nights afore: 
\v 2 and he said unto me, Up, Esdras, and hear the words that I am come to tell thee. 
\v 3 And I said, Speak \add on\add*, my God. Then said he unto me, The sea is set in a wide place, that it might be deep and great. 
\v 4 But put the case the entrance were narrow, and like a river; 
\v 5 who then could go into the sea to look upon it, and to rule it? if he went not through the narrow, how could he come into the broad? 
\v 6  \add There is\add* also another \add thing;\add* A city is builded, and set upon a broad field, and is full of all good \add things:\add* 
\v 7 the entrance thereof \add is\add* narrow, and \add is\add* set in a dangerous place to fall, like as if there were a fire on the right hand, \add and\add* on the left a deep water: 
\v 8 and one only path between them \add both\add*, even between the fire and the water, \add so small\add* that there could but one man go there at once. 
\v 9 If \add this\add* city now were given unto a man for an inheritance, if he never shall pass the danger set before \add it\add*, how shall he receive this inheritance? 
\v 10 And I said, \add It is\add* so, Lord. Then said he unto me, \add Even\add* so also is Israel’s portion. 
\v 11 Because for their sakes I made the world: and when Adam transgressed my statutes, \add then\add* was decreed that \add now\add* is done. 
\v 12 Then were the entrances of this world made narrow, full of sorrow and travail: they \add are\add* but few and evil, full of perils, and very painful. 
\v 13 For the entrances of the elder world \add were\add* wide and sure, and brought immortal fruit. 
\v 14 If then they that live labour not to enter these strait and vain \add things\add*, they can never receive \add those\add* that are laid up \add for them\add*. 
\v 15 Now therefore why disquietest thou thyself, seeing thou art \add but\add* a corruptible \add man?\add* and why art thou moved, whereas thou art \add but\add* mortal? 
\v 16 Why hast thou not considered in thy mind \add this thing\add* that is to come, rather than \add that\add* which is present? 
\v 17  \add Then\add* answered I and said, O Lord that bearest rule, thou hast ordained in thy law, that the righteous should inherit these \add things\add*, but \add that\add* the ungodly should perish. 
\v 18 Nevertheless the righteous shall suffer strait \add things\add*, and hope for wide: for they that have done wickedly have suffered the strait \add things\add*, and yet shall not see the wide. 
\v 19 And he said unto me, There is no judge above God, and none that hath understanding above the Highest. 
\v 20 For \add there be\add* many \add that\add* perish in this life, because they despise the law of God that is set before \add them\add*. 
\v 21 For God hath given strait commandment to such as came, what they should do to live, \add even\add* as they came, and what they should observe to avoid punishment. 
\v 22 Nevertheless they were not obedient \add unto him;\add* but spake against him, and imagined vain things; 
\v 23 and deceived themselves by their wicked deeds; and said \add of\add* the most High, that \add he\add* is not; and knew not his ways: 
\v 24 but his law have they despised, and denied his covenants: in his statutes have they not been faithful, and have not performed his works. 
\v 25  \add And\add* therefore, Esdras, for the empty \add are\add* empty \add things\add*, and for the full \add are\add* the full \add things\add*. 
\p
\v 26 Behold, the time shall come, that \add these\add* tokens which I have told thee shall come to pass, and the bride shall appear, and she coming forth shall be seen, that now is withdrawn from the earth. 
\v 27 And whosoever is delivered from the foresaid evils shall see my wonders. 
\v 28 For my son Jesus shall be revealed with those that be with him, and they that remain shall rejoice within four hundred years. 
\v 29 After these years shall my son Christ die, and all men that have life. 
\v 30 And the world shall be turned into the old silence seven days, like as in the former judgments: so that no man shall remain. 
\v 31 And after seven days the world, that yet awaketh not, shall be raised up, and that shall die that is corrupt. 
\v 32 And the earth shall restore \add those\add* that are asleep in her, and \add so\add* shall the dust \add those\add* that dwell in silence, and the secret places shall deliver \add those\add* souls that were committed unto them. 
\v 33 And the most High shall appear upon the seat of judgment, and misery shall pass away, and the long suffering shall have an end: 
\v 34 but judgment only shall remain, truth shall stand, and faith shall wax strong: 
\v 35 and the work shall follow, and the reward shall be shewed, and the good deeds shall be of force, and wicked deeds shall bear no rule. 
\p
\v 36 Then said I, Abraham prayed first for the Sodomites, and Moses for the fathers that sinned in the wilderness: 
\v 37 and Jesus after him for Israel in the time of Achan: 
\v 38 and Samuel \add and\add* David for the destruction: and Solomon for them that should come to the sanctuary: 
\v 39 and Helias for those that received rain; and for the dead, that he might live: 
\v 40 and Ezechias for the people in the time of Sennacherib: and many for many. 
\v 41 Even so now, seeing corruption is grown up, and wickedness increased, and the righteous have prayed for the ungodly; wherefore shall it not be so now also? 
\v 42 He answered me, and said, \add This\add* present life is not the end, where much glory doth abide; therefore have they prayed for the weak. 
\v 43 But the day of doom shall be the end of this time, and the beginning of the immortality for to come, wherein corruption is past, 
\v 44 intemperance is at an end, infidelity is cut off, righteousness is grown, \add and\add* truth is sprung up. 
\v 45 Then shall no man be able to save him that is destroyed, nor to oppress \add him\add* that hath gotten the victory. 
\v 46 I answered then and said, 
\p This is my first and last saying, that it had been better not to have given the earth unto Adam: or else, when it was given \add him\add*, to have restrained him from sinning. 
\v 47 For what profit is it for men \add now\add* in this present time to live in heaviness, and after death to look for punishment? 
\v 48 O thou Adam, what hast thou done? for though it was thou that sinned, thou art not fallen alone, but we \add all\add* that come of thee. 
\v 49 For what profit is it unto us, if there be promised us an immortal time, whereas we have done the works that bring death? 
\v 50 And that there is promised us an everlasting hope, whereas ourselves being most wicked are made vain? 
\v 51 And that there are laid up for us dwellings of health and safety, whereas we have lived wickedly? 
\v 52 And that the glory of the most High is kept to defend them which have led a wary life, whereas we have walked in the most wicked ways \add of all?\add* 
\v 53 And that there should be shewed a paradise, whose fruit endureth for ever, wherein is security and medicine, sith we shall not enter \add into it?\add* 
\v 54 (For we have walked in unpleasant places.) 
\v 55 And that the faces of them which have used abstinence shall shine above the stars, whereas our faces \add shall be\add* blacker than darkness? 
\v 56 For while we lived and committed iniquity, we considered not that we should begin to suffer \add for it\add* after death. 
\p
\v 57 Then answered he \add me\add*, and said, This is the condition of the battle, which man that is born upon the earth shall fight; 
\v 58 that, if he be overcome, he shall suffer as thou hast said: but if he get the victory, he shall receive \add the thing\add* that I say. 
\v 59 For this is the life whereof Moses spake unto the people while he lived, saying, Choose thee life, that thou mayest live. 
\v 60 Nevertheless they believed not him, nor yet the prophets after him, no nor me which have spoken unto them, 
\v 61 that there should not be \add such\add* heaviness in their destruction, as shall be joy over them that are persuaded to salvation. 
\v 62 I answered then, and said, I know, Lord, that the most High is called merciful, in that he hath mercy upon them which are not yet come into the world, 
\v 63 and upon those \add also\add* that turn to his law; 
\v 64 and \add that\add* he is patient, and long suffereth those that have sinned, as his creatures; 
\v 65 and \add that\add* he is bountiful, for he is ready to give where it needeth; 
\v 66 and \add that he is\add* of great mercy, for he multiplieth more \add and more\add* mercies to them that are present, and that are past, and \add also to them\add* which are to come. 
\v 67 For if he shall not multiply his mercies, the world would not continue with them that inherit therein. 
\v 68 And he pardoneth; for if he did not so of his goodness, that they which have committed iniquities might be eased of them, the ten thousand part of men should not remain living. 
\v 69 And being judge, if he should not forgive them that are cured with his word, and put out the multitude of contentions, 
\v 70 there should be very few left peradventure in an innumerable multitude. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1 And he answered me, saying, The most High hath made this world for many, but the world to come for few. 
\v 2 I will tell thee a similitude, Esdras; As when thou askest the earth, it shall say unto thee, that it giveth much mould whereof earthen vessels are made, but little dust that gold cometh of: even so \add is\add* the course of \add this\add* present world. 
\v 3 There be many created, but few shall be saved. 
\v 4 So answered I and said, 
\p Swallow then down, O \add my\add* soul, understanding, and devour wisdom. 
\v 5 For thou hast agreed to give ear, and \add art\add* willing to prophesy: for thou hast no longer space than only to live. 
\v 6 O Lord, if thou suffer not thy servant, that we may pray before thee, and thou give us seed unto our heart, and culture to \add our\add* understanding, that there may come fruit of it; how shall each \add man\add* live that is corrupt, who beareth the place of a man? 
\v 7 For thou art alone, and we \add all\add* one workmanship of thine hands, like as thou hast said. 
\v 8 For when the body is fashioned now in the \add mother’s\add* womb, and thou givest \add it\add* members, thy creature is preserved in fire and water, and nine months doth thy workmanship endure thy creature which is created in her. 
\v 9 But that which keepeth and is kept shall both be preserved: and when the time cometh, the womb preserved delivereth up \add the things\add* that grew in it. 
\v 10 For thou hast commanded out of the parts of the body, that is to say, \add out of\add* the breasts, milk to be given, which is the fruit of the breasts, 
\v 11 that the thing which is fashioned may be nourished for a time, till thou disposest it to thy mercy. 
\v 12 Thou broughtest it up with thy righteousness, and nurturedst it in thy law, and reformedst it with thy judgment. 
\v 13 And thou shalt mortify it as thy creature, and quicken it as thy work. 
\v 14 If therefore thou shalt destroy him which with so great labour was fashioned, it is an easy \add thing\add* to be ordained by thy commandment, that the thing which was made might be preserved. 
\v 15 Now therefore, Lord, I will speak; touching man in general, thou knowest best: but touching thy people, for whose sake I am sorry; 
\v 16 and for thine inheritance, for whose cause I mourn; and for Israel, for whom I am heavy; and for Jacob, for whose sake I am troubled; 
\v 17 therefore will I begin to pray before thee for myself and for them: for I see the falls of us that dwell in the land. 
\v 18 But I have heard the swiftness of the judge which is to come. 
\v 19 Therefore hear my voice, and understand my words, and I shall speak before thee. 
\p \add This is\add* the beginning of the words of Esdras, before he was taken up: and I said, 
\p
\v 20 O Lord, thou that dwellest in everlastingness, which beholdest from above \add things\add* in the heaven and in the air; 
\v 21 whose throne \add is\add* inestimable; whose glory may not be comprehended; before whom the hosts of angels stand with trembling, 
\v 22 (whose service is conversant in wind and fire,) whose word \add is\add* true, and sayings constant; whose commandment \add is\add* strong, and ordinance fearful; 
\v 23 whose look drieth up the depths, and indignation maketh the mountains to melt away; which the truth witnesseth: 
\v 24 O hear the prayer of thy servant, and give ear to the petition of thy creature. 
\v 25 For while I live I will speak, and so long as I have understanding I will answer. 
\v 26 O look not upon the sins of thy people; but \add on them\add* which serve thee in truth. 
\v 27 Regard not the wicked inventions of the heathen, but \add the desire of those\add* that keep thy testimonies in afflictions. 
\v 28 Think not \add upon those\add* that have walked feignedly before thee: but remember \add them\add*, which according to thy will have known \add thy\add* fear. 
\v 29 Let it not be thy will to destroy \add them\add* which have lived like beasts; but to look upon them that have clearly taught thy law. 
\v 30 Take thou no indignation at them which are deemed worse than beasts; but love them that always put their trust in thy righteousness and glory. 
\v 31 For we and our fathers do languish of such diseases: but because of us sinners thou shalt be called merciful. 
\v 32 For if thou hast a desire to have mercy upon us, thou shalt be called merciful, to us namely, that have no works of righteousness. 
\v 33 For the just, which have many \add good\add* works laid up \add with thee\add*, shall out of their own deeds receive reward. 
\v 34 For what is man, that thou shouldest take displeasure at him? or \add what is\add* a corruptible generation, that thou shouldest be so bitter toward it? 
\v 35 For in truth there is no man among them that be born, but he hath dealt wickedly; and among the faithful \add there is none\add* which hath not done amiss. 
\v 36 For in this, O Lord, thy righteousness and thy goodness shall be declared, if thou be merciful unto them which have not the confidence of good works. 
\p
\v 37 Then answered he me, and said, Some \add things\add* hast thou spoken aright, and according unto thy words it shall be. 
\v 38 For indeed I will not think on the disposition of them which have sinned before death, before judgment, before destruction: 
\v 39 but I will rejoice over the disposition of the righteous, and I will remember also \add their\add* pilgrimage, and the salvation, and the reward that they shall have. 
\v 40 Like as I have spoken now, so shall it come to pass. 
\v 41 For as the husbandman soweth much seed upon the ground, and planteth many trees, and yet \add the thing\add* that is sown \add good\add* in his season cometh not up, neither doth all that is planted take root: even so \add is it of them\add* that are sown in the world; they shall not all be saved. 
\v 42 I answered then and said, If I have found grace, let me speak. 
\v 43 Like as the husbandman’s seed \add perisheth\add*, if it come not up, and receive not thy rain in due season; or if there come too much rain, and corrupt it: 
\v 44 even so perisheth man also, which is formed with thy hands, and is called thine own image, because thou art like unto him, for whose sake thou hast made all \add things\add*, and likened \add him\add* unto the husbandman’s seed. 
\v 45 Be not wroth with us, but spare thy people, and have mercy upon thine own inheritance: for thou art merciful unto thy creature. 
\v 46 Then answered he me, and said, \add Things\add* present \add are\add* for the present, and \add things\add* to come for such as be to come. 
\v 47 For thou comest far short that thou shouldest be able to love my creature more than I: but I have ofttimes drawn nigh unto thee, and unto it, but never to the unrighteous. 
\v 48 In this also thou art marvellous before the most High: 
\v 49 in that thou hast humbled thyself, as it becometh thee, and hast not judged thyself \add worthy\add* to be much glorified among the righteous. 
\v 50 For many great miseries shall be done to them that in the latter \add time\add* shall dwell in the world, because they have walked in great pride. 
\v 51 But understand thou for thyself, and seek out the glory for such as be like thee. 
\v 52 For unto you is paradise opened, the tree of life is planted, the time to come is prepared, plenteousness is made ready, a city is builded, and rest is allowed, yea, perfect goodness and wisdom. 
\v 53 The root of evil is sealed up from you, weakness and the moth is hid from you, and corruption is fled into hell to be forgotten: 
\v 54 sorrows are passed, and in the end is shewed the treasure of immortality. 
\v 55  \add And\add* therefore ask thou no more questions concerning the multitude of them that perish. 
\v 56 For when they had taken liberty, they despised the most High, thought scorn of his law, and forsook his ways. 
\v 57 Moreover they have trodden down his righteous, 
\v 58 and said in their heart, that there is no God; yea, and that knowing they must die. 
\v 59 For as the \add things\add* aforesaid shall receive you, so thirst and pain are prepared for them: for it was not his will that men should come to nought: 
\v 60 but they which be created have defiled the name of him that made them, and were unthankful unto him which prepared life for them. 
\v 61 And therefore is my judgment now at hand. 
\v 62 These \add things\add* have I not shewed unto all \add men\add*, but unto thee, and a few like thee. Then answered I and said, 
\v 63 Behold, O Lord, now hast thou shewed me the multitude of the wonders, which thou wilt begin to do in the last \add times:\add* but at what time, thou hast not shewed me. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 He answered me then, and said, Measure thou the time diligently in itself: and when thou seest part of the signs past, which I have told \add thee\add* before, 
\v 2 then shalt thou understand, that it is the very \add same\add* time, wherein the Highest will begin to visit the world which he made. 
\v 3 Therefore when there shall be seen earthquakes and uproars of the people in the world: 
\v 4 then shalt thou \add well\add* understand, that the most High spake of those \add things\add* from the days that were before thee, \add even\add* from the beginning. 
\v 5 For like as all that is made in the world hath a beginning and an end, and the end is manifest: 
\v 6  \add even\add* so the times also of the Highest have plain beginnings in wonders and powerful works, and endings in effects and signs. 
\v 7 And every one that shall be saved, and shall be able to escape by his works, and by faith, whereby ye have believed, 
\v 8 shall be preserved from the said perils, and shall see my salvation in my land, and within my borders: for I have sanctified \add them for\add* me from the beginning. 
\v 9 Then shall they be in pitiful case, which now have abused my ways: and they that have cast them away despitefully shall dwell in torments. 
\v 10 For such as in their life have received benefits, and have not known me; 
\v 11 and \add they\add* that have lothed my law, while they had yet liberty, and, when as yet place of repentance was open unto them, understood not, but despised \add it;\add* 
\v 12 the same must know \add it\add* after death by pain. 
\v 13 And therefore be thou not curious how the ungodly shall be punished, and when: but inquire how the righteous shall be saved, whose the world \add is\add*, and for whom the world \add is created\add*. 
\p
\v 14 Then answered I and said, 
\v 15 I have said before, and now do speak, and will speak \add it also\add* hereafter, that there be \add many\add* moe \add of them\add* which perish, than \add of them\add* which shall be saved, 
\v 16 like as a wave is greater than a drop. 
\v 17 And he answered me, saying, Like as the field \add is\add*, so \add is\add* also the seed; as the flowers \add be\add*, such \add are\add* the colours also; such as the workman \add is\add*, such also \add is\add* the work; and as the husbandman \add is himself\add*, so \add is his\add* husbandry \add also:\add* for it was the time of the world. 
\v 18 And now when I prepared the world, which was not yet made, even for them to dwell in that now live, no man spake against me. 
\v 19 For then every one \add obeyed:\add* but now the manners of them which are created in this world that is made are corrupted by a perpetual seed, and by a law \add which is\add* unsearchable rid themselves. 
\v 20 So I considered the world, and behold, there was peril because of the devices that were come into it. 
\v 21 And I saw, and spared it greatly, and have kept me a grape of the cluster, and a plant of a great people. 
\v 22 Let the multitude perish then, which was born in vain; and let my grape be kept, and my plant; for with great labour have I made \add it\add* perfect. 
\v 23 Nevertheless, if thou wilt cease yet seven days moe, (but thou shalt not fast in them, 
\v 24  \add but\add* go into a field of flowers, where no house is builded, and eat only the flowers of the field; taste no flesh, drink no wine, but \add eat\add* flowers only;) 
\v 25  \add and\add* pray unto the Highest continually, then will I come and talk with thee. 
\p
\v 26 So I went my way into the field which is called Ardath, like as he commanded me; and there I sat amongst the flowers, and did eat of the herbs of the field, and the meat of the same satisfied me. 
\v 27 After seven days I sat upon the grass, and my heart was vexed \add within me\add*, like as before: 
\v 28 and I opened my mouth, and began to talk before the most High, and said, 
\p
\v 29 O Lord, thou that shewest thyself unto us, thou wast shewed unto our fathers in the wilderness, \add in a place\add* where no man treadeth, in a barren \add place\add*, when they came out of Egypt. 
\v 30 And thou spakest, saying, Hear me, O Israel; and mark my words, \add thou\add* seed of Jacob. 
\v 31 For behold, I sow my law in you, and it shall bring fruit in you, and ye shall be honoured in it for ever. 
\v 32 But our fathers, which received the law, kept \add it\add* not, and observed not thy ordinances: and though the fruit of \add thy\add* law did not perish, neither could it, for it was thine; 
\v 33 yet \add they\add* that received \add it\add* perished, because they kept not \add the thing\add* that was sown in them. 
\v 34 And lo, it is a custom, when the ground hath received seed, or the sea a ship, or any vessel meat or drink, that, that being perished wherein it was sown or cast into, 
\v 35 that \add thing\add* also which was sown, or cast therein, or received, doth perish, and remaineth not with us: but with us it hath not happened so. 
\v 36 For we that have received the law perish by sin, and our heart \add also\add* which received it. 
\v 37 Notwithstanding the law perisheth not, but remaineth in his force. 
\p
\v 38 And when I spake these \add things\add* in my heart, I looked back with mine eyes, and upon the right side I saw a woman, and behold, she mourned and wept with a loud voice, and was much grieved in heart, and her clothes \add were\add* rent, and \add she had\add* ashes upon her head. 
\v 39 Then let I my thoughts go that I was in, and turned me unto her, 
\v 40 and said unto her, Wherefore weepest thou? why art thou \add so\add* grieved in \add thy\add* mind? 
\v 41 And she said unto me, Sir, let me alone, that I may bewail myself, and add unto my sorrow, for I am sore vexed in my mind, and brought very low. 
\v 42 And I said unto her, What aileth thee? tell me. 
\v 43 She said unto me, I thy servant have been barren, and had no child, though I had a husband thirty years, 
\v 44 and those thirty years I did nothing else day and night, and every hour, but make my prayer to the Highest. 
\v 45 After thirty years God heard me thine handmaid, looked upon my misery, considered my trouble, and gave me a son: and I was very glad of him, \add so was\add* my husband also, and all my neighbours: and we gave great honour unto the Almighty. 
\v 46 And I nourished him with great travail. 
\v 47 So when he grew up, and came to the time that he should have a wife, I made a feast. 
\c 10  
\nb
\v 1 And it \add so\add* came to pass, \add that\add* when my son was entered into his wedding chamber, he fell down, and died. 
\v 2 Then we all overthrew the lights, and all my neighbours rose up to comfort me: so I took my rest unto the second day at night. 
\v 3 And it came to pass, when they had all left off to comfort me, to the end I might be quiet; then rose I up by night, and fled, and came \add hither\add* into this field, as thou seest. 
\v 4 And I do now purpose not to return into the city, but here to stay, and neither to eat nor drink, but continually to mourn and to fast until I die. 
\p
\v 5 Then left I the meditations wherein I was, and spake to her in anger, saying, 
\v 6  \add Thou\add* foolish woman above all other, seest thou not our mourning, and what happeneth unto us? 
\v 7 How that Sion our mother is full of all heaviness, and much humbled, mourning very sore? 
\v 8 And now, seeing we all mourn and are sad, for we are all in heaviness, art thou grieved for one son? 
\v 9 For ask the earth, and she shall tell thee, that it is she which ought to mourn for the fall of so many that grow upon her. 
\v 10 For out of her came all at the first, and \add out of her\add* shall \add all\add* others come, and behold, they walk almost all into destruction, and a multitude of them is utterly rooted out. 
\v 11 Who then should make more mourning than she, that hath lost so great a multitude; and not thou, which art sorry but for one? 
\v 12 But if thou sayest unto me, My lamentation is not like the earth’s, because I have lost the fruit of my womb, which I brought forth with pains, and bare with sorrows; 
\v 13 but the earth \add not so:\add* for the multitude present in it according to the course of the earth is gone, as it came: 
\v 14 then say I unto thee, Like as thou hast brought forth with labour; \add even\add* so the earth also hath given her fruit, \add namely\add*, man, ever sithence the beginning unto him that made her. 
\v 15 Now therefore keep thy sorrow to thyself, and bear with a good courage that which hath befallen thee. 
\v 16 For if thou shalt acknowledge the determination of God to be just, thou shalt both receive thy son in time, and shalt be commended amongst women. 
\v 17 Go thy way then into the city to thine husband. 
\v 18 And she said unto me, \add That\add* will I not do: I will not go into the city, but here will I die. 
\v 19 So I proceeded to speak further unto her, and said, 
\p
\v 20 Do not so, but be counselled by me: for how many \add are\add* the adversities of Sion? be comforted in regard of the sorrow of Jerusalem. 
\v 21 For thou seest that our sanctuary is laid waste, our altar broken down, our temple destroyed; 
\v 22 our psaltery is laid on the ground, \add our\add* song is put to silence, our rejoicing is at an end, the light of our candlestick is put out, the ark of our covenant is spoiled, our holy \add things\add* are defiled, and the name that is called upon us is almost profaned: our children are put to shame, our priests are burnt, our Levites are gone into captivity, our virgins are defiled, and our wives ravished; our righteous \add men\add* carried away, our little ones destroyed, our young men are brought in bondage, and our strong \add men\add* are become weak; 
\v 23 and, which \add is\add* the greatest of all, the seal of Sion hath now lost her honour; for she is delivered into the hands of them that hate us. 
\v 24 And therefore shake off thy great heaviness, and put away the multitude of sorrows, that the Mighty may be merciful unto thee again, and the Highest shall give thee rest \add and\add* ease from thy labour. 
\p
\v 25 And it came to pass, while I was talking with her, \add behold\add*, her face upon a sudden shined exceedingly, and her countenance glistered, so that I was afraid of her, and mused what it might be. 
\v 26 And behold, suddenly she made a great cry very fearful: so that the earth shook at the noise of the woman. 
\v 27 And I looked, and behold, the woman appeared unto me no more, but there was a city builded, and a large place shewed itself from the foundations: then was I afraid, and cried with a loud voice, and said, 
\v 28 Where is Uriel the angel, who came unto me at the first? for he hath caused me to fall into many trances, and mine end is turned into corruption, and my prayer to rebuke. 
\v 29 And as I was speaking these \add words\add*, behold, he came unto me, and looked upon me. 
\v 30 And lo, I lay as one that had been dead, and mine understanding was taken \add from me:\add* and he took me by the right hand, and comforted me, and set me upon my feet, and said unto me, 
\v 31 What aileth thee? and why art thou \add so\add* disquieted? and why is thine understanding troubled, and the thoughts of thine heart? 
\v 32 And I said, Because thou hast forsaken me, and yet I did according to thy words, and I went into the field, and lo, I have seen, and \add yet\add* see, that I am not able to express. 
\v 33 And he said unto me, Stand \add up\add* manfully, and I will advise thee. 
\v 34 Then said I, Speak \add on\add*, my lord, in me; \add only\add* forsake me not, lest I die frustrate \add of my hope\add*. 
\v 35 For I have seen that I knew not, and hear that I do not know. 
\v 36 Or is my sense deceived, or my soul in a dream? 
\v 37 Now therefore I beseech thee that thou wilt shew thy servant of this vision. 
\v 38 He answered me then, and said, 
\p Hear me, and I shall inform thee, and tell thee wherefore thou art afraid: for the Highest will reveal many secret things unto thee. 
\v 39 He hath seen that thy way \add is\add* right: for that thou sorrowest continually for thy people, and makest great lamentation for Sion. 
\v 40 This therefore \add is\add* the meaning of the vision which thou lately sawest: 
\v 41 thou sawest a woman mourning, and thou beganst to comfort her: 
\v 42 but now seest thou the likeness of the woman no more, but there appeared unto thee a city builded. 
\v 43 And whereas she told thee of the death of her son, this is the solution: 
\v 44 this woman, whom thou sawest, is Sion: and whereas she said unto thee, (even she whom thou seest as a city builded,) 
\v 45 whereas, \add I say\add*, she said unto thee, that she hath been thirty years barren: those are the thirty years wherein there was no offering made in her. 
\v 46 But after thirty years Solomon builded the city, and offered offerings: and then bare the barren a son. 
\v 47 And whereas she told thee that she nourished him with labour: that was the dwelling in Jerusalem. 
\v 48 But whereas she said unto thee, That my son coming into his marriage chamber happened to have a fall, and died: this was the destruction that came to Jerusalem. 
\v 49 And behold, thou sawest her likeness, and because she mourned for her son, thou beganst to comfort her: and of these \add things\add* which have chanced, these are to be opened unto thee. 
\v 50 For now the most High seeth that thou art grieved unfeignedly, and sufferest from \add thy\add* whole heart for her, so hath he shewed thee the brightness of her glory, and the comeliness of her beauty: 
\v 51 and therefore I bade thee remain in the field where no house was builded: 
\v 52 for I knew that the Highest would shew this unto thee. 
\v 53 Therefore I commanded thee to go into the field, where no foundation of \add any\add* building was. 
\v 54 For in the place wherein the Highest beginneth to shew his city, there can no man’s building be able to stand. 
\v 55  \add And\add* therefore fear not, let not thy heart be affrighted, but go \add thy way\add* in, and see the beauty and greatness of the building, as much as thine eyes be able to see: 
\v 56 and then shalt thou hear as much as thine ears may comprehend. 
\v 57 For thou art blessed above many \add other\add*, and art called with the Highest; and so \add are but\add* few. 
\v 58 But to morrow at night thou shalt remain here; 
\v 59 and \add so\add* shall the Highest shew thee visions of the high \add things\add*, which the most High will do unto them that dwell upon earth in the last days. So I slept that night and another, like as he commanded me. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 Then saw I a dream, and behold, there came up from the sea an eagle, which had twelve feathered wings, and three heads. 
\v 2 And I saw, and behold, she spread her wings over all the earth, and all the winds of the air blew on her, and were gathered together. 
\v 3 And I beheld, and out of her feathers there grew \add other\add* contrary feathers; and they became little feathers and small. 
\v 4 But her heads were at rest: the head in the midst was greater than the other, yet rested it with the residue. 
\v 5 Moreover I beheld, and lo, the eagle flew with her feathers, and reigned upon earth, and over them that dwelt therein. 
\v 6 And I saw that all \add things\add* under heaven were subject unto her, and no man spake against her, no, not one creature upon earth. 
\v 7 And I beheld, and lo, the eagle rose upon her talons, and spake to her feathers, saying, 
\v 8 Watch not all at once: sleep every one in his own place, and watch by course: 
\v 9 but let the heads be preserved for the last. 
\v 10 And I beheld, and lo, the voice went not out of her heads, but from the midst of her body. 
\v 11 And I numbered her contrary feathers, and behold, there were eight of them. 
\v 12 And I looked, and behold, on the right side there arose one feather, and reigned over all the earth; 
\v 13 and so it was, \add that\add* when it reigned, the end of it came, and the place thereof appeared no more: so the \add next\add* following stood up, and reigned, and had a great time; 
\v 14 and it happened, that when it reigned, the end of it came \add also\add*, like as the first, so that it appeared no more. 
\v 15 Then came there a voice unto it, and said, 
\v 16 Hear thou that hast borne rule over the earth so long: this I say unto thee, before thou beginnest to appear no more, 
\v 17 There shall none after thee attain unto thy time, neither unto the half thereof. 
\v 18 Then arose the third, and reigned as the other before, and appeared no more also. 
\v 19 So went it with all the residue one after another, as that \add every one\add* reigned, and then appeared no more. 
\v 20 Then I beheld, and lo, in process of time the feathers that followed stood up upon the right side, that they might rule also; and \add some\add* of them ruled, but within a while they appeared no more: 
\v 21 for some of them were set up, but ruled not. 
\v 22 After this I looked, and behold, the twelve feathers appeared no more, nor \add the\add* two little feathers: 
\v 23 and there was no more upon the eagle’s body, but three heads that rested, and six little wings. 
\v 24 Then saw I also that two little feathers divided themselves from the six, and remained under the head that was upon the right side: for the four continued in their place. 
\v 25 And I beheld, and lo, \add the feathers that were\add* under the wing thought to set up themselves, and to have the rule. 
\v 26 And I beheld, and lo, there was one set up, but shortly it appeared no more. 
\v 27 And the second was sooner away than the first. 
\v 28 And I beheld, and lo, the two that remained thought also in themselves to reign: 
\v 29 and when they so thought, behold, there awaked one of the heads that were at rest, \add namely, it\add* that was in the midst; for that was greater than the two \add other\add* heads. 
\v 30 And \add then\add* I saw that the two \add other\add* heads were joined with it. 
\v 31 And behold, the head was turned with them that were with it, and did eat up the two \add feathers\add* under the wing that would have reigned. 
\v 32 But this head put the whole earth in fear, and bare rule in it over \add all\add* those that dwelt upon the earth, with much oppression; and it had the governance of the world more than all the wings that had been. 
\v 33 And after this I beheld, and lo, the head \add that was\add* in the midst suddenly appeared no more, like as the wings. 
\v 34 But there remained the two heads, which also in like sort ruled upon the earth, and over those that dwelt therein. 
\v 35 And I beheld, and lo, the head upon the right side devoured it that \add was\add* upon the left \add side\add*. 
\p
\v 36 Then I heard a voice, which said unto me, Look before thee, and consider \add the thing\add* that thou seest. 
\v 37 And I beheld, and lo, as it were a roaring lion chased out of the wood: and I saw that he sent out a man’s voice unto the eagle, and said, 
\v 38 Hear thou, I will talk with thee, and the Highest shall say unto thee, 
\v 39 Art not thou \add it\add* that remainest of the four beasts, whom I made to reign in my world, that the end of their times might come through them? 
\v 40 And the fourth came, and overcame all the beasts that were past, and had power over the world with great fearfulness, and over the whole compass of the earth with much wicked oppression; and so long time dwelt he upon the earth with deceit. 
\v 41 For the earth hast thou not judged with truth. 
\v 42 For thou hast afflicted the meek, thou hast hurt the peaceable, thou hast loved liars, and destroyed the dwellings of them that brought forth fruit, and hast cast down the walls of such as did thee no harm. 
\v 43 Therefore is thy wrongful dealing come up unto the Highest, and thy pride unto the Mighty. 
\v 44 The Highest also hath looked upon the proud times, and behold, they are ended, and his abominations are fulfilled. 
\v 45  \add And\add* therefore appear no more, thou eagle, nor thy horrible wings, nor thy wicked feathers, nor thy malicious heads, nor thy hurtful claws, nor all thy vain body: 
\v 46 that all the earth may be refreshed, and may return, being delivered from thy violence, and \add that\add* she may hope for the judgment and mercy of him that made her. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass, whiles the lion spake these words unto the eagle, I saw, 
\v 2 and behold, the head that remained, and the four wings appeared no more, and the two went unto it, and set themselves up to reign, and their kingdom was small, and full of uproar. 
\v 3 And I saw, and behold, they appeared no more, and the whole body of the eagle was burnt, so that the earth was in great fear: then awaked I out of the trouble and trance of \add my\add* mind, and from great fear, and said unto my spirit, 
\v 4 Lo, this hast thou done unto me, in that thou searchest out the ways of the Highest. 
\v 5 Lo, yet am I weary in \add my\add* mind, and very weak in my spirit; and little strength is there in me, for the great fear wherewith I was affrighted this night. 
\v 6 Therefore will I now beseech the Highest, that he will comfort me unto the end. 
\v 7 And I said, Lord that bearest rule, if I have found grace before thy sight, and if I am justified with thee before many \add others\add*, and if my prayer indeed be come up before thy face; 
\v 8 comfort me \add then\add*, and shew me thy servant the interpretation and plain difference of this fearful vision, that thou mayest perfectly comfort my soul. 
\v 9 For thou hast judged me worthy to shew me the last times. 
\v 10 And he said unto me, 
\p This is the interpretation of the vision: 
\v 11 The eagle, whom thou sawest come up from the sea, is the kingdom which was seen in the vision of thy brother Daniel. 
\v 12 But it was not expounded unto him, therefore now I declare \add it\add* unto thee. 
\v 13 Behold, the days will come, that there shall rise up a kingdom upon earth, and it shall be feared above all the kingdoms that were before it. 
\v 14 In the same shall twelve kings reign, one after another: 
\v 15 whereof the second shall begin to reign, and shall have more time than \add any of\add* the twelve. 
\v 16  \add And\add* this do the twelve wings signify, which thou sawest. 
\v 17 As for the voice which thou heardest speak, \add and that thou sawest\add* not to go out from the heads, but from the midst of the body thereof, this is the interpretation: 
\v 18 That after the time of that kingdom there shall arise great strivings, and it shall stand in peril of falling: nevertheless it shall not then fall, but shall be restored again to his beginning. 
\v 19 And whereas thou sawest the eight \add small\add* under feathers sticking to her wings, this is the interpretation: 
\v 20  \add That\add* in him there shall arise eight kings, whose times shall be \add but\add* small, and \add their\add* years swift. 
\v 21 And two of them shall perish, the middle time approaching: four shall be kept until their end begin to approach: but two shall be kept unto the end. 
\v 22 And whereas thou sawest three heads resting, this is the interpretation: 
\v 23 In his last \add days\add* shall the most High raise up three kingdoms, and renew many \add things\add* therein, and they shall have the dominion of the earth, 
\v 24 and \add of those\add* that dwell therein, with much oppression, above all \add those\add* that were before them: therefore are they called the heads of the eagle. 
\v 25 For these are they that shall accomplish his wickedness, and that shall finish his last \add end\add*. 
\v 26 And whereas thou sawest that the great head appeared no more, it signifieth that one of them shall die upon his bed, and yet with pain. 
\v 27 For the two that remain shall be slain with the sword. 
\v 28 For the sword of the one shall devour the other: but at the last shall he fall through the sword himself. 
\v 29 And whereas thou sawest two \add feathers\add* under the wings passing over the head that is on the right side; 
\v 30 it signifieth that these are they, whom the Highest hath kept unto their end: this is the small kingdom and full of trouble, as thou sawest. 
\v 31 And the lion, whom thou sawest rising up out of the wood, and roaring, and speaking to the eagle, and rebuking her for her unrighteousness with all the words which thou hast heard; 
\v 32 this is the anointed, which the Highest hath kept \add for\add* them and for their wickedness unto the end: he shall reprove them, and shall upbraid them with their cruelty. 
\v 33 For he shall set them \add before him\add* alive in judgment, and shall rebuke them, and correct them. 
\v 34 For the rest of my people shall he deliver with mercy, \add those\add* that have been preserved upon my borders, and he shall make them joyful until the coming of the day of judgment, whereof I have spoken unto thee from the beginning. 
\v 35 This \add is\add* the dream that thou sawest, and these \add are\add* the interpretations. 
\v 36 Thou only hast been meet to know this secret of the Highest. 
\v 37 Therefore write all these \add things\add* that thou hast seen in a book, and hide them: 
\v 38 and teach them to the wise of the people, whose hearts thou knowest may comprehend and keep these secrets. 
\v 39 But wait thou here thyself yet seven days moe, that it may be shewed thee, whatsoever it pleaseth the Highest to declare unto thee. And \add with that\add* he went his way. 
\p
\v 40 And it came to pass, when all the people saw that the seven days were past, and I not come again into the city, they gathered them all together, from the least unto the greatest, and came unto me, and said, 
\v 41 What have we offended thee? and what evil have we done against thee, that thou forsakest us, and sittest \add here\add* in this place? 
\v 42 For of all the prophets thou only art left us, as a cluster of the vintage, and as a candle in a dark place, and as a haven or ship preserved from the tempest. 
\v 43 Are not the evils which are come to us sufficient? 
\v 44 If thou shalt forsake us, how much better had it been for us, if we also had been burnt in the midst of Sion? 
\v 45 For we are not better than they that died there. And they wept with a loud voice. Then answered I them, and said, 
\v 46 Be of good comfort, O Israel; and be not heavy, thou house of Jacob: 
\v 47 for the Highest hath you in remembrance, and the Mighty hath not forgotten you in temptation. 
\v 48 As for me, I have not forsaken you, neither am I departed from you: but am come into this place, to pray for the desolation of Sion, \add and\add* that I might seek mercy for the low estate of your sanctuary. 
\v 49 And now go \add your way\add* home every man, and after these days will I come unto you. 
\v 50 So the people went their way into the city, like as I commanded them: 
\v 51 but I remained still in the field seven days, as \add the angel\add* commanded me; and did eat only in those days of the flowers of the field, \add and\add* had my meat of the herbs. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass after seven days, I dreamed a dream by night: 
\v 2 and lo, there arose a wind from the sea, that it moved all the waves thereof. 
\v 3 And I beheld, and lo, that man waxed strong with the thousands of heaven: and when he turned his countenance to look, all \add the things\add* trembled that were seen under him. 
\v 4 And whensoever the voice went out of his mouth, all they burnt that heard his voice, like as the earth faileth when it feeleth the fire. 
\v 5 And after this I beheld, and lo, there was gathered together a multitude of men, out of number, from the four winds of the heaven, to subdue the man that came out of the sea. 
\v 6 But I beheld, and lo, he had graved himself a great mountain, and flew up upon it. 
\v 7 But I would have seen the region or place whereout the hill was graven, and I could not. 
\v 8 And after this I beheld, and lo, all they which were gathered together to subdue him were sore afraid, \add and\add* yet durst fight. 
\v 9 And lo, as he saw the violence of the multitude that came, he neither lift up his hand, nor held sword, nor any instrument of war: 
\v 10 but only I saw that he sent out of his mouth as it had been a blast of fire, and out of his lips a flaming breath, and out of his tongue he cast out sparks and tempests. 
\v 11 And they were all mixt together; the blast of fire, the flaming breath, and the great tempest; and fell with violence upon the multitude which was prepared to fight, and burnt them up every one, so that upon a sudden of an innumerable multitude nothing was to be perceived, but only dust and smell of smoke: when I saw \add this\add* I was afraid. 
\v 12 Afterward saw I the same man come down from the mountain, and call unto him another peaceable multitude. 
\v 13 And there came much people unto him, whereof some were glad, some were sorry, some \add of them\add* were bound, \add and\add* other some brought of them that were offered: then was I sick through great fear, and I awaked, and said, 
\v 14 Thou hast shewed thy servant these wonders from the beginning, and hast counted me worthy that thou shouldest receive my prayer: 
\v 15 shew me now yet the interpretation of this dream. 
\v 16 For as I conceive in mine understanding, woe \add unto them\add* that shall be left in those days! and much more woe \add unto them\add* that are not left behind! 
\v 17 For \add they\add* that were not left were in heaviness. 
\v 18 Now understand I \add the things\add* that are laid up in the latter days, which shall happen unto them, and to those that are left behind. 
\v 19 Therefore are they come into great perils and many necessities, like as these dreams declare. 
\v 20 Yet is it easier for him that is in danger to come into these \add things\add*, than to pass away as a cloud out of the world, and not to see \add the things\add* that happen in the last days. And he answered unto me, and said, 
\p
\v 21 The interpretation of the vision shall I shew thee, and I will open unto thee \add the thing\add* that thou hast required. 
\v 22 Whereas thou hast spoken of them that are left behind, this is the interpretation: 
\v 23 He that shall endure the peril in that time hath kept himself: they that be fallen into danger are such as have works, and faith towards the Almighty. 
\v 24 Know \add this\add* therefore, that \add they\add* which \add be\add* left behind are more blessed than they that be dead. 
\v 25 This \add is\add* the meaning of the vision: Whereas thou sawest a man coming up from the midst of the sea: 
\v 26 the same is he whom \add God\add* the Highest hath kept a great season, which by his own self shall deliver his creature: and he shall order \add them\add* that are left behind. 
\v 27 And whereas thou sawest, that out of his mouth there came as a blast \add of wind\add*, and fire, and storm; 
\v 28 and that he held neither sword, nor \add any\add* instrument of war, but that the rushing in of him destroyed the \add whole\add* multitude that came to subdue him; this is the interpretation: 
\v 29 Behold, the days come, when the most High will begin to deliver them that are upon the earth. 
\v 30 And he shall come to the astonishment of them that dwell on the earth. 
\v 31 And one shall undertake to fight against another, one city against another, one place against another, one people against another, and one realm against another. 
\v 32 And \add the time\add* shall be when these \add things\add* shall come to pass, and the signs shall happen which I shewed thee before, and then shall my Son be declared, whom thou sawest as a man ascending. 
\v 33 And when all the people hear his voice, every man shall in their own land leave the battle they have one against another. 
\v 34 And an innumerable multitude shall be gathered together, as \add thou sawest them\add*, willing to come, and to overcome him by fighting. 
\v 35 But he shall stand upon the top of the mount Sion. 
\v 36 And Sion shall come, and shall be shewed to all \add men\add*, being prepared and builded, like as thou sawest the hill graven without hands. 
\v 37 And this my Son shall rebuke the wicked inventions of those nations, which for their wicked life are fallen into the tempest; 
\v 38  \add and shall lay before them\add* their evil thoughts, and the torments wherewith they shall begin to be tormented, which are like unto a flame: and he shall destroy them without labour by the law which is like unto fire. 
\v 39 And whereas thou sawest that he gathered another peaceable multitude unto him; 
\v 40 those are the ten tribes, which were carried away prisoners out of their own land in the time of Osea the king, whom Salmanasar the king of Assyria led \add away\add* captive, and he carried them over the waters, and \add so\add* came they into another land. 
\v 41 But they took this counsel amongst themselves, that they would leave the multitude of the heathen, and go forth into a further country, where never mankind dwelt, 
\v 42 that \add they\add* might there keep their statutes, which they never kept in their own land. 
\v 43 And they entered into Euphrates by the narrow passages of the river. 
\v 44 For the most High then shewed signs for them, and held still the flood, till they were passed over. 
\v 45 For through that country there was a great way to go, \add namely\add*, of a year and a half: and the same region is called Arsareth. 
\v 46 Then dwelt they there until the latter time; and now when they shall begin to come, 
\v 47 the Highest shall stay the springs of the stream again, that they may go through: therefore sawest thou the multitude with peace. 
\v 48 But \add those\add* that be left behind of thy people are they that are found within my borders. 
\v 49 Now when he destroyeth the multitude of the nations that are gathered together, he shall defend his people that remain. 
\v 50 And then shall he shew them great wonders. 
\p
\v 51 Then said I, O Lord that bearest rule, shew me this: Wherefore have I seen the man coming up from the midst of the sea? 
\v 52 And he said unto me, Like as thou canst neither seek out nor know \add the things\add* that are in the deep of the sea: \add even\add* so can no man upon earth see my Son, or those that be with him, but in the daytime. 
\v 53 This is the interpretation of the dream which thou sawest, and whereby thou only art here lightened. 
\v 54 For thou hast forsaken thine own \add way\add*, and applied thy diligence unto my law, and sought \add it\add*. 
\v 55 Thy life hast thou ordered in wisdom, and hast called understanding thy mother. 
\v 56 And therefore have I shewed thee the treasures of the Highest: after other three days I will speak other \add things\add* unto thee, and declare unto thee mighty and wondrous \add things\add*. 
\v 57 Then went I forth into the field, giving praise and thanks greatly unto the most High because of \add his\add* wonders, which he did in time; 
\v 58 and because he governeth the same, and such \add things\add* as fall in \add their\add* seasons: and there I sat three days. 
\c 14  
\nb
\v 1 And it came to pass upon the third day, I sat under an oak, and behold, there came a voice out of a bush over against me, and said, Esdras, Esdras. 
\v 2 And I said, Here \add am\add* I, Lord. And I stood up upon my feet. 
\v 3 Then said he unto me, In the bush I did manifestly reveal myself unto Moses, and talked with him, when my people served in Egypt: 
\v 4 and I sent him, and led my people out of Egypt, and brought him up to the mount of Sinai, where I held him by me a long season, 
\v 5 and told him many wondrous \add things\add*, and shewed him the secrets of the times, and the end; and commanded him, saying, 
\v 6 These words shalt thou declare, and these shalt thou hide. 
\v 7 And now I say unto thee, 
\v 8  \add That\add* thou lay up in thy heart the signs that I have shewed, and the dreams that thou hast seen, and the interpretations which thou hast heard: 
\v 9 for thou shalt be taken away from all, \add and\add* from henceforth thou shalt remain with my Son, and with such as be like thee, until the times be ended. 
\v 10 For the world hath lost his youth, and the times begin to wax old. 
\v 11 For the world is divided into twelve parts, and the ten \add parts\add* of it are gone \add already\add*, and half of a tenth part: 
\v 12 and there remaineth \add that which is\add* after the half of the tenth part. 
\v 13 Now therefore set thine house in order, and reprove thy people, comfort such of them as be in trouble, and now renounce corruption, 
\v 14 let go from thee mortal thoughts, cast away the burdens of man, put off now the weak nature, 
\v 15 and set aside the thoughts \add that are\add* most heavy unto thee, and haste thee to flee from these times. 
\v 16 For yet greater evils than those which thou hast seen happen shall be done \add hereafter\add*. 
\v 17 For \add look\add* how much the world shall be weak\add er\add* through age, so much \add the more\add* shall evils increase upon them that dwell therein. 
\v 18 For the truth is fled far away, and leasing is hard at hand: for now hasteth the vision to come, which thou hast seen. 
\v 19 Then answered I before thee, and said, 
\v 20 Behold, Lord, I will go, as thou hast commanded me, and reprove the people which are present: but \add they\add* that shall be born afterward, who shall admonish \add them?\add* thus the world is set in darkness, and \add they\add* that dwell therein \add are\add* without light. 
\v 21 For thy law is burnt, therefore no man knoweth \add the things\add* that are done of thee, or the works that shall begin. 
\v 22 But if I have found grace before thee, send the Holy Ghost into me, and I shall write all that hath been done in the world since the beginning, which were written in thy law, that men may find \add thy\add* path, and \add that they\add* which will live in the latter \add days\add* may live. 
\v 23 And he answered me, saying, Go \add thy way\add*, gather the people together, and say unto them, that they seek thee not for forty days. 
\v 24 But look thou prepare thee many box trees, and take with thee Sarea, Dabria, Selemia, Ecanus, and Asiel, these five which are ready to write swiftly; 
\v 25 and come hither, and I shall light a candle of understanding in thine heart, which shall not be put out, till \add the things\add* be performed which thou shalt begin to write. 
\v 26 And when thou hast done, some \add things\add* shalt thou publish, \add and\add* some \add things\add* shalt thou shew secretly to the wise: to morrow this hour shalt thou begin to write. 
\v 27 Then went I forth, as he commanded, and gathered all the people together, and said, 
\p
\v 28 Hear these words, O Israel. 
\v 29 Our fathers at the beginning were strangers in Egypt, from whence they were delivered: 
\v 30 and received the law of life, which they kept not, which ye also have transgressed after them. 
\v 31 Then was the land, even the land of Sion, parted among you by lot: but your fathers, and ye \add yourselves\add*, have done unrighteousness, and have not kept the ways which the Highest commanded you. 
\v 32 And forasmuch as he is a righteous judge, he took from you in time \add the thing\add* that he had given \add you\add*. 
\v 33 And now are you here, and your brethren among you. 
\v 34 Therefore if so be that you will subdue your own understanding, and reform your hearts, ye shall be kept alive, and after death ye shall obtain mercy. 
\v 35 For after death shall the judgment come, when we shall live again: and then shall the names of the righteous be manifest, and the works of the ungodly shall be declared. 
\v 36 Let no man therefore come unto me now, nor seek after me these forty days. 
\v 37 So I took the five men, as he commanded me, and we went into the field, and remained there. 
\v 38 And the next day, behold, a voice called me, saying, Esdras, open thy mouth, and drink that I give thee to drink. 
\v 39 Then opened I my mouth, and behold, \add he\add* reached me a full cup, which was full as it were with water, but the colour of it \add was\add* like fire. 
\v 40 And I took \add it\add*, and drank: and when I had drunk \add of it\add*, my heart uttered understanding, and wisdom grew in my breast, for my spirit strengthened \add my\add* memory: 
\v 41 and my mouth was opened, and shut no more. 
\v 42 The Highest gave understanding unto the five men, and they wrote the wonderful visions of the night that were told, which they knew not: \add and they sat forty days, and they wrote in the day\add*, and at night they ate bread. 
\v 43 As for me, I spake in the day, and held not my tongue by night. 
\v 44 In forty days \add they\add* wrote two hundred and four books. 
\v 45 And it came to pass, when the forty days were fulfilled, \add that\add* the Highest spake, saying, The first that thou hast written publish openly, that the worthy and unworthy may read \add it:\add* 
\v 46 but keep the seventy last, that thou mayest deliver them \add only\add* to such as be wise among the people: 
\v 47 for in them is the spring of understanding, the fountains of wisdom, and the stream of knowledge. 
\v 48 And I did so. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1 Behold, speak thou in the ears of my people the words of prophecy, which I will put in thy mouth, saith the Lord: 
\v 2 and cause them to be written in paper: for they are faithful and true. 
\v 3 Fear not the imaginations against thee, let not the incredulity of them trouble thee, that speak \add against thee\add*. 
\v 4 For all the unfaithful shall die in their unfaithfulness. 
\v 5 Behold, saith the Lord, I will bring plagues upon the world; the sword, famine, death, and destruction. 
\v 6 For wickedness hath exceedingly polluted the whole earth, and their hurtful works are fulfilled. 
\v 7 Therefore saith the Lord, 
\v 8 I will hold my tongue no more as touching their wickedness, which they profanely commit, neither will I suffer \add them\add* in those \add things\add*, in which they wickedly exercise themselves: behold, the innocent and righteous blood crieth unto me, and the souls of the just complain continually. 
\v 9  \add And therefore\add*, saith the Lord, I will surely avenge them, and receive unto me all the innocent blood from among them. 
\v 10 Behold, my people is led as a flock to the slaughter: I will not suffer them now to dwell in the land of Egypt: 
\v 11 but I will bring them with a mighty hand and a stretched out arm, and smite \add Egypt\add* with plagues, as before, and will destroy all the land thereof. 
\v 12 Egypt shall mourn, and the foundation of it \add shall be\add* smitten with the plague and punishment that God shall bring upon it. 
\v 13 They that till the ground shall mourn: for their seeds shall fail through the blasting and hail, and with a fearful constellation. 
\v 14 Woe to the world and \add them\add* that dwell therein! 
\v 15 For the sword and their destruction draweth nigh, and one people shall stand up to fight against another, and swords in their hands. 
\v 16 For there shall be sedition among men, and invading one another; they shall not regard their kings nor princes, \add and\add* the course of their actions \add shall stand\add* in their power. 
\v 17 A man shall desire to go into a city, and shall not be able. 
\v 18 For because of their pride the cities shall be troubled, the houses shall be destroyed, and men shall be afraid. 
\v 19 A man shall have no pity upon his neighbour, but shall destroy their houses with the sword, and spoil their goods, because of the lack of bread, and \add for\add* great tribulation. 
\v 20 Behold, saith God, I will call together all the kings of the earth to reverence me, which are from the rising \add of the sun\add*, from the south, from the east, and Libanus; to turn themselves one against another, and repay \add the things\add* that they have done to them. 
\v 21 Like as they do yet this day unto my chosen, so will I do \add also\add*, and recompense in their bosom. Thus saith the Lord God; 
\v 22 My right hand shall not spare the sinners, and \add my\add* sword shall not cease over them that shed innocent blood upon earth. 
\v 23 The fire is gone forth from his wrath, and hath consumed the foundations of the earth, and the sinners, like the straw that is kindled. 
\v 24 Woe to them that sin, and keep not my commandments! saith the Lord. 
\v 25 I will not spare them: go your way, \add ye\add* children, from the power, defile not my sanctuary. 
\v 26 For the Lord knoweth all them that sin against him, \add and\add* therefore delivereth he them unto death and destruction. 
\v 27 For now are the plagues come upon the whole earth, and ye shall remain in them: for God shall not deliver you, because ye have sinned against him. 
\p
\v 28 Behold a horrible vision, and the appearance thereof from the east: 
\v 29 where the nations of the dragons of Arabia shall come out with many chariots, and the multitude of them shall be carried as the wind upon earth, that all \add they\add* which hear them may fear and tremble. 
\v 30 Also the Carmanians raging in wrath shall go forth as the wild boars of the wood, and with great power shall they come, and join battle with them, and shall waste a portion of the land of the Assyrians. 
\v 31 And then shall the dragons have the upper hand, remembering their nature; and \add if\add* they shall turn themselves, conspiring together in great power to persecute them, 
\v 32  \add then\add* these shall be troubled, and keep silence through their power, and shall flee. 
\v 33 And from the land of the Assyrians shall the enemy besiege them, and consume some of them, and in their host shall be fear and dread, and strife among their kings. 
\v 34 Behold clouds from the east and \add from\add* the north unto the south, and they are very horrible to look upon, full of wrath and storm. 
\v 35 They shall smite one upon another, and they shall smite down a great multitude of stars upon the earth, even their own star; and blood shall be from the sword unto the belly, 
\v 36 and dung of men unto the camel’s hough. 
\v 37 And there shall be great fearfulness and trembling upon earth: and \add they\add* that see the wrath shall be afraid, and trembling shall come upon them. 
\v 38 And then shall there come great storms from the south, and \add from\add* the north, and another part from the west. 
\v 39 And strong winds shall arise from the east, and shall open it; and the cloud which he raised up in wrath, and the star stirred to cause fear toward the east and west wind, shall be destroyed. 
\v 40 The great and mighty clouds shall be lifted up full of wrath, and the star, that they may make all the earth afraid, and them that dwell therein; and they shall pour out over every high and eminent place a horrible star, 
\v 41 fire, and hail, and flying swords, and many waters, that all fields may be full, and all rivers, with the abundance of great waters. 
\v 42 And they shall break down the cities and walls, mountains and hills, trees of the wood, and grass of the meadows, and their corn. 
\v 43 And they shall go stedfastly unto Babylon, and make her afraid. 
\v 44 They shall come to her, and besiege her, the star and all wrath shall they pour out upon her: then shall the dust and smoke go up unto the heaven, and all \add they that be\add* about her shall bewail her. 
\v 45 And \add they\add* that remain under her shall do service unto them that have put \add her\add* in fear. 
\p
\v 46 And thou, Asia, \add that art\add* partaker of the hope of Babylon, and \add art\add* the glory of her person: 
\v 47 woe be unto thee, \add thou\add* wretch, because thou hast made \add thyself\add* like unto her; and hast deckt thy daughters in whoredom, that \add they\add* might please and glory in thy lovers, which have alway desired to commit whoredom with thee! 
\v 48 Thou hast followed \add her that is\add* hated in all her works and inventions: therefore saith God, 
\v 49 I will send plagues upon thee; widowhood, poverty, famine, sword, and pestilence, to waste thy houses with destruction and death. 
\v 50 And the glory of thy power shall be dried up as a flower, when the heat shall arise that is sent over thee. 
\v 51 Thou shalt be weakened as a poor woman with stripes, and \add as one\add* chastised with wounds, so that the mighty and lovers shall not be able to receive thee. 
\v 52 Would I with jealousy have so proceeded against thee, saith the Lord, 
\v 53 if thou hadst not alway slain my chosen, exalting the stroke of \add thine\add* hands, and saying over their dead, when thou wast drunken, 
\v 54 Set forth the beauty of thy countenance? 
\v 55 The reward of thy whoredom \add shall be\add* in thy bosom, therefore shalt thou receive recompence. 
\v 56 Like as thou hast done unto my chosen, saith the Lord, \add even\add* so shall God do unto thee, and shall deliver thee into mischief. 
\v 57 Thy children shall die of hunger, and thou shalt fall through the sword: thy cities shall be broken down, and all thine shall perish with the sword in the field. 
\v 58  \add They\add* that be in the mountains shall die of hunger, and eat their own flesh, and drink \add their own\add* blood, for \add very\add* hunger of bread, and thirst of water. 
\v 59 Thou, \add as\add* unhappy shalt come through the sea, and receive plagues again. 
\v 60 And in the passage they shall rush on the idle city, and shall destroy some portion of thy land, and consume part of thy glory, and shall return to Babylon that was destroyed. 
\v 61 And thou shalt be cast down by them as stubble, and they shall be unto thee \add as\add* fire; 
\v 62 and shall consume thee, and thy cities, thy land, and thy mountains; all thy woods and \add thy\add* fruitful trees shall they burn up with fire. 
\v 63 Thy children shall they carry \add away\add* captive, and, \add look\add*, what thou hast, they shall spoil it, and mar the beauty of thy face. 
\c 16  
\p
\v 1 Woe be unto thee, Babylon, and Asia! woe be unto thee, Egypt, and Syria! 
\v 2 Gird up yourselves with cloths of sack and hair, bewail your children, and be sorry; for your destruction is at hand. 
\v 3 A sword is sent upon you, and who may turn it back? 
\v 4 a fire is sent among you, and who may quench it? 
\v 5 plagues are sent unto you, and what is he that may drive them away? 
\v 6 May any \add man\add* drive away a hungry lion in the wood? or may \add any one\add* quench the fire in stubble, when it hath begun to burn? 
\v 7 May one turn again the arrow that is shot of a strong archer? 
\v 8 The mighty Lord sendeth the plagues, and who is he that can drive them away? 
\v 9 A fire shall go forth from his wrath, and who is he that may quench it? 
\v 10 He shall cast lightnings, and who shall not fear? he shall thunder, and who shall not be afraid? 
\v 11 The Lord shall threaten, and who shall not be utterly beaten to powder at his presence? 
\v 12 The earth quaketh, and the foundations thereof; the sea ariseth up with waves from the deep, and the waves of it are troubled, and the fishes thereof \add also\add*, before the Lord, and before the glory of his power: 
\v 13 for strong \add is\add* his right hand that bendeth the bow, his arrows that he shooteth \add are\add* sharp, \add and\add* shall not miss, when they begin to be shot into the ends of the world. 
\v 14 Behold, the plagues are sent, and shall not return again, until they come upon the earth. 
\v 15 The fire is kindled, and shall not be put out, till it consume the foundation of the earth. 
\v 16 Like as an arrow which is shot of a mighty archer returneth not \add backward: even\add* so the plagues that shall be sent upon earth shall not return \add again\add*. 
\v 17 Woe is me! woe is me! who will deliver me in those days? 
\p
\v 18 The beginning of sorrows and great mournings; the beginning of famine and great death; the beginning of wars, and the powers shall stand in fear; the beginning of evils: what shall I do when these evils shall come? 
\v 19 Behold, famine and plague, tribulation and anguish, are sent \add as\add* scourges for amendment. 
\v 20 But for all these \add things\add* they shall not turn from their wickedness, nor be alway mindful of the scourges. 
\v 21 Behold, victuals shall be so good cheap upon earth, that they shall think themselves to be in good case, and \add even\add* then shall evils grow upon earth, sword, famine, and great confusion. 
\v 22 For many \add of them\add* that dwell upon earth shall perish of famine; and the other, that escape the hunger, shall the sword destroy. 
\v 23 And the dead shall be cast out as dung, and there shall be no man to comfort them: for the earth shall be wasted, and the cities shall be cast down. 
\v 24 There shall be no man left to till the earth, and to sow it. 
\v 25 The trees shall give fruit, and who shall gather them? 
\v 26 The grapes shall ripen, and who shall tread them? for \add all\add* places shall be desolate \add of men:\add* 
\v 27 so that one man shall desire to see another, and to hear his voice. 
\v 28 For of a city there shall be ten left, and two of the field, which shall hide themselves in the thick groves, and \add in\add* the clefts of the rocks. 
\v 29 As in an orchard of olives upon every tree there are left three or four olives; 
\v 30 or, when as a vineyard is gathered, there are left \add some\add* clusters of them that diligently seek through the vineyard: 
\v 31  \add even\add* so in those days there shall be three or four left by them that search their houses with the sword. 
\v 32 And the earth shall be laid waste, and the fields thereof shall wax old, and her ways and all her paths shall grow full of thorns, because no man shall travel therethrough. 
\v 33 The virgins shall mourn, having no bridegrooms; the women shall mourn, having no husbands; their daughters shall mourn, having no helpers. 
\v 34 In the wars shall their bridegrooms be destroyed, and their husbands shall perish of famine. 
\p
\v 35 Hear now these \add things\add*, and understand them, \add ye\add* servants of the Lord. 
\v 36 Behold the word of the Lord, receive it: believe not the gods of whom the Lord spake. 
\v 37 Behold, the plagues draw nigh, and are not slack. 
\v 38 As when a woman with child in the ninth month bringeth forth her son, within two or three hours of her birth \add great\add* pains compass her womb, which \add pains\add*, when the child cometh forth, they slack not a moment: 
\v 39  \add even\add* so shall not the plagues be slack to come upon the earth, and the world shall mourn, and sorrows shall come upon it on every side. 
\v 40 O my people, hear \add my\add* word: make you ready to the battle, and in \add those\add* evils be even as pilgrims upon the earth. 
\v 41 He that selleth, \add let him be\add* as he that fleeth \add away:\add* and he that buyeth, as one that will lose: 
\v 42 he that occupieth merchandise, as he that hath no profit \add by it:\add* and he that buildeth, as he that shall not dwell \add therein:\add* 
\v 43 he that soweth, as if he should not reap: so also he that planteth the vineyard, as he that shall not gather the grapes: 
\v 44 they that marry, as they that shall get no children; and they that marry not, as the widowers. 
\v 45  \add And\add* therefore they that labour, labour in vain: 
\v 46 for strangers shall reap their fruits, and spoil their goods, overthrow \add their\add* houses, and take their children captives, for in captivity and famine shall they get children. 
\v 47 And they that occupy their merchandise with robbery, the more they deck \add their\add* cities, their houses, \add their\add* possessions, and their own persons: 
\v 48 the more will I be angry with them for their sin, saith the Lord. 
\v 49 Like as a whore envieth a right honest and virtuous woman: 
\v 50 so shall righteousness hate iniquity, when she decketh herself, and shall accuse her to \add her\add* face, when he cometh that shall defend him that \add diligently\add* searcheth out every sin upon earth. 
\p
\v 51  \add And\add* therefore be ye not like thereunto, nor to the works thereof. 
\v 52 For yet a little, and iniquity shall be taken away out of the earth, and righteousness shall reign among you. 
\v 53 Let not the sinner say that he hath not sinned: for \add God\add* shall burn coals of fire upon his head, which saith before the Lord God and his glory, I have not sinned. 
\v 54 Behold, the Lord knoweth all the works of men, their imaginations, their thoughts, and their hearts: 
\v 55 which spake \add but\add* the word, Let the earth be made; and it was made: Let the heaven be made; and it was created. 
\v 56 In his word were the stars made, and he knoweth the number of them. 
\v 57 He searcheth the deep, and the treasures thereof; he hath measured the sea, and what it containeth. 
\v 58 He hath shut the sea in the midst of the waters, and with his word hath he hanged the earth upon the waters. 
\v 59 He spreadeth out the heavens like a vault; upon the waters hath he founded it. 
\v 60 In the desert hath he made springs of water, and pools upon the tops of the mountains, that the floods might pour down from the high rocks to water the earth. 
\v 61 He made man, and put his heart in the midst of the body, and gave him breath, life, and understanding. 
\v 62 Yea, and the spirit of Almighty God, which made all \add things\add*, and searcheth out all hidden \add things\add* in the secrets of the earth, 
\v 63  \add surely\add* he knoweth your inventions, and what you think in your hearts, \add even\add* them that sin, and would hide their sin. 
\v 64 Therefore hath the Lord exactly searched out all your works, and he will put you all to shame. 
\v 65 And when your sins are brought forth, ye shall be ashamed before men, and \add your own\add* sins shall be \add your\add* accusers in that day. 
\v 66 What will ye do? or how will ye hide your sins before God and his angels? 
\v 67 Behold, God \add himself is\add* the judge, fear him: leave off from your sins, and forget your iniquities, to meddle \add no more\add* with them for ever: so shall God lead you forth, and deliver \add you\add* from all trouble. 
\p
\v 68 For, behold, the burning wrath of a great multitude is kindled over you, and they shall take \add away\add* certain of you, and feed \add you\add*, being idle, with things offered unto idols. 
\v 69 And \add they\add* that consent unto them shall be had in derision and in reproach, and trodden under foot. 
\v 70 For there shall be in every place, and in the next cities, a great insurrection upon those that fear the Lord. 
\v 71 They shall be like mad \add men\add*, sparing none, but still spoiling and destroying those that fear the Lord. 
\v 72 For they shall waste and take away \add their\add* goods, and cast them out of their \add houses\add*. 
\v 73 Then shall they be known, who are my chosen; and they shall be tried as the gold in the fire. 
\v 74 Hear, O \add ye\add* my beloved, saith the Lord: behold, the days of trouble are at hand, but I will deliver you from the same. 
\v 75 Be ye not afraid, neither doubt; for God is your guide, 
\v 76 and \add the guide of them\add* who keep my commandments and precepts, saith the Lord God: let not your sins weigh you down, \add and\add* let not your iniquities lift up themselves. 
\v 77 Woe \add be unto them\add* that are bound with their sins, and covered with their iniquities, like as a field is covered over with bushes, and the path thereof covered with thorns, that no man may travel through! 
\v 78 It is left undressed, and is cast into the fire to be consumed therewith.
