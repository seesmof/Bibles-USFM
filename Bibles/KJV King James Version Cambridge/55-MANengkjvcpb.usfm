\v 1 O \sc Lord\sc*, Almighty God of our fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and of their righteous seed; 
\v 2 who hast made heaven and earth, with all the ornament thereof; 
\v 3 who hast bound the sea by the word of thy commandment; who hast shut \add up\add* the deep, and sealed it by thy terrible and glorious name; 
\v 4 whom all \add men\add* fear, and tremble before thy power; 
\v 5 for the majesty of thy glory cannot be borne, and thine angry threatening towards sinners \add is\add* importable; 
\v 6 but thy merciful promise \add is\add* unmeasurable and unsearchable; 
\v 7 for thou art the most high Lord, of great compassion, longsuffering, very merciful, and repentest of the evils of men: thou, O Lord, according to thy great goodness hast promised repentance and forgiveness to them that have sinned against thee: and of thine infinite mercies hast appointed repentance unto sinners, that \add they\add* may be saved. 
\p
\v 8 Thou therefore, O Lord, \add that art\add* the God of the just, hast not appointed repentance to the just, \add as\add* to Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, which have not sinned against thee; but thou hast appointed repentance unto me \add that am\add* a sinner: 
\v 9 for I have sinned above the number of the sands of the sea. My transgressions, O Lord, are multiplied: my transgressions are multiplied, and I am not worthy to behold and see the height of heaven for the multitude of mine iniquities. 
\v 10  \add I am\add* bowed down with many iron bands, that I cannot lift up mine head, neither have \add any\add* release: for I have provoked thy wrath, and done evil before thee: I did not thy will, neither kept I thy commandments: I have set up abominations, and have multiplied offences. 
\p
\v 11 Now therefore I bow the knee of mine heart, beseeching thee of grace. 
\v 12 I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned, and I acknowledge mine iniquities: 
\v 13 wherefore, I humbly beseech thee, forgive me, O Lord, forgive me, and destroy me not with mine iniquities. Be not angry with me for ever, by reserving evil for me; neither condemn me into the lower \add parts\add* of the earth. For thou art the God, \add even\add* the God of them that repent; 
\v 14 and in me thou wilt shew all thy goodness: for thou wilt save me, that am unworthy, according to thy great mercy. 
\v 15 Therefore I will praise thee for ever all the days of my life: for all the powers of the heavens do praise thee, and thine is the glory for ever and ever. Amen.
