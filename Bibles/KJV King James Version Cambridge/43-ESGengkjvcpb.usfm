\v 2  \sc In\sc* the second year of the reign of Artaxerxes the great, in the first \add day\add* of the month Nisan, Mardocheus the \add son\add* of Jairus, \add the son\add* of Semei, \add the son\add* of Cisai, of the tribe of Benjamin, had a dream; 
\v 3  \add who was\add* a Jew, and dwelt in the city of Susa, a great man, being a servitor in the king’s court. 
\v 4 He was also \add one\add* of the captives, which Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon carried from Jerusalem with Jechonias king of Judea; and this \add was\add* his dream: 
\v 5 behold a noise of a tumult, \add with\add* thunder, and earthquakes, and uproar in the land: 
\v 6 and behold, two great dragons came forth ready to fight, and their cry was great. 
\v 7 And at their cry all nations were prepared to battle, that \add they\add* might fight against the righteous people. 
\v 8 And lo, a day of darkness and obscurity, tribulation and anguish, affliction and great uproar, upon the earth. 
\v 9 And the whole righteous nation was troubled, fearing their own evils, and were ready to perish. 
\v 10 Then they cried unto God, and upon their cry, as it were from a little fountain, was made a great flood, \add even\add* much water. 
\v 11 The light and the sun rose up, and the lowly were exalted, and devoured the glorious. 
\v 12 Now when Mardocheus, who had seen this dream, and what God had determined to do, was awake, he bare this dream in mind, and until night by all means was desirous to know it. 
\cp 12
\p
\v 12a  \vp 1\vp* And Mardocheus took his rest in the court with Gabatha and Tharra, the two eunuchs of the king, and keepers of the palace. 
\v 13  \vp 2\vp* And he heard their devices, and searched out their purposes, and learned that they were about to lay hands upon Artaxerxes the king; and \add so\add* he certified the king of them. 
\v 14  \vp 3\vp* Then the king examined the two eunuchs, and after that they had confessed \add it\add*, they were strangled. 
\v 15  \vp 4\vp* And the king made a record of these things, and Mardocheus \add also\add* wrote thereof. 
\v 16  \vp 5\vp* So the king commanded Mardocheus to serve in the court, and for this he rewarded him. 
\v 17  \vp 6\vp* Howbeit Aman \add the son\add* of Amadathus the Agagite, who was in great honour with the king, sought to molest Mardocheus and his people because of the two eunuchs of the king.

\v 14  \vp 1\vp* The copy of the letters was this: The great king Artaxerxes writeth these \add things\add* to the princes and governors that are under \add him\add* from India unto Ethiopia, in an hundred and seven and twenty provinces. 
\v 15  \vp 2\vp* After that I became lord over many nations, and had dominion over the whole world, not lifted up with presumption of \add my\add* authority, but carrying \add myself\add* alway with equity and mildness, I purposed to settle my subjects continually in a quiet life, and making my kingdom peaceable, and open for passage to the utmost coasts, to renew peace, which is desired of all men. 
\v 16  \vp 3\vp* Now when I asked \add my\add* counsellers how this might be brought to pass, Aman, that excelled in wisdom among us, and was approved for his constant good will and stedfast fidelity, and had the honour of the second place in the kingdom, 
\v 17  \vp 4\vp* declared unto us, that in all nations throughout the world there was scattered a certain malicious people, that had laws contrary to all nations, and continually despised the commandments of kings, so as the uniting of our kingdoms, honourably intended by us, cannot go forward. 
\v 18  \vp 5\vp* Seeing then we understand that this people alone is continually in opposition unto all men, differing in the strange manner of \add their\add* laws, and evil affected to our state, working all the mischief they can, that \add our\add* kingdom may not be firmly established: 
\v 19  \vp 6\vp* therefore have we commanded, that \add all\add* they that are signified in writing unto you by Aman, who is ordained over the affairs, and is next unto us, shall all, with \add their\add* wives and children, be utterly destroyed by the sword of \add their\add* enemies, without all mercy and pity, the fourteenth \add day\add* of the twelfth month Adar of \add this\add* present year: 
\v 20  \vp 7\vp* that they, who of old and now \add also are\add* malicious, may in one day with violence go into the grave, and \add so\add* ever hereafter cause our affairs to be well settled, and without trouble.

\p
\v 18  \vp 8\vp* Then Mardocheus thought upon all the works of the Lord, and made his prayer unto him, 
\v 19  \vp 9\vp* Saying, O Lord, Lord, the King Almighty: for the whole \add world\add* is in thy power, and if thou hast appointed to save Israel, there is no man that can gainsay thee: 
\v 20  \vp 10\vp* for thou hast made heaven and earth, and all the wondrous \add things\add* under the heaven. 
\v 21  \vp 11\vp* Thou art Lord of all \add things\add*, and there is no man that can resist thee, \add which art\add* the Lord. 
\v 22  \vp 12\vp* Thou knowest all \add things, and\add* thou knowest, Lord, that \add it was\add* neither in contempt nor pride, nor for \add any\add* desire of glory, \add that\add* I did not bow down to proud Aman. 
\v 23  \vp 13\vp* For I could have been content with good will for the salvation of Israel to kiss the soles of his feet. 
\v 24  \vp 14\vp* But I did this, that I might not prefer the glory of man above the glory of God: neither will I worship any but thee, O God, neither will I do it in pride. 
\v 25  \vp 15\vp* And now, O Lord God \add and\add* King, spare thy people: for their eyes are upon us to bring us to nought; yea, they desire to destroy the inheritance, that hath been thine from the beginning. 
\v 26  \vp 16\vp* Despise not the portion, which thou hast delivered out of Egypt for thine own self. 
\v 27  \vp 17\vp* Hear my prayer, and be merciful unto thine inheritance: turn our sorrow into joy, that we may live, O Lord, and praise thy name: and destroy not the mouths of them that praise thee, O Lord. 
\p
\v 28  \vp 18\vp* All Israel in like manner cried most earnestly unto the Lord, because their death \add was\add* before their eyes. 
\cp 14
\p
\v 29  \vp 1\vp* Queen Esther also, being in fear of death, resorted unto the Lord: 
\v 30  \vp 2\vp* and laid away her glorious apparel, and put on the garments of anguish and mourning: and instead of precious ointments, she covered her head with ashes and dung, and she humbled her body greatly, and all the places of her joy she filled with her torn hair. 
\v 31  \vp 3\vp* And she prayed unto the Lord God of Israel, saying, 
\p O my Lord, thou only art our King: help me, desolate \add woman\add*, which have no helper but thee: 
\v 32  \vp 4\vp* for my danger \add is\add* in mine hand. 
\v 33  \vp 5\vp* From my youth up I have heard in the tribe of my family, that thou, O Lord, tookest Israel from among all people, and our fathers from all their predecessors, for a perpetual inheritance, and thou hast performed whatsoever thou didst promise them. 
\v 34  \vp 6\vp* And now we have sinned before thee: therefore hast thou given us into the hands of our enemies, 
\v 35  \vp 7\vp* because we worshipped their gods: O Lord, thou art righteous. 
\v 36  \vp 8\vp* Nevertheless it satisfieth them not, that we are in bitter captivity: but they have stricken hands with their idols, 
\v 37  \vp 9\vp* that \add they\add* will abolish the thing that thou with thy mouth hast ordained, and destroy thine inheritance, and stop the mouth of them that praise thee, and quench the glory of thy house, and of thine altar, 
\v 38  \vp 10\vp* and open the mouths of the heathen to \add set forth\add* the praises of the idols, and to magnify a fleshly king for ever. 
\v 39  \vp 11\vp* O Lord, give not thy sceptre unto them that be nothing, and let them not laugh at our fall; but turn their device upon themselves, and make him an example, that hath begun \add this\add* against us. 
\v 40  \vp 12\vp* Remember, O Lord, make thyself known in time of our affliction, and give me boldness, O King of the nations, and Lord of all power. 
\v 41  \vp 13\vp* Give \add me\add* eloquent speech in my mouth before the lion: turn his heart to hate him that fighteth against us, that there may be an end of him, and of \add all\add* that are likeminded to him: 
\v 42  \vp 14\vp* but deliver us with thine hand, and help me \add that am\add* desolate, and which have no other helper but thee. 
\v 43  \vp 15\vp* Thou knowest all \add things\add*, O Lord; thou knowest that I hate the glory of the unrighteous, and abhor the bed of the uncircumcised, and of all the heathen. 
\v 44  \vp 16\vp* Thou knowest my necessity: for I abhor the sign of my high estate, which is upon mine head in the days wherein I shew myself, \add and that\add* I abhor it as a menstruous rag, and \add that\add* I wear it not when I am private by myself, 
\v 45  \vp 17\vp* and \add that\add* thine handmaid hath not eaten \add at\add* Aman’s table, and \add that\add* I have not greatly esteemed the king’s feast, nor drunk the wine of the drink offerings. 
\v 46  \vp 18\vp* Neither had thine handmaid any joy since the day that I was brought hither to this present, but in thee, O Lord God of Abraham. 
\v 47  \vp 19\vp* O thou mighty God above all, hear the voice of the forlorn, and deliver us out of the hands of the mischievous, and deliver me out of my fear.

\v 1 And upon the third day, when she had ended her prayer, she laid away \add her\add* mourning garments, and put on her glorious \add apparel\add*. 
\v 2 And being gloriously adorned, after she had called upon God, who is the beholder and saviour of all \add things\add*, she took two maids with \add her:\add* 
\v 3 and upon the one she leaned, as carrying herself daintily; 
\v 4 and the other followed, bearing up her train. 
\v 5 And she \add was\add* ruddy through the perfection of her beauty, and her countenance \add was\add* cheerful and very amiable: but her heart \add was\add* in anguish for fear. 
\v 6 Then having passed through all the doors, she stood before the king, who sat upon his royal throne, and was clothed with all his robes of majesty, all \add glittering\add* with gold and precious stones; and he was very dreadful. 
\v 7 Then lifting up his countenance that shone with majesty, he looked very fiercely \add upon her:\add* and the queen fell down, and was pale, and fainted, and bowed \add herself\add* upon the head of the maid that went before her. 
\v 8 Then God changed the spirit of the king into mildness, who in a fear leaped from his throne, and took her in his arms, till she came to herself \add again\add*, and comforted her with loving words, and said unto her, 
\v 9 Esther, what is \add the matter?\add* I am thy brother, be of good cheer: 
\v 10 thou shalt not die, though our commandment be general: come near. 
\v 11 And \add so\add* he held up his golden sceptre, and laid \add it\add* upon her neck, 
\v 12 and embraced her, and said, Speak unto me. 
\v 13 Then said she unto him, I saw thee, \add my\add* lord, as an angel of God, and my heart was troubled for fear of thy majesty. 
\v 14 For wonderful art thou, lord, and thy countenance \add is\add* full of grace. 
\v 15 And as she was speaking, she fell \add down\add* for faintness. 
\v 16 Then the king was troubled, and all his servants comforted her.

\v 13  \vp 1\vp* The great king Artaxerxes unto the princes and governors of an hundred and seven and twenty provinces from India unto Ethiopia, \add and\add* unto \add all\add* our faithful subjects, greeting. 
\v 14  \vp 2\vp* Many, the more often they are honoured with the great bounty of their gracious princes, the more proud they are waxen, 
\v 15  \vp 3\vp* and endeavour to hurt not our subjects only, but not being able to bear abundance, do take in hand to practise also against those that do them good: 
\v 16  \vp 4\vp* and take not only thankfulness away from among men, but also lifted up with the glorious words of lewd \add persons\add*, that were never good, they think to escape the justice of God, that seeth all \add things, and\add* hateth evil. 
\v 17  \vp 5\vp* Oftentimes also fair speech of those, that are put in trust to manage \add their\add* friends’ affairs, hath caused many that are in authority to be partakers of innocent blood, and hath enwrapped \add them\add* in remediless calamities: 
\v 18  \vp 6\vp* beguiling with the falsehood and deceit of \add their\add* lewd disposition the innocency and goodness of princes. 
\v 19  \vp 7\vp* Now ye may see \add this\add*, as we have declared, not so much by ancient histories, as ye may, if ye search what hath been wickedly done of late through the pestilent behaviour of them that are unworthily placed in authority. 
\v 20  \vp 8\vp* And \add we\add* must take care for the time to come, that \add our\add* kingdom may be quiet and peaceable for all men, 
\v 21  \vp 9\vp* both by changing \add our\add* purposes, and always judging \add things\add* that are evident with more equal proceeding. 
\p
\v 22  \vp 10\vp* For Aman, a Macedonian, \add the son\add* of Amadatha, being indeed a stranger from the Persian blood, and far distant from our goodness, and as a stranger received of us, 
\v 23  \vp 11\vp* had so far forth obtained the favour that we shew toward every nation, as that he was called our father, and was continually honoured of all \add men, as\add* the next person unto the king. 
\v 24  \vp 12\vp* But he, not bearing \add his\add* great dignity, went about to deprive us of \add our\add* kingdom and life: 
\v 25  \vp 13\vp* having by manifold and cunning deceits sought \add of us\add* the destruction, as well of Mardocheus, who saved our life, and continually procured our good, as \add also\add* of blameless Esther, partaker of \add our\add* kingdom, with their whole nation. 
\v 26  \vp 14\vp* For by these means he thought, finding us destitute \add of friends\add*, to have translated the kingdom of the Persians to the Macedonians. 
\v 27  \vp 15\vp* But we find that the Jews, whom \add this\add* wicked wretch hath delivered to utter destruction, are no evildoers, but live by most just laws: 
\v 28  \vp 16\vp* and that they be children of the most high \add and\add* most mighty living God, who hath ordered the kingdom both unto us and to our progenitors in the most excellent manner. 
\v 29  \vp 17\vp* Wherefore ye shall do well not to put in execution the letters sent \add unto you\add* by Aman \add the son\add* of Amadatha. 
\v 30  \vp 18\vp* For he, that was the worker of these \add things\add*, is hanged at the gates of Susa with all \add his\add* family: God, who ruleth all \add things\add*, speedily rendering vengeance to him according to \add his\add* deserts. 
\v 31  \vp 19\vp* Therefore \add ye\add* shall publish the copy of this letter in all places, that the Jews may freely live after their own laws. 
\v 32  \vp 20\vp* And \add ye\add* shall aid them, that \add even\add* the same day, \add being\add* the thirteenth \add day\add* of the twelfth month Adar, they may be avenged on them, who in the time of \add their\add* affliction shall set upon them. 
\v 33  \vp 21\vp* For Almighty God hath turned to joy unto them the \add day\add*, wherein the chosen people should have perished. 
\v 34  \vp 22\vp* You shall therefore among your solemn feasts keep \add it\add* a high day with all feasting: 
\v 35  \vp 23\vp* that both now and hereafter there may be safety to us, and the well affected Persians; but to those which do conspire against us a memorial of destruction. 
\v 36  \vp 24\vp* Therefore every city and country whatsoever, which shall not do according to these \add things\add*, shall be destroyed without mercy with fire and sword, and shall be made not only unpassable for men, but also most hateful to wild beasts and fowls for ever. 
\c 10

\v 4 Then Mardocheus said, God hath done these \add things\add*. 
\v 5 For I remember a dream which I saw concerning these matters, and nothing thereof hath failed. 
\v 6 A little fountain became a river, and there was light, and the sun, and much water: \add this\add* river is Esther, whom the king married, and made queen: 
\v 7 and the two dragons are I and Aman. 
\v 8 And the nations \add were\add* those that were assembled to destroy the name of the Jews: 
\v 9 and my nation is this Israel, which cried to God, and were saved: for the Lord hath saved his people, and the Lord hath delivered us from all those evils, and God hath wrought signs and great wonders, which have not been done among the Gentiles. 
\v 10 Therefore hath he made two lots, one for the people of God, and another for all the Gentiles. 
\v 11 And these two lots came at the hour, and time, and day of judgment, before God amongst all nations. 
\v 12 So God remembered his people, and justified his inheritance. 
\v 13 Therefore those days shall be unto them in the month Adar, the fourteenth and fifteenth \add day\add* of the same month, with an assembly, and joy, and \add with\add* gladness before God, according to the generations for ever among his people.

\v 1 In the fourth year of the reign of Ptolemeus and Cleopatra, Dositheus, who said \add he\add* was a priest and Levite, and Ptolemeus his son, brought this epistle of Phurim, which they said was \add the same\add*, and that Lysimachus \add the son\add* of Ptolemeus, that was in Jerusalem, had interpreted \add it\add*.
