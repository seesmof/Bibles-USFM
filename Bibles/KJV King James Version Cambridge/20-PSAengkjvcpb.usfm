\c 1  
\q1
\v 1  \sc Blessed\sc* \add is\add* the man 
\q1 That walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, 
\q1 Nor standeth in the way of sinners, 
\q1 Nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful. 
\q1
\v 2 But his delight \add is\add* in the law of the \sc Lord\sc*; 
\q1 And in his law doth he meditate day and night. 
\q1
\v 3 And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, 
\q1 That bringeth forth his fruit in his season; 
\q1 His leaf also shall not wither; 
\q1 And whatsoever he doeth shall prosper. 
\q1
\v 4 The ungodly \add are\add* not so: 
\q1 But \add are\add* like the chaff which the wind driveth away. 
\q1
\v 5 Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, 
\q1 Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. 
\q1
\v 6 For the \sc Lord\sc* knoweth the way of the righteous: 
\q1 But the way of the ungodly shall perish. 
\c 2  
\q1
\v 1 Why do the heathen rage, 
\q1 And the people imagine a vain \add thing?\add* 
\q1
\v 2 The kings of the earth set themselves, 
\q1 And the rulers take counsel together, 
\q1 Against the \sc Lord\sc*, and against his anointed, \add saying\add*, 
\q1
\v 3 Let us break their bands asunder, 
\q1 And cast away their cords from us. 
\q1
\v 4 He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: 
\q1 The Lord shall have them in derision. 
\q1
\v 5 Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, 
\q1 And vex them in his sore displeasure. 
\q1
\v 6 Yet have I set my king 
\q1 Upon my holy hill of Zion. 
\q1
\v 7 I will declare the decree: 
\q1 The \sc Lord\sc* hath said unto me, Thou \add art\add* my Son; 
\q1 \add This\add* day have I begotten thee. 
\q1
\v 8 Ask of me, 
\q1 And I shall give \add thee\add* the heathen \add for\add* thine inheritance, 
\q1 And the uttermost parts of the earth \add for\add* thy possession. 
\q1
\v 9 Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; 
\q1 Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel. 
\q1
\v 10 Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: 
\q1 Be instructed, ye judges of the earth. 
\q1
\v 11 Serve the \sc Lord\sc* with fear, 
\q1 And rejoice with trembling. 
\q1
\v 12 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, 
\q1 And ye perish \add from\add* the way, 
\q1 When his wrath is kindled but a little: 
\q1 Blessed \add are\add* all they that put their trust in him. 
\c 3  
\d A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son. 
\q1
\v 1  \sc Lord\sc*, how are they increased that trouble me! 
\q1 Many \add are\add* they that rise up against me. 
\q1
\v 2 Many \add there be\add* which say of my soul, 
\q1 \add There is\add* no help for him in God. Selah. 
\q1
\v 3 But thou, O \sc Lord\sc*, \add art\add* a shield for me; 
\q1 My glory, and the lifter up of mine head. 
\q1
\v 4 I cried unto the \sc Lord\sc* \add with\add* my voice, 
\q1 And he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah. 
\q1
\v 5 I laid me down and slept; 
\q1 I awaked; for the \sc Lord\sc* sustained me. 
\q1
\v 6 I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, 
\q1 That have set \add themselves\add* against me round about. 
\q1
\v 7 Arise, O \sc Lord\sc*; save me, O my God: 
\q1 For thou hast smitten all mine enemies \add upon\add* the cheek bone; 
\q1 Thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly. 
\q1
\v 8 Salvation \add belongeth\add* unto the \sc Lord\sc*: 
\q1 Thy blessing \add is\add* upon thy people. Selah. 
\c 4  
\d To the chief Musician on Neginoth, A Psalm of David. 
\q1
\v 1 Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: 
\q1 Thou hast enlarged me \add when I was\add* in distress; 
\q1 Have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer. 
\q1
\v 2 O ye sons of men, how long \add will ye turn\add* my glory into shame? 
\q1 \add How long\add* will ye love vanity, \add and\add* seek after leasing? Selah. 
\q1
\v 3 But know that the \sc Lord\sc* hath set apart \add him that is\add* godly for himself: 
\q1 The \sc Lord\sc* will hear when I call unto him. 
\q1
\v 4 Stand in awe, and sin not: 
\q1 Commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah. 
\q1
\v 5 Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, 
\q1 And put your trust in the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\q1
\v 6  \add There be\add* many that say, Who will shew us \add any\add* good? 
\q1 \sc Lord\sc*, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us. 
\q1
\v 7 Thou hast put gladness in my heart, 
\q1 More than \add in\add* the time \add that\add* their corn and their wine increased. 
\q1
\v 8 I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: 
\q1 For thou, \sc Lord\sc*, only makest me dwell in safety. 
\c 5  
\d To the chief Musician upon Nehiloth, A Psalm of David. 
\q1
\v 1 Give ear to my words, O \sc Lord\sc*, 
\q1 Consider my meditation. 
\q1
\v 2 Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: 
\q1 For unto thee will I pray. 
\q1
\v 3 My voice shalt thou hear \add in\add* the morning, O \sc Lord\sc*; 
\q1 \add In\add* the morning will I direct \add my prayer\add* unto thee, and will look up. 
\q1
\v 4 For thou \add art\add* not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: 
\q1 Neither shall evil dwell \add with\add* thee. 
\q1
\v 5 The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: 
\q1 Thou hatest all workers of iniquity. 
\q1
\v 6 Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: 
\q1 The \sc Lord\sc* will abhor the bloody and deceitful man. 
\q1
\v 7 But \add as for\add* me, I will come \add into\add* thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: 
\q1 \add And\add* in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple. 
\q1
\v 8 Lead me, O \sc Lord\sc*, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; 
\q1 Make thy way straight before my face. 
\q1
\v 9 For \add there is\add* no faithfulness in their mouth; 
\q1 Their inward \add part is\add* very wickedness; 
\q1 Their throat \add is\add* an open sepulchre; 
\q1 They flatter with their tongue. 
\q1
\v 10 Destroy thou them, O God; 
\q1 Let them fall by their own counsels; 
\q1 Cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; 
\q1 For they have rebelled against thee. 
\q1
\v 11 But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: 
\q1 Let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: 
\q1 Let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee. 
\q1
\v 12 For thou, \sc Lord\sc*, wilt bless the righteous; 
\q1 \add With\add* favour wilt thou compass him as \add with\add* a shield. 
\c 6  
\d To the chief Musician on Neginoth upon Sheminith, A Psalm of David. 
\q1
\v 1 O \sc Lord\sc*, rebuke me not in thine anger, 
\q1 Neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. 
\q1
\v 2 Have mercy upon me, O \sc Lord\sc*; for I \add am\add* weak: 
\q1 O \sc Lord\sc*, heal me; for my bones are vexed. 
\q1
\v 3 My soul is also sore vexed: 
\q1 But thou, O \sc Lord\sc*, how long? 
\q1
\v 4 Return, O \sc Lord\sc*, deliver my soul: 
\q1 O save me for thy mercy’s sake. 
\q1
\v 5 For in death \add there is\add* no remembrance of thee: 
\q1 In the grave who shall give thee thanks? 
\q1
\v 6 I am weary with my groaning; 
\q1 All the night make I my bed to swim; 
\q1 I water my couch with my tears. 
\q1
\v 7 Mine eye is consumed because of grief; 
\q1 It waxeth old because of all mine enemies. 
\q1
\v 8 Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; 
\q1 For the \sc Lord\sc* hath heard the voice of my weeping. 
\q1
\v 9 The \sc Lord\sc* hath heard my supplication; 
\q1 The \sc Lord\sc* will receive my prayer. 
\q1
\v 10 Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: 
\q1 Let them return \add and\add* be ashamed suddenly. 
\c 7  
\d Shiggaion of David, which he sang unto the \sc Lord\sc*, concerning the words of Cush the Benjamite. 
\q1
\v 1 O \sc Lord\sc* my God, in thee do I put my trust: 
\q1 Save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me: 
\q1
\v 2 Lest he tear my soul like a lion, 
\q1 Rending \add it\add* in pieces, while \add there is\add* none to deliver. 
\q1
\v 3 O \sc Lord\sc* my God, if I have done this; 
\q1 If there be iniquity in my hands; 
\q1
\v 4 If I have rewarded evil \add unto\add* him that was at peace with me; 
\q1 (Yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:) 
\q1
\v 5 Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take \add it\add*; 
\q1 Yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, 
\q1 And lay mine honour in the dust. Selah. 
\q1
\v 6 Arise, O \sc Lord\sc*, in thine anger, 
\q1 Lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: 
\q1 And awake for me \add to\add* the judgment \add that\add* thou hast commanded. 
\q1
\v 7 So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: 
\q1 For their sakes therefore return thou on high. 
\q1
\v 8 The \sc Lord\sc* shall judge the people: 
\q1 Judge me, O \sc Lord\sc*, according to my righteousness, 
\q1 And according to mine integrity \add that is\add* in me. 
\q1
\v 9 O let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: 
\q1 For the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins. 
\q1
\v 10 My defence \add is\add* of God, 
\q1 Which saveth the upright in heart. 
\q1
\v 11 God judgeth the righteous, 
\q1 And God is angry \add with the wicked\add* every day. 
\q1
\v 12 If he turn not, he will whet his sword; 
\q1 He hath bent his bow, and made it ready. 
\q1
\v 13 He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; 
\q1 He ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors. 
\q1
\v 14 Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, 
\q1 And hath conceived mischief, 
\q1 And brought forth falsehood. 
\q1
\v 15 He made a pit, and digged it, 
\q1 And is fallen into the ditch \add which\add* he made. 
\q1
\v 16 His mischief shall return upon his own head, 
\q1 And his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate. 
\q1
\v 17 I will praise the \sc Lord\sc* according to his righteousness: 
\q1 And will sing \add praise\add* to the name of the \sc Lord\sc* most High. 
\c 8  
\d To the chief Musician upon Gittith, A Psalm of David. 
\q1
\v 1 O \sc Lord\sc* our Lord, 
\q1 How excellent \add is\add* thy name in all the earth! 
\q1 Who hast set thy glory above the heavens. 
\q1
\v 2 Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength 
\q1 Because of thine enemies, 
\q1 That \add thou\add* mightest still the enemy and the avenger. 
\q1
\v 3 When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, 
\q1 The moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; 
\q1
\v 4 What \add is\add* man, that thou art mindful of him? 
\q1 And the son of man, that thou visitest him? 
\q1
\v 5 For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, 
\q1 And hast crowned him \add with\add* glory and honour. 
\q1
\v 6 Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; 
\q1 Thou hast put all \add things\add* under his feet: 
\q1
\v 7 All sheep and oxen, 
\q1 Yea, and the beasts of the field; 
\q1
\v 8 The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, 
\q1 \add And whatsoever\add* passeth \add through\add* the paths of the seas. 
\q1
\v 9 O \sc Lord\sc* our Lord, 
\q1 How excellent \add is\add* thy name in all the earth! 
\c 9  
\d To the chief Musician upon Muth-labben, A Psalm of David. 
\q1
\v 1 (א) I will praise \add thee\add*, O \sc Lord\sc*, with my whole heart; 
\q1 I will shew forth all thy marvellous works. 
\q1
\v 2 I will be glad and rejoice in thee: 
\q1 I will sing \add praise\add* to thy name, O thou most High. 
\q1
\v 3 (ב) When mine enemies are turned back, 
\q1 They shall fall and perish at thy presence. 
\q1
\v 4 For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; 
\q1 Thou satest in the throne judging right. 
\q1
\v 5 (ג) Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, 
\q1 Thou hast put out their name for ever and ever. 
\q1
\v 6 (ה) O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: 
\q1 And thou hast destroyed cities; 
\q1 Their memorial is perished \add with\add* them. 
\q1
\v 7 (ו) But the \sc Lord\sc* shall endure for ever: 
\q1 He hath prepared his throne for judgment. 
\q1
\v 8 And he shall judge the world in righteousness, 
\q1 He shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness. 
\q1
\v 9 The \sc Lord\sc* also will be a refuge for the oppressed, 
\q1 A refuge in times of trouble. 
\q1
\v 10 And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: 
\q1 For thou, \sc Lord\sc*, hast not forsaken them that seek thee. 
\q1
\v 11 (ז) Sing \add praises\add* to the \sc Lord\sc*, which dwelleth in Zion: 
\q1 Declare among the people his doings. 
\q1
\v 12 When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: 
\q1 He forgetteth not the cry of the humble. 
\q1
\v 13 (ח) Have mercy upon me, O \sc Lord\sc*; 
\q1 Consider my trouble \add which I suffer\add* of them that hate me, 
\q1 Thou that liftest me up from the gates of death: 
\q1
\v 14 That I may shew forth all thy praise 
\q1 In the gates of the daughter of Zion: 
\q1 I will rejoice in thy salvation. 
\q1
\v 15 (ט) The heathen are sunk down in the pit \add that\add* they made: 
\q1 In the net which they hid is their own foot taken. 
\q1
\v 16 The \sc Lord\sc* is known \add by\add* the judgment \add which\add* he executeth: 
\q1 The wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. 
\q1 Higgaion. Selah. 
\q1
\v 17 (י) The wicked shall be turned into hell, 
\q1 \add And\add* all the nations that forget God. 
\q1
\v 18 (כ) For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: 
\q1 The expectation of the poor shall \add not\add* perish for ever. 
\q1
\v 19 Arise, O \sc Lord\sc*; let not man prevail: 
\q1 Let the heathen be judged in thy sight. 
\q1
\v 20 Put them in fear, O \sc Lord\sc*: 
\q1 \add That\add* the nations may know themselves \add to be but\add* men. Selah. 
\c 10  
\q1
\v 1 (ל) Why standest thou afar off, O \sc Lord\sc*? 
\q1 \add Why\add* hidest thou \add thyself\add* in times of trouble? 
\q1
\v 2 The wicked in \add his\add* pride doth persecute the poor: 
\q1 Let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined. 
\q1
\v 3 For the wicked boasteth of his heart’s desire, 
\q1 And blesseth the covetous, \add whom\add* the \sc Lord\sc* abhorreth. 
\q1
\v 4 The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek \add after God:\add* 
\q1 God \add is\add* not \add in\add* all his thoughts. 
\q1
\v 5 His ways are always grievous; 
\q1 Thy judgments \add are\add* far above out of his sight: 
\q1 \add As for\add* all his enemies, he puffeth at them. 
\q1
\v 6 He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: 
\q1 For \add I shall\add* never \add be\add* in adversity. 
\q1
\v 7 His mouth is full \add of\add* cursing and deceit and fraud: 
\q1 Under his tongue \add is\add* mischief and vanity. 
\q1
\v 8 He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: 
\q1 In the secret places doth he murder the innocent: 
\q1 His eyes are privily set against the poor. 
\q1
\v 9 He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: 
\q1 He lieth in wait to catch the poor: 
\q1 He doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net. 
\q1
\v 10 He croucheth, \add and\add* humbleth himself, 
\q1 That the poor may fall by his strong \add ones\add*. 
\q1
\v 11 He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: 
\q1 He hideth his face; he will never see \add it\add*. 
\q1
\v 12 (ק) Arise, O \sc Lord\sc*; O God, lift up thine hand: 
\q1 Forget not the humble. 
\q1
\v 13 Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? 
\q1 He hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require \add it\add*. 
\q1
\v 14 (ר) Thou hast seen \add it;\add* for thou beholdest mischief and spite, 
\q1 To requite \add it\add* with thy hand: 
\q1 The poor committeth \add himself\add* unto thee; 
\q1 Thou art the helper of the fatherless. 
\q1
\v 15 (ש) Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil \add man:\add* 
\q1 Seek out his wickedness \add till\add* thou find none. 
\q1
\v 16 The \sc Lord\sc* \add is\add* King for ever and ever: 
\q1 The heathen are perished out of his land. 
\q1
\v 17 (ת) \sc Lord\sc*, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: 
\q1 Thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear: 
\q1
\v 18 To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, 
\q1 That the man of the earth may no more oppress. 
\c 11  
\d To the chief Musician, \add A Psalm\add* of David. 
\q1
\v 1 In the \sc Lord\sc* put I my trust: 
\q1 How say ye to my soul, 
\q1 Flee \add as\add* a bird \add to\add* your mountain? 
\q1
\v 2 For lo, the wicked bend \add their\add* bow, 
\q1 They make ready their arrow upon the string, 
\q1 That \add they\add* may privily shoot at the upright in heart. 
\q1
\v 3 If the foundations be destroyed, 
\q1 What can the righteous do? 
\q1
\v 4 The \sc Lord\sc* \add is\add* in his holy temple, 
\q1 The \sc Lord’s\sc* throne \add is\add* in heaven: 
\q1 His eyes behold, 
\q1 His eyelids try, the children of men. 
\q1
\v 5 The \sc Lord\sc* trieth the righteous: 
\q1 But the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth. 
\q1
\v 6 Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, 
\q1 And a horrible tempest: \add this shall be\add* the portion of their cup. 
\q1
\v 7 For the righteous \sc Lord\sc* loveth righteousness; 
\q1 His countenance doth behold the upright. 
\c 12  
\d To the chief Musician upon Sheminith, A Psalm of David. 
\q1
\v 1 Help, \sc Lord\sc*; for the godly \add man\add* ceaseth; 
\q1 For the faithful fail from among the children of men. 
\q1
\v 2 They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: 
\q1 \add With\add* flattering lips \add and\add* with a double heart do they speak. 
\q1
\v 3 The \sc Lord\sc* shall cut off all flattering lips, 
\q1 \add And\add* the tongue that speaketh proud \add things:\add* 
\q1
\v 4 Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; 
\q1 Our lips \add are\add* our own: who \add is\add* lord over us? 
\q1
\v 5 For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, 
\q1 Now will I arise, saith the \sc Lord\sc*; 
\q1 I will set \add him\add* in safety \add from him that\add* puffeth at him. 
\q1
\v 6 The words of the \sc Lord\sc* \add are\add* pure words: 
\q1 \add As\add* silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. 
\q1
\v 7 Thou shalt keep them, O \sc Lord\sc*, 
\q1 Thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever. 
\q1
\v 8 The wicked walk on every side, 
\q1 When the vilest men are exalted. 
\c 13  
\d To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. 
\q1
\v 1 How long wilt thou forget me, O \sc Lord\sc*? for ever? 
\q1 How long wilt thou hide thy face from me? 
\q1
\v 2 How long shall I take counsel in my soul, 
\q1 \add Having\add* sorrow in my heart daily? 
\q1 How long shall mine enemy be exalted over me? 
\q1
\v 3 Consider \add and\add* hear me, O \sc Lord\sc* my God: 
\q1 Lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the \add sleep of\add* death; 
\q1
\v 4 Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; 
\q1 \add And\add* those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved. 
\q1
\v 5 But I have trusted in thy mercy; 
\q1 My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation. 
\q1
\v 6 I will sing unto the \sc Lord\sc*, because he hath dealt bountifully with me. 
\c 14  
\d To the chief Musician, \add A Psalm\add* of David. 
\q1
\v 1 The fool hath said in his heart, \add There is\add* no God. 
\q1 They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, 
\q1 \add There is\add* none that doeth good. 
\q1
\v 2 The \sc Lord\sc* looked down from heaven upon the children of men, 
\q1 To see if there were \add any\add* that did understand, \add and\add* seek God. 
\q1
\v 3 They are all gone aside, they are \add all\add* together become filthy: 
\q1 \add There is\add* none that doeth good, no, not one. 
\q1
\v 4 Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? 
\q1 Who eat up my people \add as\add* they eat bread, 
\q1 \add And\add* call not upon the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\q1
\v 5 There were they in great fear: 
\q1 For God \add is\add* in the generation of the righteous. 
\q1
\v 6 You have shamed the counsel of the poor, 
\q1 Because the \sc Lord\sc* \add is\add* his refuge. 
\q1
\v 7 O that the salvation of Israel \add were come\add* out of Zion! 
\q1 When the \sc Lord\sc* bringeth back the captivity of his people, 
\q1 Jacob shall rejoice, \add and\add* Israel shall be glad. 
\c 15  
\d A Psalm of David. 
\q1
\v 1  \sc Lord\sc*, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? 
\q1 Who shall dwell in thy holy hill? 
\q1
\v 2 He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, 
\q1 And speaketh the truth in his heart. 
\q1
\v 3  \add He that\add* backbiteth not with his tongue, 
\q1 Nor doeth evil to his neighbour, 
\q1 Nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour. 
\q1
\v 4 In whose eyes a vile \add person\add* is contemned; 
\q1 But he honoureth them that fear the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\q1 \add He that\add* sweareth to \add his own\add* hurt, and changeth not. 
\q1
\v 5  \add He that\add* putteth not out his money to usury, 
\q1 Nor taketh reward against the innocent. 
\q1 He that doeth these \add things\add* shall never be moved. 
\c 16  
\d Michtam of David. 
\q1
\v 1 Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust. 
\q1
\v 2  \add O my soul\add*, thou hast said unto the \sc Lord\sc*, Thou \add art\add* my Lord: 
\q1 My goodness \add extendeth\add* not to thee;

\q1
\v 2 Let my sentence come forth from thy presence;

\q1
\v 3 Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited \add me\add* in the night;

\q1 I am purposed \add that\add* my mouth shall not transgress. 
\q1
\v 4 Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips

\q1
\v 5 Hold up my goings in thy paths,

\q1
\v 6 I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God:

\q1
\v 7 Shew thy marvellous loving-kindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust \add in thee\add*

\d To the chief Musician, \add A Psalm\add* of David, the servant of the \sc Lord\sc*, who spake unto the \sc Lord\sc* the words of this song in the day \add that\add* the \sc Lord\sc* delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul: And he said, 
\q1
\v 1 I will love thee, O \sc Lord\sc*, my strength. 
\q1
\v 2 The \sc Lord\sc* \add is\add* my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;

\q1
\v 3 I will call upon the \sc Lord\sc*, who is \add worthy\add* to be praised: 
\q1 So shall I be saved from mine enemies. 
\q1
\v 4 The sorrows of death compassed me, 
\q1 And the floods of ungodly men made me afraid. 
\q1
\v 5 The sorrows of hell compassed me about: 
\q1 The snares of death prevented me. 
\q1
\v 6 In my distress I called upon the \sc Lord\sc*, 
\q1 And cried unto my God: 
\q1 He heard my voice out of his temple, 
\q1 And my cry came before him, \add even\add* into his ears. 
\q1
\v 7 Then the earth shook and trembled; 
\q1 The foundations also of the hills moved 
\q1 And were shaken, because he was wroth. 
\q1
\v 8 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, 
\q1 And fire out of his mouth devoured: 
\q1 Coals were kindled by it. 
\q1
\v 9 He bowed the heavens also, and came down: 
\q1 And darkness \add was\add* under his feet. 
\q1
\v 10 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: 
\q1 Yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind. 
\q1
\v 11 He made darkness his secret place; 
\q1 His pavilion round about him 
\q1 \add Were\add* dark waters \add and\add* thick clouds of the skies. 
\q1
\v 12 At the brightness \add that was\add* before him his thick clouds passed, 
\q1 Hail-\add stones\add* and coals of fire. 
\q1
\v 13 The \sc Lord\sc* also thundered in the heavens, 
\q1 And the Highest gave his voice; 
\q1 Hail-\add stones\add* and coals of fire. 
\q1
\v 14 Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; 
\q1 And he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them. 
\q1
\v 15 Then the channels of waters were seen, 
\q1 And the foundations of the world were discovered 
\q1 At thy rebuke, O \sc Lord\sc*, 
\q1 At the blast of the breath of thy nostrils. 
\q1
\v 16 He sent from above, he took me, 
\q1 He drew me out of many waters. 
\q1
\v 17 He delivered me from my strong enemy, 
\q1 And from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me. 
\q1
\v 18 They prevented me in the day of my calamity: 
\q1 But the \sc Lord\sc* was my stay. 
\q1
\v 19 He brought me forth also into a large place; 
\q1 He delivered me, because he delighted in me. 
\q1
\v 20 The \sc Lord\sc* rewarded me according to my righteousness; 
\q1 According to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me. 
\q1
\v 21 For I have kept the ways of the \sc Lord\sc*, 
\q1 And have not wickedly departed from my God. 
\q1
\v 22 For all his judgments \add were\add* before me, 
\q1 And I did not put away his statutes from me. 
\q1
\v 23 I was also upright before him, 
\q1 And I kept myself from mine iniquity. 
\q1
\v 24 Therefore hath the \sc Lord\sc* recompensed me according to my righteousness, 
\q1 According to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight. 
\q1
\v 25 With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; 
\q1 With an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright; 
\q1
\v 26 With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; 
\q1 And with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward. 
\q1
\v 27 For thou wilt save the afflicted people; 
\q1 But wilt bring down high looks. 
\q1
\v 28 For thou wilt light my candle: 
\q1 The \sc Lord\sc* my God will enlighten my darkness. 
\q1
\v 29 For by thee I have run \add through\add* a troop; 
\q1 And by my God have I leaped over a wall. 
\q1
\v 30  \add As for\add* God, his way \add is\add* perfect: 
\q1 The word of the \sc Lord\sc* is tried: 
\q1 He \add is\add* a buckler to all those that trust in him. 
\q1
\v 31 For who \add is\add* God save the \sc Lord\sc*? 
\q1 Or who \add is\add* a rock save our God? 
\q1
\v 32  \add It is\add* God that girdeth me \add with\add* strength, 
\q1 And maketh my way perfect. 
\q1
\v 33 He maketh my feet like hinds’ \add feet\add*, 
\q1 And setteth me upon my high places. 
\q1
\v 34 He teacheth my hands to war, 
\q1 So that a bow of steel is broken \add by\add* mine arms. 
\q1
\v 35 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: 
\q1 And thy right hand hath holden me up, 
\q1 And thy gentleness hath made me great. 
\q1
\v 36 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, 
\q1 That my feet did not slip. 
\q1
\v 37 I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: 
\q1 Neither did I turn again till they were consumed. 
\q1
\v 38 I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: 
\q1 They are fallen under my feet. 
\q1
\v 39 For thou hast girded me \add with\add* strength unto the battle: 
\q1 Thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me. 
\q1
\v 40 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; 
\q1 That I might destroy them that hate me. 
\q1
\v 41 They cried, but \add there was\add* none to save \add them:\add* 
\q1 \add Even\add* unto the \sc Lord\sc*, but he answered them not. 
\q1
\v 42 Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: 
\q1 I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets. 
\q1
\v 43 Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; 
\q1 \add And\add* thou hast made me the head of the heathen: 
\q1 A people \add whom\add* I have not known shall serve me. 
\q1
\v 44 As soon as they hear \add of me\add*, they shall obey me: 
\q1 The strangers shall submit themselves unto me. 
\q1
\v 45 The strangers shall fade away, 
\q1 And be afraid out of their close places.

\v 46 The \sc Lord\sc* liveth; and blessed \add be\add* my rock;

\q1
\v 47  \add It is\add* God that avengeth me,

\q1
\v 48 He delivereth me from mine enemies: 
\q1 Yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: 
\q1 Thou hast delivered me from the violent man.

\v 49 Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O \sc Lord\sc*, among the heathen,

\q1
\v 14 I behaved myself as though \add he had been\add* my friend \add or\add* brother:

\v 15 But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together:

\v 2 For he flattereth himself in his own eyes,

\q1
\v 3 The words of his mouth \add are\add* iniquity and deceit: 
\q1 He hath left off to be wise, \add and\add* to do good.

\v 4 He deviseth mischief upon his bed;

\v 12 Thou sellest thy people for nought,

\v 18 Our heart is not turned back,

\v 16  \add As for\add* me, I will call upon God;

\q1 For there were many with me. 
\q1
\v 19 God shall hear, and afflict them,

\q1 Because they have no changes,

\v 20 He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: 
\q1 He hath broken his covenant. 
\q1
\v 21  \add The words of\add* his mouth were smoother than butter, but war \add was\add* in his heart:

\q1 He shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.

\v 9  \add Because of\add* his strength will I wait upon thee:

\q1
\v 2 I sink in deep mire, where \add there is\add* no standing: 
\q1 I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me. 
\q1
\v 3 I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried:

\q1
\v 4 They that hate me without a cause are moe than the hairs of mine head: 
\q1 They that would destroy me, \add being\add* mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty:

\q1
\v 5 O God, thou knowest my foolishness; 
\q1 And my sins are not hid from thee. 
\q1
\v 6 Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord \sc God\sc* of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: 
\q1 Let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel. 
\q1
\v 7 Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; 
\q1 Shame hath covered my face. 
\q1
\v 8 I am become a stranger unto my brethren, 
\q1 And an alien unto my mother’s children. 
\q1
\v 9 For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; 
\q1 And the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me. 
\q1
\v 10 When I wept, \add and chastened\add* my soul with fasting, 
\q1 That was to my reproach. 
\q1
\v 11 I made sackcloth also my garment; 
\q1 And I became a proverb to them. 
\q1
\v 12 They that sit in the gate speak against me;

\q1
\v 13 But \add as for\add* me, my prayer \add is\add* unto thee, O \sc Lord\sc*, \add in\add* an acceptable time: 
\q1 O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation. 
\q1
\v 14 Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: 
\q1 Let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters. 
\q1
\v 15 Let not the waterflood overflow me,

\q1 And let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.

\v 16 Hear me, O \sc Lord\sc*; for thy lovingkindness \add is\add* good: 
\q1 Turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies. 
\q1
\v 17 And hide not thy face from thy servant;

\q1
\v 18 Draw nigh unto my soul, \add and\add* redeem it:

\q1
\v 19 Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour:

\q1
\v 20 Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: 
\q1 And I looked \add for some\add* to take pity, but \add there was\add* none; 
\q1 And for comforters, but I found none. 
\q1
\v 21 They gave me also gall for my meat; 
\q1 And in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink. 
\q1
\v 22 Let their table become a snare before them: 
\q1 And \add that which should have been\add* for \add their\add* welfare, \add let it become\add* a trap. 
\q1
\v 23 Let their eyes be darkened, that \add they\add* see not;

\q1
\v 24 Pour out thine indignation upon them,

\q1
\v 25 Let their habitation be desolate; 
\q1 \add And\add* let none dwell in their tents. 
\q1
\v 26 For they persecute \add him\add* whom thou hast smitten;

\q1
\v 27 Add iniquity unto their iniquity:

\v 28 Let them be blotted out of the book of the living,

\b
\q1
\v 29 But I \add am\add* poor and sorrowful:

\v 30 I will praise the name of God with a song;

\v 34 Let the heaven and earth praise him,

\v 35 For God will save Zion,

\q1
\v 4 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee:

\q1
\v 9 Cast me not off in the time of old age;

\q1
\v 10 For mine enemies speak against me; 
\q1 And they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together, 
\q1
\v 11 Saying, God hath forsaken him:

\q1
\v 12 O God, be not far from me:

\v 13 Let them be confounded \add and\add* consumed that are adversaries to my soul;

\q1
\v 4 I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly:

\q1
\v 5 Lift not up your horn on high: 
\q1 Speak \add not\add* with a stiff neck. 
\q1
\v 6 For promotion \add cometh\add* neither from the east,

\q1
\v 7 But God \add is\add* the judge:

\q1
\v 8 For in the hand of the \sc Lord\sc* \add there is\add* a cup, and the wine is red; 
\q1 It is full \add of\add* mixture; and he poureth out of the same: 
\q1 But the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring \add them\add* out, \add and\add* drink \add them\add*. 
\q1
\v 9 But I will declare for ever;

\v 2 In Salem also is his tabernacle,

\v 5 The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: 
\q1 And none of the men of might have found their hands. 
\q1
\v 6 At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, 
\q1 Both the chariot and horse \add are\add* cast into a dead sleep. 
\q1
\v 7 Thou, \add even\add* thou, \add art\add* to be feared: 
\q1 And who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry? 
\q1
\v 8 Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; 
\q1 The earth feared, and was still, 
\q1
\v 9 When God arose to judgment, 
\q1 To save all the meek of the earth. Selah. 
\b
\q1
\v 10 Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee:

\q1
\v 11 Vow, and pay unto the \sc Lord\sc* your God:

\v 12 He shall cut off the spirit of princes: \add He is\add* terrible to the kings of the earth. 
\c 77  
\d To the chief Musician, to Jeduthun, A Psalm of Asaph. 
\q1
\v 1 I cried unto God \add with\add* my voice, 
\q1 \add Even\add* unto God \add with\add* my voice; and he gave ear unto me. 
\q1
\v 2 In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: 
\q1 My sore ran in the night, and ceased not: 
\q1 My soul refused to be comforted. 
\q1
\v 3 I remembered God, and was troubled: 
\q1 I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah. 
\b
\q1
\v 4 Thou holdest mine eyes waking: 
\q1 I am \add so\add* troubled that I cannot speak. 
\q1
\v 5 I have considered the days of old, 
\q1 The years of ancient times. 
\q1
\v 6 I call to remembrance my song in the night: 
\q1 I commune with mine own heart: 
\q1 And my spirit made diligent search. 
\q1
\v 7 Will the Lord cast off for ever? 
\q1 And will he be favourable no more? 
\q1
\v 8 Is his mercy clean gone for ever? 
\q1 Doth \add his\add* promise fail for evermore? 
\q1
\v 9 Hath God forgotten to be gracious? 
\q1 Hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah. 
\b
\q1
\v 10 And I said, This \add is\add* my infirmity: 
\q1 \add But I will remember\add* the years of the right hand of the most High. 
\q1
\v 11 I will remember the works of the \sc Lord\sc*: 
\q1 Surely I will remember thy wonders of old. 
\q1
\v 12 I will meditate also of all thy work, And talk of thy doings. 
\q1
\v 13 Thy way, O God, \add is\add* in the sanctuary: 
\q1 Who \add is so\add* great a God as \add our\add* God? 
\q1
\v 14 Thou \add art\add* the God that doest wonders: 
\q1 Thou hast declared thy strength among the people. 
\q1
\v 15 Thou hast with \add thine\add* arm redeemed thy people, 
\q1 The sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah. 
\b
\q1
\v 16 The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: 
\q1 The depths also were troubled. 
\q1
\v 17 The clouds poured out water: 
\q1 The skies sent out a sound: 
\q1 Thine arrows also went abroad. 
\q1
\v 18 The voice of thy thunder \add was\add* in the heaven: 
\q1 The lightnings lightened the world: 
\q1 The earth trembled and shook. 
\q1
\v 19 Thy way \add is\add* in the sea, 
\q1 And thy path in the great waters, 
\q1 And thy footsteps are not known.

\v 20 Thou leddest thy people like a flock

\q1
\v 1 Give ear, O my people, to my law: 
\q1 Incline your ears to the words of my mouth. 
\q1
\v 2 I will open my mouth in a parable: 
\q1 I will utter dark sayings of old: 
\q1
\v 3 Which we have heard and known, 
\q1 And our fathers have told us. 
\q1
\v 4 We will not hide \add them\add* from their children, 
\q1 Shewing to the generation to come 
\q1 The praises of the \sc Lord\sc*, and his strength, 
\q1 And his wonderful works that he hath done. 
\b
\q1
\v 5 For he established a testimony in Jacob, 
\q1 And appointed a law in Israel, 
\q1 Which he commanded our fathers, 
\q1 That \add they\add* should make them known to their children: 
\q1
\v 6 That the generation to come might know \add them, even\add* the children \add which\add* should be born; 
\q1 \add Who\add* should arise and declare \add them\add* to their children: 
\q1
\v 7 That they might set their hope in God, 
\q1 And not forget the works of God, 
\q1 But keep his commandments: 
\q1
\v 8 And might not be as their fathers, 
\q1 A stubborn and rebellious generation; 
\q1 A generation \add that\add* set not their heart aright, 
\q1 And whose spirit was not stedfast with God. 
\q1
\v 9 The children of Ephraim, \add being\add* armed, \add and\add* carrying bows, 
\q1 Turned \add back\add* in the day of battle. 
\q1
\v 10 They kept not the covenant of God, 
\q1 And refused to walk in his law; 
\q1
\v 11 And forgat his works, 
\q1 And his wonders that he had shewed them. 
\q1
\v 12 Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, 
\q1 In the land of Egypt, \add in\add* the field of Zoan. 
\q1
\v 13 He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; 
\q1 And he made the waters to stand as a heap. 
\q1
\v 14 In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, 
\q1 And all the night with a light of fire. 
\q1
\v 15 He clave the rocks in the wilderness, 
\q1 And gave \add them\add* drink as \add out of\add* the great depths. 
\q1
\v 16 He brought streams also out of the rock, 
\q1 And caused waters to run down like rivers. 
\q1
\v 17 And they sinned yet more against him 
\q1 By provoking the most High in the wilderness. 
\q1
\v 18 And they tempted God in their heart 
\q1 By asking meat for their lust. 
\q1
\v 19 Yea, they spake against God; they said, 
\q1 Can God furnish a table in the wilderness? 
\q1
\v 20 Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, 
\q1 And the streams overflowed; 
\q1 Can he give bread also? 
\q1 Can he provide flesh for his people? 
\b
\q1
\v 21 Therefore the \sc Lord\sc* heard \add this\add*, and was wroth: 
\q1 So a fire was kindled against Jacob, 
\q1 And anger also came up against Israel; 
\q1
\v 22 Because they believed not in God, 
\q1 And trusted not in his salvation: 
\q1
\v 23 Though he had commanded the clouds from above, 
\q1 And opened the doors of heaven, 
\q1
\v 24 And had rained down manna upon them to eat, 
\q1 And had given them \add of\add* the corn of heaven. 
\q1
\v 25 Man did eat angels’ food: 
\q1 He sent them meat to the full. 
\q1
\v 26 He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: 
\q1 And by his power he brought in the south wind. 
\q1
\v 27 He rained flesh also upon them as dust, 
\q1 And feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea: 
\q1
\v 28 And he let \add it\add* fall in the midst of their camp, 
\q1 Round about their habitations. 
\q1
\v 29 So they did eat, and were well filled: 
\q1 For he gave them their own desire; 
\q1
\v 30 They were not estranged from their lust. 
\q1 But while their meat \add was\add* yet in their mouths, 
\q1
\v 31 The wrath of God came upon them, 
\q1 And slew the fattest of them, 
\q1 And smote down the chosen \add men\add* of Israel. 
\q1
\v 32 For all this they sinned still, 
\q1 And believed not for his wondrous works. 
\q1
\v 33 Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, 
\q1 And their years in trouble. 
\q1
\v 34 When he slew them, then they sought him: 
\q1 And they returned and inquired early after God. 
\q1
\v 35 And they remembered that God \add was\add* their rock, 
\q1 And the high God their redeemer. 
\q1
\v 36 Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, 
\q1 And they lied unto him with their tongues. 
\q1
\v 37 For their heart was not right with him, 
\q1 Neither were they stedfast in his covenant. 
\q1
\v 38 But he, \add being\add* full of compassion, forgave \add their\add* iniquity, and destroyed \add them\add* not: 
\q1 Yea, many a time turned he his anger away, 
\q1 And did not stir up all his wrath. 
\q1
\v 39 For he remembered that they \add were but\add* flesh; 
\q1 A wind that passeth away, and cometh not again. 
\b
\q1
\v 40 How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, 
\q1 \add And\add* grieve him in the desert! 
\q1
\v 41 Yea, they turned \add back\add* and tempted God, 
\q1 And limited the Holy One of Israel. 
\q1
\v 42 They remembered not his hand: 
\q1 \add Nor\add* the day when he delivered them from the enemy. 
\q1
\v 43 How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, 
\q1 And his wonders in the field of Zoan: 
\q1
\v 44 And had turned their rivers into blood; 
\q1 And their floods, \add that\add* they could not drink. 
\q1
\v 45 He sent divers sorts \add of flies\add* among them, which devoured them; 
\q1 And frogs, which destroyed them. 
\q1
\v 46 He gave also their increase unto the caterpillar, 
\q1 And their labour unto the locust. 
\q1
\v 47 He destroyed their vines with hail, 
\q1 And their sycomore trees with frost. 
\q1
\v 48 He gave up their cattle also to the hail, 
\q1 And their flocks to hot thunderbolts. 
\q1
\v 49 He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, 
\q1 Wrath, and indignation, and trouble, 
\q1 \add By\add* sending evil angels \add among them\add*. 
\q1
\v 50 He made a way to his anger; 
\q1 He spared not their soul from death, 
\q1 But gave their life over to the pestilence; 
\q1
\v 51 And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; 
\q1 The chief of \add their\add* strength in the tabernacles of Ham: 
\q1
\v 52 But made his own people to go forth like sheep, 
\q1 And guided them in the wilderness like a flock. 
\q1
\v 53 And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: 
\q1 But the sea overwhelmed their enemies. 
\q1
\v 54 And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, 
\q1 \add Even to\add* this mountain, \add which\add* his right hand had purchased. 
\q1
\v 55 He cast out the heathen also before them, 
\q1 And divided them an inheritance by line, 
\q1 And made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. 
\q1
\v 56 Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, 
\q1 And kept not his testimonies: 
\q1
\v 57 But turned \add back\add*, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: 
\q1 They were turned aside like a deceitful bow. 
\q1
\v 58 For they provoked him to anger with their high places, 
\q1 And moved him to jealousy with their graven images. 
\q1
\v 59 When God heard \add this\add*, he was wroth, 
\q1 And greatly abhorred Israel: 
\q1
\v 60 So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, 
\q1 The tent \add which\add* he placed among men; 
\q1
\v 61 And delivered his strength into captivity, 
\q1 And his glory into the enemy’s hand. 
\q1
\v 62 He gave his people over also unto the sword; 
\q1 And was wroth with his inheritance. 
\q1
\v 63 The fire consumed their young men; 
\q1 And their maidens were not given to marriage. 
\q1
\v 64 Their priests fell by the sword; 
\q1 And their widows made no lamentation. 
\q1
\v 65 Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, 
\q1 \add And\add* like a mighty \add man\add* that shouteth by reason of wine. 
\q1
\v 66 And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: 
\q1 He put them to a perpetual reproach. 
\q1
\v 67 Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, 
\q1 And chose not the tribe of Ephraim: 
\q1
\v 68 But chose the tribe of Judah, 
\q1 The mount Zion which he loved. 
\q1
\v 69 And he built his sanctuary like high \add palaces\add*, 
\q1 Like the earth which he hath established for ever. 
\q1
\v 70 He chose David also his servant, 
\q1 And took him from the sheepfolds: 
\q1
\v 71 From following the \add ewes\add* great with young he brought him 
\q1 To feed Jacob his people, 
\q1 And Israel his inheritance. 
\q1
\v 72 So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; 
\q1 And guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.

\d A Psalm of Asaph. 
\q1
\v 1 O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance;

\q1 They have laid Jerusalem on heaps. 
\q1
\v 2 The dead bodies of thy servants have they given 
\q1 \add To be\add* meat unto the fowls of the heaven, 
\q1 The flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth. 
\q1
\v 3 Their blood have they shed like water 
\q1 Round about Jerusalem; and \add there was\add* none to bury \add them\add*. 
\q1
\v 4 We are become a reproach to our neighbours,

\q1
\v 5 How long, \sc Lord\sc*? wilt thou be angry for ever? 
\q1 Shall thy jealousy burn like fire? 
\q1
\v 6 Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, 
\q1 And upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name. 
\q1
\v 7 For they have devoured Jacob, 
\q1 And laid waste his dwelling place. 
\q1
\v 8 O remember not against us former iniquities: 
\q1 Let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us: 
\q1 For we are brought very low. 
\q1
\v 9 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: 
\q1 And deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name’s sake. 
\q1
\v 10 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where \add is\add* their God? 
\q1 Let him be known among the heathen in our sight 
\q1 \add By\add* the revenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed. 
\q1
\v 11 Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee,

\v 12 And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom 
\q1 Their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.

\v 8 Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee:

\q1
\v 2 Let my prayer come before thee:

\v 3 For my soul is full of troubles:

\v 4 I am counted with them that go down into the pit:

\q1
\v 6 Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit,

\v 7 Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, 
\q1 And thou hast afflicted \add me with\add* all thy waves. Selah.

\q1
\v 8 Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me;

\q1
\v 9 Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction:

\v 14 Justice and judgment \add are\add* the habitation of thy throne:

\v 20 I have found David my servant;

\v 22 The enemy shall not exact upon him; 
\q1 Nor the son of wickedness afflict him. 
\q1
\v 23 And I will beat down his foes before his face,

\q1
\v 24 But my faithfulness and my mercy \add shall be\add* with him: 
\q1 And in my name shall his horn be exalted. 
\q1
\v 25 I will set his hand also in the sea,

\q1
\v 26 He shall cry unto me, Thou \add art\add* my Father, 
\q1 My God, and the rock of my salvation. 
\q1
\v 27 Also I will make him \add my\add* firstborn,

\v 29 His seed also will I make \add to endure\add* for ever, 
\q1 And his throne as the days of heaven. 
\q1
\v 30 If his children forsake my law, 
\q1 And walk not in my judgments; 
\q1
\v 31 If they break my statutes, 
\q1 And keep not my commandments; 
\q1
\v 32 Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, 
\q1 And their iniquity with stripes. 
\q1
\v 33 Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, 
\q1 Nor suffer my faithfulness to fail. 
\q1
\v 34 My covenant will I not break, 
\q1 Nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips. 
\q1
\v 35 Once have I sworn by my holiness

\v 40 Thou hast broken down all his hedges;

\q1
\v 41 All that pass by the way spoil him: 
\q1 He is a reproach to his neighbours. 
\q1
\v 42 Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; 
\q1 Thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice. 
\q1
\v 43 Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, 
\q1 And hast not made him to stand in the battle. 
\q1
\v 44 Thou hast made his glory to cease, 
\q1 And cast his throne down to the ground. 
\q1
\v 45 The days of his youth hast thou shortened:

\q1
\v 1 The \sc Lord\sc* reigneth, he is clothed with majesty;

\q1
\v 2 Thy throne is established of old: 
\q1 Thou \add art\add* from everlasting. 
\q1
\v 3 The floods have lifted up, O \sc Lord\sc*, 
\q1 The floods have lifted up their voice;

\q1
\v 4 The \sc Lord\sc* on high \add is\add* mightier

\q1
\v 4  \add How long\add* shall they utter \add and\add* speak hard \add things?\add* 
\q1 \add And\add* all the workers of iniquity boast themselves? 
\q1
\v 5 They break in pieces thy people, O \sc Lord\sc*, 
\q1 And afflict thine heritage. 
\q1
\v 6 They slay the widow and the stranger, 
\q1 And murder the fatherless. 
\q1
\v 7 Yet they say, The \sc Lord\sc* shall not see,

\q1
\v 8 Understand, ye brutish among the people:

\v 9 He that planted the ear, shall he not hear?

\v 10 He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct?

\q1
\v 11 The \sc Lord\sc* knoweth the thoughts of man,

\q1
\v 12 Blessed \add is\add* the man whom thou chastenest, O \sc Lord\sc*,

\q1
\v 13 That \add thou\add* mayest give him rest from the days of adversity,

\q1
\v 14 For the \sc Lord\sc* will not cast off his people,

\q1
\v 15 But judgment shall return unto righteousness: 
\q1 And all the upright in heart shall follow it. 
\b
\q1
\v 16 Who will rise up for me against the evildoers?

\v 17 Unless the \sc Lord\sc* \add had been\add* my help,

\v 18 When I said, My foot slippeth;

\v 19 In the multitude of my thoughts within me

\q1
\v 20 Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship \add with\add* thee,

\q1
\v 21 They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous,

\q1
\v 22 But the \sc Lord\sc* is my defence; 
\q1 And my God \add is\add* the rock of my refuge. 
\q1
\v 23 And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity,

\v 9 When your fathers tempted me,

\q1
\v 10 Forty years long was I grieved with \add this\add* generation,

\q1
\v 4 His lightnings enlightened the world:

\v 2 I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou come unto me?

\q1
\v 2 Hide not thy face from me 
\q1 In the day \add when\add* I am in trouble; incline thine ear unto me: 
\q1 In the day \add when\add* I call answer me speedily. 
\q1
\v 3 For my days are consumed like smoke, 
\q1 And my bones are burnt as a hearth. 
\q1
\v 4 My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; 
\q1 So that I forget to eat my bread. 
\q1
\v 5 By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin. 
\q1
\v 6 I am like a pelican of the wilderness: 
\q1 I am like an owl of the desert. 
\q1
\v 7 I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the housetop. 
\q1
\v 8 Mine enemies reproach me all the day; 
\q1 \add And\add* they that are mad against me are sworn against me. 
\q1
\v 9 For I have eaten ashes like bread, 
\q1 And mingled my drink with weeping, 
\q1
\v 10 Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: 
\q1 For thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down. 
\q1
\v 11 My days \add are\add* like a shadow that declineth; 
\q1 And I am withered like grass. 
\b
\q1
\v 12 But thou, O \sc Lord\sc*, shalt endure for ever; 
\q1 And thy remembrance unto all generations. 
\q1
\v 13 Thou shalt arise, \add and\add* have mercy upon Zion: 
\q1 For the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come. 
\q1
\v 14 For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, 
\q1 And favour the dust thereof. 
\q1
\v 15 So the heathen shall fear the name of the \sc Lord\sc*, 
\q1 And all the kings of the earth thy glory. 
\q1
\v 16 When the \sc Lord\sc* shall build up Zion, 
\q1 He shall appear in his glory. 
\q1
\v 17 He will regard the prayer of the destitute, 
\q1 And not despise their prayer. 
\q1
\v 18 This shall be written for the generation to come: 
\q1 And the people which \add shall be\add* created shall praise the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\q1
\v 19 For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; 
\q1 From heaven did the \sc Lord\sc* behold the earth; 
\q1
\v 20 To hear the groaning of the prisoner; 
\q1 To loose those that are appointed to death; 
\q1
\v 21 To declare the name of the \sc Lord\sc* in Zion, 
\q1 And his praise in Jerusalem; 
\q1
\v 22 When the people are gathered together, 
\q1 And the kingdoms, to serve the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\q1
\v 23 He weakened my strength in the way; 
\q1 He shortened my days. 
\q1
\v 24 I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: 
\q1 Thy years \add are\add* throughout all generations. 
\q1
\v 25 Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: 
\q1 And the heavens \add are\add* the work of thy hands. 
\q1
\v 26 They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: 
\q1 Yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; 
\q1 As a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: 
\q1
\v 27 But thou \add art\add* the same, 
\q1 And thy years shall have no end. 
\q1
\v 28 The children of thy servants shall continue, 
\q1 And their seed shall be established before thee.

\q1
\v 6 The \sc Lord\sc* executeth righteousness

\q1
\v 10 He hath not dealt with us after our sins; 
\q1 Nor rewarded us according to our iniquities. 
\q1
\v 11 For as the heaven is high above the earth, 
\q1 \add So\add* great is his mercy toward them that fear him. 
\q1
\v 12 As far as the east is from the west, 
\q1 \add So\add* far hath he removed our transgressions from us. 
\q1
\v 13 Like as a father pitieth \add his\add* children, 
\q1 \add So\add* the \sc Lord\sc* pitieth them that fear him. 
\q1

\q1
\v 15  \add As for\add* man, his days \add are\add* as grass: 
\q1 As a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.

\q1
\v 13 He watereth the hills from his chambers:

\v 14 He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, 
\q1 And herb for the service of man: 
\q1 That \add he\add* may bring forth food out of the earth;

\v 29 Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: 
\q1 Thou takest away their breath, they die, 
\q1 And return to their dust. 
\q1
\v 30 Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: 
\q1 And thou renewest the face of the earth.

\q1
\v 31 The glory of the \sc Lord\sc* shall endure for ever: 
\q1 The \sc Lord\sc* shall rejoice in his works. 
\q1
\v 32 He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth:

\q1
\v 33 I will sing unto the \sc Lord\sc* as long as I live: 
\q1 I will sing \add praise\add* to my God while I have my being. 
\q1
\v 34 My meditation of him shall be sweet: 
\q1 I will be glad in the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\q1
\v 35 Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, 
\q1 And let the wicked be no more. 
\q1 Bless thou the \sc Lord\sc*, O my soul.

\c 105  
\q1
\v 1 O give thanks unto the \sc Lord\sc*; call upon his name:

\q1
\v 2 Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: 
\q1 Talk ye of all his wondrous works. 
\q1
\v 3 Glory ye in his holy name: 
\q1 Let the heart of them rejoice that seek the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\q1
\v 4 Seek the \sc Lord\sc*, and his strength: 
\q1 Seek his face evermore. 
\q1
\v 5 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; 
\q1 His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth; 
\q1
\v 6 O ye seed of Abraham his servant, 
\q1 Ye children of Jacob, his chosen. 
\q1
\v 7 He \add is\add* the \sc Lord\sc* our God: 
\q1 His judgments \add are\add* in all the earth. 
\q1
\v 8 He hath remembered his covenant for ever, 
\q1 The word \add which\add* he commanded to a thousand generations. 
\q1
\v 9 Which \add covenant\add* he made with Abraham, 
\q1 And his oath unto Isaac; 
\q1
\v 10 And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, 
\q1 \add And\add* to Israel \add for\add* an everlasting covenant: 
\q1
\v 11 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, 
\q1 The lot of your inheritance: 
\q1
\v 12 When they were \add but a few\add* men in number; 
\q1 Yea, \add very\add* few, and strangers in it. 
\q1
\v 13 When they went from one nation to another, 
\q1 From \add one\add* kingdom to another people; 
\q1
\v 14 He suffered no man to do them wrong: 
\q1 Yea, he reproved kings for their sakes; 
\q1
\v 15  \add Saying\add*, Touch not mine anointed, 
\q1 And do my prophets no harm. 
\q1
\v 16 Moreover, he called \add for\add* a famine upon the land: 
\q1 He brake the whole staff of bread. 
\q1
\v 17 He sent a man before them, 
\q1 \add Even\add* Joseph, \add who\add* was sold for a servant: 
\q1
\v 18 Whose feet they hurt with fetters: 
\q1 He was laid \add in\add* iron: 
\q1
\v 19 Until the time that his word came: 
\q1 The word of the \sc Lord\sc* tried him. 
\q1
\v 20 The king sent and loosed him; 
\q1 \add Even\add* the ruler of the people, and let him go free. 
\q1
\v 21 He made him lord of his house, 
\q1 And ruler of all his substance: 
\q1
\v 22 To bind his princes at his pleasure; 
\q1 And teach his senators wisdom. 
\q1
\v 23 Israel also came \add into\add* Egypt; 
\q1 And Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham. 
\q1
\v 24 And he increased his people greatly; 
\q1 And made them stronger than their enemies. 
\q1
\v 25 He turned their heart to hate his people, 
\q1 To deal subtilly with his servants. 
\q1
\v 26 He sent Moses his servant; 
\q1 \add And\add* Aaron whom he had chosen. 
\q1
\v 27 They shewed his signs among them, 
\q1 And wonders in the land of Ham. 
\q1
\v 28 He sent darkness, and made it dark; 
\q1 And they rebelled not against his word. 
\q1
\v 29 He turned their waters into blood, 
\q1 And slew their fish. 
\q1
\v 30 Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, 
\q1 In the chambers of their kings. 
\q1
\v 31 He spake, and there came divers sorts \add of flies\add*, 
\q1 \add And\add* lice in all their coasts. 
\q1
\v 32 He gave them hail \add for\add* rain, 
\q1 \add And\add* flaming fire in their land. 
\q1
\v 33 He smote their vines also and their fig trees; 
\q1 And brake the trees of their coasts. 
\q1
\v 34 He spake, and the locusts came, 
\q1 And caterpillars, and that without number, 
\q1
\v 35 And did eat up all the herbs in their land, 
\q1 And devoured the fruit of their ground. 
\q1
\v 36 He smote also all the first-born in their land, 
\q1 The chief of all their strength. 
\q1
\v 37 He brought them forth also with silver and gold: 
\q1 And \add there was\add* not \add one\add* feeble \add person\add* among their tribes. 
\q1
\v 38 Egypt was glad when they departed: 
\q1 For the fear of them that fell upon them. 
\q1
\v 39 He spread a cloud for a covering; 
\q1 And fire to give light in the night. 
\q1
\v 40  \add The people\add* asked, and he brought quails, 
\q1 And satisfied them \add with\add* the bread of heaven. 
\q1
\v 41 He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; 
\q1 They ran in the dry \add places like\add* a river. 
\q1
\v 42 For he remembered his holy promise, 
\q1 \add And\add* Abraham his servant. 
\q1
\v 43 And he brought forth his people with joy, 
\q1 \add And\add* his chosen with gladness: 
\q1
\v 44 And gave them the lands of the heathen: 
\q1 And they inherited the labour of the people; 
\q1
\v 45 That they might observe his statutes, 
\q1 And keep his laws. 
\q1 Praise ye the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\c 106  
\q1
\v 1 Praise ye the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\q1 O give thanks unto the \sc Lord\sc*; for \add he is\add* good: 
\q1 For his mercy \add endureth\add* for ever. 
\q1
\v 2 Who can utter the mighty acts of the \sc Lord\sc*? 
\q1 \add Who\add* can shew forth all his praise? 
\q1
\v 3 Blessed \add are\add* they that keep judgment, 
\q1 \add And\add* he that doeth righteousness at all times. 
\q1
\v 4 Remember me, O \sc Lord\sc*, with the favour \add that thou bearest\add* unto thy people: 
\q1 O visit me with thy salvation; 
\q1
\v 5 That \add I\add* may see the good of thy chosen, 
\q1 That \add I\add* may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, 
\q1 That \add I\add* may glory with thine inheritance. 
\q1
\v 6 We have sinned with our fathers, 
\q1 We have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly. 
\q1
\v 7 Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; 
\q1 They remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; 
\q1 But provoked \add him\add* at the sea, \add even\add* at the Red sea. 
\q1
\v 8 Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake, 
\q1 That \add he\add* might make his mighty power to be known. 
\q1
\v 9 He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: 
\q1 So he led them through the depths, as \add through\add* the wilderness. 
\q1
\v 10 And he saved them from the hand of him that hated \add them\add*, 
\q1 And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. 
\q1
\v 11 And the waters covered their enemies: 
\q1 There was not one of them left. 
\q1
\v 12 Then believed they his words; 
\q1 They sang his praise. 
\q1
\v 13 They soon forgat his works; 
\q1 They waited not for his counsel: 
\q1
\v 14 But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, 
\q1 And tempted God in the desert. 
\q1
\v 15 And he gave them their request; 
\q1 But sent leanness into their soul. 
\q1
\v 16 They envied Moses also in the camp, 
\q1 \add And\add* Aaron the saint of the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\q1
\v 17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, 
\q1 And covered the company of Abiram. 
\q1
\v 18 And a fire was kindled in their company; 
\q1 The flame burnt up the wicked. 
\q1
\v 19 They made a calf in Horeb, 
\q1 And worshipped the molten image. 
\q1
\v 20 Thus they changed their glory 
\q1 Into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass. 
\q1
\v 21 They forgat God their saviour, 
\q1 Which had done great \add things\add* in Egypt; 
\q1
\v 22 Wondrous works in the land of Ham, 
\q1 \add And\add* terrible \add things\add* by the Red sea. 
\q1
\v 23 Therefore he said that \add he\add* would destroy them, 
\q1 Had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, 
\q1 To turn away his wrath, lest \add he\add* should destroy \add them\add*. 
\q1
\v 24 Yea, they despised the pleasant land, 
\q1 They believed not his word: 
\q1
\v 25 But murmured in their tents, 
\q1 \add And\add* hearkened not unto the voice of the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\q1
\v 26 Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, 
\q1 To overthrow them in the wilderness: 
\q1
\v 27 To overthrow their seed also among the nations, 
\q1 And to scatter them in the lands. 
\q1
\v 28 They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor, 
\q1 And ate the sacrifices of the dead. 
\q1
\v 29 Thus they provoked \add him\add* to anger with their inventions: 
\q1 And the plague brake in upon them. 
\q1
\v 30 Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: 
\q1 And \add so\add* the plague was stayed. 
\q1
\v 31 And \add that\add* was counted unto him for righteousness 
\q1 Unto all generations for evermore. 
\q1
\v 32 They angered \add him\add* also at the waters of strife, 
\q1 So that it went ill with Moses for their sakes: 
\q1
\v 33 Because they provoked his spirit, 
\q1 So that he spake unadvisedly with his lips. 
\q1
\v 34 They did not destroy the nations, 
\q1 \add Concerning\add* whom the \sc Lord\sc* commanded them: 
\q1
\v 35 But were mingled among the heathen, 
\q1 And learned their works. 
\q1
\v 36 And they served their idols: 
\q1 Which were a snare unto them. 
\q1
\v 37 Yea, they sacrificed their sons 
\q1 And their daughters unto devils, 
\q1
\v 38 And shed innocent blood, 
\q1 \add Even\add* the blood of their sons and of their daughters, 
\q1 Whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: 
\q1 And the land was polluted with blood. 
\q1
\v 39 Thus were they defiled with their own works, 
\q1 And went a whoring with their own inventions. 
\q1
\v 40 Therefore was the wrath of the \sc Lord\sc* kindled against his people, 
\q1 Insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance. 
\q1
\v 41 And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; 
\q1 And they that hated them ruled over them. 
\q1
\v 42 Their enemies also oppressed them, 
\q1 And they were brought into subjection under their hand. 
\q1
\v 43 Many times did he deliver them; 
\q1 But they provoked \add him\add* with their counsel, 
\q1 And were brought low for their iniquity. 
\q1
\v 44 Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, 
\q1 When he heard their cry: 
\q1
\v 45 And he remembered for them his covenant, 
\q1 And repented according to the multitude of his mercies. 
\q1
\v 46 He made them also to be pitied 
\q1 Of all those that carried them captives. 
\b
\q1
\v 47 Save us, O \sc Lord\sc* our God, 
\q1 And gather us from among the heathen, 
\q1 To give thanks unto thy holy name, 
\q1 \add And\add* to triumph in thy praise. 
\q1
\v 48 Blessed \add be\add* the \sc Lord\sc* God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: 
\q1 And let all the people say, Amen. 
\q1 Praise ye the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\c 107  
\q1
\v 1 O give thanks unto the \sc Lord\sc*, for \add he is\add* good: 
\q1 For his mercy \add endureth\add* for ever. 
\q1
\v 2 Let the redeemed of the \sc Lord\sc* say \add so\add*, 
\q1 Whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy; 
\q1
\v 3 And gathered them out of the lands, 
\q1 From the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south. 
\b
\q1
\v 4 They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; 
\q1 They found no city to dwell in. 
\q1
\v 5 Hungry and thirsty, 
\q1 Their soul fainted in them. 
\q1
\v 6 Then they cried unto the \sc Lord\sc* in their trouble, 
\q1 \add And\add* he delivered them out of their distresses. 
\q1
\v 7 And he led them forth by the right way, 
\q1 That \add they\add* might go to a city of habitation. 
\q1
\v 8 Oh that \add men\add* would praise the \sc Lord\sc* \add for\add* his goodness, 
\q1 And \add for\add* his wonderful works to the children of men! 
\q1
\v 9 For he satisfieth the longing soul, 
\q1 And filleth the hungry soul \add with\add* goodness. 
\b
\q1
\v 10 Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, 
\q1 \add Being\add* bound in affliction and iron; 
\q1
\v 11 Because they rebelled against the words of God, 
\q1 And contemned the counsel of the most High: 
\q1
\v 12 Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; 
\q1 They fell down, and \add there was\add* none to help. 
\q1
\v 13 Then they cried unto the \sc Lord\sc* in their trouble, 
\q1 \add And\add* he saved them out of their distresses. 
\q1
\v 14 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, 
\q1 And brake their bands in sunder. 
\q1
\v 15 Oh that \add men\add* would praise the \sc Lord\sc* \add for\add* his goodness, 
\q1 And \add for\add* his wonderful works to the children of men! 
\q1
\v 16 For he hath broken the gates of brass, 
\q1 And cut the bars of iron in sunder. 
\b
\q1
\v 17 Fools because of their transgression, 
\q1 And because of their iniquities, are afflicted. 
\q1
\v 18 Their soul abhorreth all \add manner of\add* meat; 
\q1 And they draw near unto the gates of death. 
\q1
\v 19 Then they cry unto the \sc Lord\sc* in their trouble, 
\q1 He saveth them out of their distresses. 
\q1
\v 20 He sent his word, and healed them, 
\q1 And delivered \add them\add* from their destructions. 
\q1
\v 21 Oh that \add men\add* would praise the \sc Lord\sc* \add for\add* his goodness, 
\q1 And \add for\add* his wonderful works to the children of men! 
\q1
\v 22 And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, 
\q1 And declare his works with rejoicing. 
\b
\q1
\v 23 They that go down to the sea in ships, 
\q1 That do business in great waters; 
\q1
\v 24 These see the works of the \sc Lord\sc*, 
\q1 And his wonders in the deep. 
\q1
\v 25 For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, 
\q1 Which lifteth up the waves thereof. 
\q1
\v 26 They mount up \add to\add* the heaven, they go down \add again to\add* the depths: 
\q1 Their soul is melted because of trouble. 
\q1
\v 27 They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken \add man\add*, 
\q1 And are at their wit’s end. 
\q1
\v 28 Then they cry unto the \sc Lord\sc* in their trouble, 
\q1 And he bringeth them out of their distresses. 
\q1
\v 29 He maketh the storm a calm, 
\q1 So that the waves thereof are still. 
\q1
\v 30 Then are they glad because they be quiet; 
\q1 So he bringeth them unto their desired haven. 
\q1
\v 31 Oh that \add men\add* would praise the \sc Lord\sc* \add for\add* his goodness, 
\q1 And \add for\add* his wonderful works to the children of men! 
\q1
\v 32 Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, 
\q1 And praise him in the assembly of the elders. 
\b
\q1
\v 33 He turneth rivers into a wilderness, 
\q1 And the watersprings into dry ground; 
\q1
\v 34 A fruitful land into barrenness, 
\q1 For the wickedness of them that dwell therein. 
\q1
\v 35 He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, 
\q1 And dry ground into watersprings; 
\q1
\v 36 And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, 
\q1 That they may prepare a city for habitation; 
\q1
\v 37 And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, 
\q1 Which may yield fruits of increase. 
\q1
\v 38 He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; 
\q1 And suffereth not their cattle to decrease. 
\q1
\v 39 Again, they are minished and brought low 
\q1 Through oppression, affliction, and sorrow. 
\q1
\v 40 He poureth contempt upon princes, 
\q1 And causeth them to wander in the wilderness, \add where there is\add* no way. 
\q1
\v 41 Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, 
\q1 And maketh \add him\add* families like a flock. 
\q1
\v 42 The righteous shall see \add it\add*, and rejoice: 
\q1 And all iniquity shall stop her mouth.

\d To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. 
\q1
\v 1 Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;

\v 2 For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: 
\q1 They have spoken against me \add with\add* a lying tongue. 
\q1
\v 3 They compassed me about also \add with\add* words of hatred; 
\q1 And fought against me without a cause. 
\q1
\v 4 For my love they are my adversaries:

\v 5 And they have rewarded me evil for good,

\v 8 Let his days be few;

\v 10 Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg:

\v 11 Let the extortioner catch all that he hath;

\q1
\v 12 Let there be none to extend mercy unto him:

\q1
\v 13 Let his posterity be cut off;

\q1
\v 14 Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the \sc Lord\sc*; 
\q1 And let not the sin of his mother be blotted out. 
\q1
\v 15 Let them be before the \sc Lord\sc* continually, 
\q1 That he may cut off the memory of them from the earth. 
\q1
\v 16 Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, 
\q1 But persecuted the poor and needy man, 
\q1 That \add he\add* might even slay the broken in heart. 
\q1
\v 17 As he loved cursing, so let it come \add unto\add* him:

\c 114  
\q1
\v 1 When Israel went out of Egypt, 
\q1 The house of Jacob from a people of strange language; 
\q1
\v 2 Judah was his sanctuary, 
\q1 \add And\add* Israel his dominion. 
\b
\q1
\v 3 The sea saw \add it\add*, and fled: 
\q1 Jordan was driven back. 
\q1
\v 4 The mountains skipped like rams, 
\q1 \add And\add* the little hills like lambs. 
\b
\q1
\v 5 What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? 
\q1 Thou Jordan, \add that\add* thou wast driven back? 
\q1
\v 6 Ye mountains, \add that\add* ye skipped like rams; 
\q1 \add And\add* ye little hills, like lambs? 
\b
\q1
\v 7 Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, 
\q1 At the presence of the God of Jacob; 
\q1
\v 8 Which turned the rock \add into\add* a standing water, 
\q1 The flint into a fountain of waters. 
\c 115  
\q1
\v 1 Not unto us, O \sc Lord\sc*, not unto us, 
\q1 But unto thy name give glory, 
\q1 For thy mercy, \add and\add* for thy truth’s sake. 
\q1
\v 2 Wherefore should the heathen say, 
\q1 Where \add is\add* now their God? 
\b
\q1
\v 3 But our God \add is\add* in the heavens: 
\q1 He hath done whatsoever he pleased. 
\q1
\v 4 Their idols \add are\add* silver and gold, 
\q1 The work of men’s hands. 
\q1
\v 5 They have mouths, but they speak not: 
\q1 Eyes have they, but they see not: 
\q1
\v 6 They have ears, but they hear not: 
\q1 Noses have they, but they smell not: 
\q1
\v 7 They \add have\add* hands, but they handle not: 
\q1 Feet \add have\add* they, but they walk not: 
\q1 Neither speak they through their throat. 
\q1
\v 8 They that make them are like unto them; 
\q1 \add So is\add* every one that trusteth in them. 
\b
\q1
\v 9 O Israel, trust thou in the \sc Lord\sc*: 
\q1 He \add is\add* their help and their shield. 
\q1
\v 10 O house of Aaron, trust in the \sc Lord\sc*: 
\q1 He \add is\add* their help and their shield. 
\q1
\v 11 Ye that fear the \sc Lord\sc*, trust in the \sc Lord\sc*: 
\q1 He \add is\add* their help and their shield. 
\b
\q1
\v 12 The \sc Lord\sc* hath been mindful of us: he will bless \add us;\add* 
\q1 He will bless the house of Israel; 
\q1 He will bless the house of Aaron. 
\q1
\v 13 He will bless them that fear the \sc Lord\sc*, 
\q1 \add Both\add* small and great. 
\q1
\v 14 The \sc Lord\sc* shall increase you more and more, 
\q1 You and your children. 
\q1
\v 15 You \add are\add* blessed of the \sc Lord\sc* 
\q1 Which made heaven and earth. 
\b
\q1
\v 16 The heaven, \add even\add* the heavens, \add are\add* the \sc Lord’s\sc*: 
\q1 But the earth hath he given to the children of men. 
\q1
\v 17 The dead praise not the \sc Lord\sc*, 
\q1 Neither any that go down into silence. 
\q1
\v 18 But we will bless the \sc Lord\sc* 
\q1 From this time forth and for evermore. 
\q1 Praise the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\c 116  
\q1
\v 1 I love the \sc Lord\sc*, because he hath heard 
\q1 My voice \add and\add* my supplications. 
\q1
\v 2 Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, 
\q1 Therefore will I call upon \add him\add* as long as I live. 
\q1
\v 3 The sorrows of death compassed me, 
\q1 And the pains of hell gat hold upon me: 
\q1 I found trouble and sorrow. 
\q1
\v 4 Then called I upon the name of the \sc Lord\sc*; 
\q1 O \sc Lord\sc*, I beseech thee, deliver my soul. 
\q1
\v 5 Gracious \add is\add* the \sc Lord\sc*, and righteous; 
\q1 Yea, our God \add is\add* merciful. 
\q1
\v 6 The \sc Lord\sc* preserveth the simple: 
\q1 I was brought low, and he helped me. 
\q1
\v 7 Return unto thy rest, O my soul; 
\q1 For the \sc Lord\sc* hath dealt bountifully with thee. 
\q1
\v 8 For thou hast delivered my soul from death, 
\q1 Mine eyes from tears, 
\q1 \add And\add* my feet from falling. 
\q1
\v 9 I will walk before the \sc Lord\sc* 
\q1 In the land of the living. 
\q1
\v 10 I believed, therefore have I spoken: 
\q1 I was greatly afflicted: 
\q1
\v 11 I said in my haste, 
\q1 All men \add are\add* liars. 
\b
\q1
\v 12 What shall I render unto the \sc Lord\sc* 
\q1 \add For\add* all his benefits towards me? 
\q1
\v 13 I will take the cup of salvation, 
\q1 And call upon the name of the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\q1
\v 14 I will pay my vows unto the \sc Lord\sc* 
\q1 Now in the presence of all his people. 
\q1
\v 15 Precious in the sight of the \sc Lord\sc* 
\q1 \add Is\add* the death of his saints. 
\q1
\v 16 Oh \sc Lord\sc*, truly I \add am\add* thy servant; 
\q1 I \add am\add* thy servant, \add and\add* the son of thy handmaid: 
\q1 Thou hast loosed my bonds. 
\q1
\v 17 I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, 
\q1 And will call upon the name of the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\q1
\v 18 I will pay my vows unto the \sc Lord\sc* 
\q1 Now in the presence of all his people, 
\q1
\v 19 In the courts of the \sc Lord’s\sc* house, 
\q1 In the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. 
\q1 Praise ye the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\c 117  
\q1
\v 1 O praise the \sc Lord\sc*, all ye nations: 
\q1 Praise him, all ye people. 
\q1
\v 2 For his merciful kindness is great toward us: 
\q1 And the truth of the \sc Lord\sc* \add endureth\add* for ever. 
\q1 Praise ye the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\c 118  
\q1
\v 1 O give thanks unto the \sc Lord\sc*; for \add he is\add* good:

\q1
\v 2 Let Israel now say, 
\q1 That his mercy \add endureth\add* for ever. 
\q1
\v 3 Let the house of Aaron now say, 
\q1 That his mercy \add endureth\add* for ever. 
\q1
\v 4 Let them now that fear the \sc Lord\sc* say, 
\q1 That his mercy \add endureth\add* for ever. 
\q1
\v 5 I called upon the \sc Lord\sc* in distress: 
\q1 The \sc Lord\sc* answered me, \add and set me\add* in a large place. 
\q1
\v 6 The \sc Lord\sc* \add is\add* on my side; I will not fear: 
\q1 What can man do unto me? 
\q1
\v 7 The \sc Lord\sc* taketh my part with them that help me: 
\q1 Therefore shall I see \add my desire\add* upon them that hate me. 
\q1
\v 8  \add It is\add* better to trust in the \sc Lord\sc* 
\q1 Than to put confidence in man. 
\q1
\v 9  \add It is\add* better to trust in the \sc Lord\sc* 
\q1 Than to put confidence in princes. 
\q1
\v 10 All nations compassed me about: 
\q1 But in the name of the \sc Lord\sc* will I destroy them. 
\q1
\v 11 They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: 
\q1 But in the name of the \sc Lord\sc* I will destroy them. 
\q1
\v 12 They compassed me about like bees; 
\q1 They are quenched as the fire of thorns: 
\q1 For in the name of the \sc Lord\sc* I will destroy them. 
\q1
\v 13 Thou hast thrust sore at me that \add I\add* might fall: 
\q1 But the \sc Lord\sc* helped me. 
\q1
\v 14 The \sc Lord\sc* \add is\add* my strength and song, 
\q1 And is become my salvation. 
\q1
\v 15 The voice of rejoicing and salvation \add is\add* in the tabernacles of the righteous:

\q1
\v 16 The right hand of the \sc Lord\sc* is exalted: 
\q1 The right hand of the \sc Lord\sc* doeth valiantly. 
\q1
\v 17 I shall not die, but live, 
\q1 And declare the works of the \sc Lord\sc*. 
\q1
\v 18 The \sc Lord\sc* hath chastened me sore: 
\q1 But he hath not given me over unto death. 
\q1
\v 19 Open to me the gates of righteousness: 
\q1 I will go into them, \add and\add* I will praise the \sc Lord\sc*: 
\q1
\v 20 This gate of the \sc Lord\sc*, 
\q1 Into which the righteous shall enter. 
\q1
\v 21 I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, 
\q1 And art become my salvation. 
\q1
\v 22 The stone \add which\add* the builders refused 
\q1 Is become the head \add stone\add* of the corner. 
\q1
\v 23 This is the \sc Lord’s\sc* doing;

\v 24 This \add is\add* the day \add which\add* the \sc Lord\sc* hath made;
