\v 1 Paul Syluanus and Timotheus. Vnto the congregacion of the Tessalonyans which are in God oure father and in the Lorde Iesus Christ. 
\v 2 Grace be with you and peace from God oure father and from the Lorde Iesus Christ. 
\v 3 We are bounde to thanke God all wayes for you brethren as it is mete because that youre fayth groweth excedyngly and every one of you swymmeth in love towarde another betwene youre selves 
\v 4 so that we oureselves reioyce of you in the congregacions of God over youre pacience and fayth in all youre persecucions and tribulacions that ye suffre 
\v 5 which is a token of the ryghtewes iudgement of god that ye are counted worthy of the kyngdom of god for which ye also suffre. 
\v 6 It is verely a rightewes thinge with God to recopence tribulacion to them that trouble you: 
\v 7 and to you which are troubled rest with vs when the lorde Iesus shall shewe him silfe from heven with his myghty angels 
\v 8 in flammynge fyre rendrynge vengeaunce vnto them that knowe not God and to them that obeye not vnto the gospell of oure Lorde Iesus Christ 
\v 9 which shalbe punysshed with everlastynge damnacion from the presence of the lorde and from the glory of his power 
\v 10 when he shall come to be glorified in his sainctes and to be made marvelous in all them that beleve: because oure testimonye that we had vnto you was beleved even the same daye that we preached it. 
\v 11 Wherfore we praye all wayes for you that oure god make you worthy of the callynge and fulfill all delectacion of goodnes and the worke of fayth with power: 
\v 12 that the name of oure lorde Iesus Christ maye be gloryfied in you and ye in him thorowe the grace of oure God and of the lorde Iesus Christ. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 We beseche you brethren by the commynge of oure lorde Iesu Christ and in that we shall assemble vnto him 
\v 2 that ye be not sodely moved from youre mynde and be not troubled nether by sprete nether by wordes nor yet by letter which shuld seme to come from vs as though the daye of Christ were at honde. 
\v 3 Let no man deceave you by eny meanes for the lorde commeth not excepte ther come a departynge fyrst and that that synfnll man be opened the sonne of perdicion 
\v 4 which is an adversarie and is exalted above all that is called god or that is worshipped: so that he shall sitt as God in temple of god and shew him silfe as god. 
\v 5 Remember ye not that when I was yet with you I tolde you these thynges? 
\v 6 And nowe ye knowe what with holdeth: even that he myght be vttered at his tyme. 
\v 7 For the mistery of that iniquitie doeth he all readie worke which onlie loketh vntill it be taken out of the waye. 
\v 8 And then shall that wicked be vttered whom the lorde shall consume with the sprete of hys mouth and shall destroye with the apearaunce of his commynge 
\v 9 even him whose commynge is by the workynge of Satan wyth all lyinge power signes and wonders: 
\v 10 and in all deceavablenes of vnrightewesnes amonge them that perysshe: because they receaved not the (love) of the truth that they myght have bene saved. 
\v 11 And therfore god shall sende them stronge delusion that they shuld beleve lyes: 
\v 12 that all they myght be damned which beleved not the trueth but had pleasure in vnrightewesnes. 
\v 13 But we are bounde to geve thankes alwaye to god for you brethren beloved of the lorde for because that God hath from the begynnynge chosen you to saluacion thorow sanctifyinge of the sprete and thorowe belevynge the trueth: 
\v 14 whervnto he called you byoure gospell to obtayne the glorye that cometh of oure lord Iesu Christ. 
\v 15 Therfore brethren stonde fast and kepe the ordinaunces which ye have learned: whether it were by oure preachynge or by pistle. 
\v 16 Oure lorde Iesu Christ hym silfe and God oure father which hath loved vs and hath geven vs everlastynge consolacion and good hope thorowe grace 
\v 17 comforte youre hertes and stablysshe you in all doctrine and good doynge. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 Furthermore brethren praye for vs that the worde of god maye have fre passage and be gloryfied as it is with you: 
\v 2 and that we maye be delivered from vnresonable and evyll men. For all men have not fayth: 
\v 3 but the lorde is faythfull which shall stablysshe you and kepe you from evyll. 
\v 4 We have confidence thorow the lorde to you warde that ye both do and will do that which we commaude you. 
\v 5 And the lorde gyde youre hertes vnto the love of God and paciece of Christ. 
\v 6 We requyre you brethren in the name of oure lorde Iesu Christ that ye with drawe youre selves from every brother that walketh inordinatly and not after the institucion which ye receaved of vs. 
\v 7 Ye youre selves knowe how ye ought to folowe vs. For we behaved not oure selves inordinatly amonge you. 
\v 8 Nether toke we breed of eny man for nought: but wrought with laboure and travayle nyght and daye because we wolde not be grevous to eny of you: 
\v 9 not but that we had auctoritie: but to make oure selves an insample vnto you to folowe vs. 
\v 10 For when we were with you this we warned you of that yf ther were eny which wolde not worke that the same shuld not eate. 
\v 11 We have hearde saye no doute that ther are some which walke amonge you inordinatly and worke not at all but are besy bodies. 
\v 12 Them that are soche we commaunde and exhorte by oure lorde Iesu Christ that they worke with quyetnes and eate their awne breed. 
\v 13 Brethren be not wery in well doynge. 
\v 14 Yf eny man obey not oure sayinges sende vs worde of him by a letter: and have no companie with him that he maye be ashamed. 
\v 15 And count him not as an enemy: but warne him as a brother. 
\v 16 The very lorde of peace geve you peace all wayes by all meanes. The lorde be with you all. 
\v 17 The salutacion of me Paul with myne awne honde. This is the token in all pistles. So I write. 
\v 18 The grace of oure lorde Iesus Christ be with you all Amen. ‘Sent from Athens.’
