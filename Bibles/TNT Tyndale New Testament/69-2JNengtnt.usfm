\v 1 The elder to the electe lady and her chyldren which I love in the trueth: and not I only but also all that have knowe the trueth 
\v 2 for the truthes sake which dwelleth in vs and shalbe in vs for ever. 
\v 3 With you be grace mercy and peace from God the father and from the Lorde Iesus Christ the sonne of the father in trueth and love. 
\v 4 I reioysed greatly that I founde of thy chyldre walkinge in trouth as we have receaved a commaundement of the father. 
\v 5 And nowe beseche I the lady not as though I wrote a newe commaundement vnto the but that same which we had from the begynninge that we shuld love one another. 
\v 6 And this is the love that we shulde walke after his commaundementes. This commaundement is (that as ye have hearde from the begynninge) ye shuld walke in it. 
\v 7 For many deceavers are entred in to the worlde which confesse not that Iesus Christ is come in the flesshe. This is a deceaver and an Antichrist. 
\v 8 Loke on youre selves that we loose not that we have wrought: but that we maye have a full rewarde. 
\v 9 Whosoever transgresseth and bydeth not in the doctrine of Christ hath not God. He that endureth in the doctrine of Christ hath bothe the father and the sonne. 
\v 10 Yf ther come eny vnto you and bringe not this learninge him receave not to housse: nether bid him God spede. 
\v 11 For he that biddeth him God spede is parttaker of his evyll dedes. 
\v 12 I had many thinges to wryte vnto you neverthelesse I wolde not wryte with paper and ynke: but I trust to come vnto you and speake with you mouth to mouth that oure ioye maye be full. 
\v 13 The sonnes of thy electe syster grete the. Amen.
