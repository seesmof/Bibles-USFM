\v 1 Paul Syluanus and Timotheus. Vnto the congregacion of the Tessalonyans in God the father and in the Lorde Iesus Christ. Grace be with you and peace from God oure father and from the Lorde Iesus Christ. 
\v 2 We geve God thakes all waye for you all makinge mension of you in oure prayers 
\v 3 with out ceasynge and call to remembraunce youre worke in the faythe and labour in love and perseveraunce in the hope of oure lorde Iesus Christ in the sight of God oure father: 
\v 4 because we knowe brethren beloved of god how that ye are electe. 
\v 5 For oure gospell came not vnto you in worde only but also in power and also in the holy gost and in moche certayntie as ye knowe after what maner we behaued oure selves amonge you for youre sakes. 
\v 6 And ye became folowers of vs and of the lord and receaved the worde in moche affliccion with ioye of the holy gost: 
\v 7 so that ye were an ensample to all that beleve in Macedonia and Achaia. 
\v 8 For from you sounded out the worde of the lorde not in Macedonia and in Achaia only: but youre fayth also which ye have vnto god spred her silfe abroade in all quartars so greatly that it nedeth not vs to speake eny thynge at all. 
\v 9 For they the selves shewe of you what maner of entrynge in we had vnto you and how ye tourned to God from ymages for to serve the livynge and true god 
\v 10 and for to loke for his sonne from heven whom he raysed from deeth: I mean Iesus which delivereth vs from wrath to come. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 For ye youre selves knowe brethren of oure entraunce in vnto you howe that it was not in vayne: 
\v 2 but even after that we had suffered before and were shamfully entreated at Phillippos (as ye well knowe) then were we bolde in oure God to speake vnto you the gospell of God with moche strivynge. 
\v 3 Oure exhortacion was not to brynge you to erroure nor yet to vnclennes nether was it with gyle: 
\v 4 but as we were alowed of God that the gospell shuld be committed vnto vs: even so we speake not as though we entended to please men but God which trieth oure hertes. 
\v 5 Nether was oure conversacion at eny tyme with flatterynge wordes as ye well knowe nether in cloked coveteousnes God is recorde: 
\v 6 nether sought we prayse of men nether of you nor yet of eny other when we myght have bene chargeable as the apostles of Christ 
\v 7 but we were tender amonge you even as a norsse cheressheth her children 
\v 8 so was oure affeccion towarde you oure good will was to have dealte vnto you not the gospell of God only: but also oure awne soules because ye were deare vnto vs. 
\v 9 Ye remember brethren oure laboure and travayle. For we laboured daye and nyght because we wolde not be greveous vnto eny of you and preached vnto you the gospell of God. 
\v 10 Ye are witnesses and so is god how holyly and iustly and vnblameable we behaved oure selves amonge you that beleve: 
\v 11 as ye knowe how that we exhorted and comforted and besought every one of you as a father his children 
\v 12 that ye wolde walke worthy of God which hath called you vnto his kyngdome and glory. 
\v 13 For this cause thanke we god with out ceasynge because that when ye receaved of vs the worde wherwith God was preached ye receaved it not as the worde of man: but even as it was in dede the worde of God which worketh in you that beleve. 
\v 14 For ye brethren became folowers of the congregacions of god which in Iewry are in Christ Iesu: for ye have suffered lyke thynges of youre kynsmen as we oure selves have suffered of the Iewes. 
\v 15 Which as they kylled the lorde Iesus and their awne prophetes even so have they persecuted vs and God they please not and are contrary to all men 
\v 16 and forbid vs to preache vnto the gentyls that they myght be saved to fulfill their synnes all waye. For the wrath of God is come on them even to the vtmost. 
\v 17 For as moch brethren as we are kept from you for a season as concernynge the bodyly presence but not in the herte we enforsed the more to se you personally with great desire. 
\v 18 And therfore we wolde have come vnto you I paul once and agayne: but Satan with stode vs. 
\v 19 For what is oure hope or ioye or croune of reioysynge? are not ye it in the presence of oure lorde Iesus Christ at his comynge? 
\v 20 yes ye are oure glory and ioye. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 Wherfore sence we coulde no lenger forbeare it pleased vs to remayne at Athens alone 
\v 2 and sent Timotheus oure brother and minister of god and oure laboure felowe in the gospell of Christ to stablysshe you and to comforte you over youre fayth 
\v 3 that no man shulde be moved in these affliccions. For ye youre selves knowe that we are even apoynted therevnto. 
\v 4 For verely when I was with you I tolde you before that we shulde suffre tribulacion even as it came to passe and as ye knowe. 
\v 5 For this cause when I coulde no lenger forbeare I sent that I myght have knowledge of youre fayth lest haply the tempter had tempted you and that oure laboure had bene bestowed in vayne. 
\v 6 But now lately when Timotheus came from you vnto vs and declared to vs youre fayth and youre love and how that ye have good remembraunce of vs all wayes desyringe to se vs as we desyre to se you. 
\v 7 Therfore brethren we had consolacion in you in all oure adversite and necessite through youre fayth. 
\v 8 For now are we alyve yf ye stonde stedfast in the lorde. 
\v 9 For what thankes can we recompence to god agayne for you over all the ioye that we ioye for youre sakes before oure god 
\v 10 whyle we nyght and daye praye excedingly that we myght se you presently and myght fulfill that wich is lackynge in youre fayth. 
\v 11 God him silfe oure father and oure lorde Iesus Christ gyde oure iorney vnto you: 
\v 12 and the lorde increace you and make you flowe ouer in love one towarde another and towarde all men even as we do towarde you 
\v 13 to make youre hertes stable and vnblameable in holynes before God oure father at the commynge of oure Lorde Iesus Christ with all his sainctes. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 Further more we beseche you brethren and exhorte you in the lorde Iesus that ye increace more and more euen as ye have receaved of vs how ye ought to walke and to please god. 
\v 2 Ye remember what commaundmentes we gave you in oure lorde Iesu Christ. 
\v 3 For this is the will of god even that ye shuld be holy 
\v 4 and that ye shuld abstayne from fornicacion that every one of you shuld knowe how to kepe his vessell in holynes and honoure 
\v 5 and not in the lust of concupiscence as do the hethen which knowe not god 
\v 6 that noman goo to farre and defraude his brother in bargayninge: because the lorde is a venger of all suche thinges as we tolde you before tyme and testified. 
\v 7 For god hath not called vs vnto vnclennes: but vnto holynes. 
\v 8 He therfore that despiseth despiseth not man but God which hath sent his holy sprete amonge you. 
\v 9 But as touchynge brotherly love ye nede not that I wryte vnto you. For ye are taught of God to love on another. 
\v 10 Ye and that thinge verely ye do vnto all the brethren which are thorow oute all Macedonia. We beseche you brethren that ye encreace more and more 
\v 11 and that ye studye to be quyet and to medle with youre awne busynes and to worke with youre awne hondes as we commaunded you: 
\v 12 that ye maye behave youre selves honestly towarde them that are with out and that nothinge be lackynge vnto you. 
\v 13 I wolde not brethren have you ignoraunt concerninge them which are fallen aslepe that ye sorowe not as other do which have no hope. 
\v 14 For yf we beleve that Iesus dyed and rose agayne: even so them also which slepe by IeIesus will God brynge agayne with him. 
\v 15 And this saye we vnto you in the worde of the Lorde that we which live and are remayninge in the comminge of the Lorde shall not come yerre they which slepe. 
\v 16 For the Lorde him selfe shall descende from heven with a showte and the voyce of the archangell and trompe of God. And the deed in Christe shall aryse fyrst: 
\v 17 then shall we which live and remayne be caught vp with them also in the cloudes to mete the Lorde in the ayer. And so shall we ever be with the Lorde. 
\v 18 Wherfore comforte youre selves one another with these wordes 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 Of the tymes and seasons brethren ye have no nede that I write vnto you: 
\v 2 for ye youre selves knowe parfectly that the daye of the Lorde shall come even as a thefe in the nyght. 
\v 3 When they shall saye peace and no daunger than commeth on the soden destruccion as the travalynge of a woman with childe and they shall not scape. 
\v 4 But ye brethren are not in darcknes that that daye shuld come on you as it were a thefe. 
\v 5 Ye are all the children of light and the children of the daye. We are not of the nyght nether of darcknes. 
\v 6 Therfore let vs not slepe as do other: but let vs watch and be sober. 
\v 7 For they that slepe slepe in the nyght: and they that be dronken are dronken in the nyght. 
\v 8 But let vs which are of the daye be sober armed with the brest plate of fayth and love and with hope of salvacion as an helmet. 
\v 9 For god hath not apoynted vs vnto wrath: but to obtayne salvacion by the meanes of oure lorde Iesu Christ 
\v 10 which died for vs: that whether we wake or slepe we shuld lyve togedder with him. 
\v 11 Wherfore comforte youre selves togedder and edifie one another even as ye do. 
\v 12 We beseche you brethren that ye knowe them which laboure amonge you and have the oversight of you in the Lorde and geve you exhortacion 
\v 13 that ye have them the more in love for their workes sake and be at peace with them. 
\v 14 We desyre you brethren warne them that are vnruly comforte the feble mynded forbeare the weake have continuall pacience towarde all men. 
\v 15 Se that none recopence evill for evyll vnto eny man: but ever folowe that which is good both amonge youre selves and to all men. 
\v 16 Reioyce ever. 
\v 17 Praye continually. 
\v 18 In all thinges geve thankes. For this is the wyll of God in Christ Iesu towarde you. 
\v 19 Quenche not the sprete. 
\v 20 Despise not prophesyinge. 
\v 21 Examen all thinges and kepe that which is good. 
\v 22 Abstayne from all suspicious thinges. 
\v 23 The very God of peace sanctifie you thorow out. And I praye God that youre whole sprete soulse and body be kept fautlesse vnto the comynge of oure Lorde Iesus Christ 
\v 24 Faythfull is he which called you: which will also do it. 
\v 25 Brethren praye for vs. 
\v 26 Grete all the brethren with an holy kysse. 
\v 27 I charge you in the Lorde that this pistle be reed vnto all the holy brethren. 
\v 28 The grace of the Lorde Iesus Christ be with you. Amen. ‘The fyrst pistle vnto the Tessalonyans sent from Athens.’
