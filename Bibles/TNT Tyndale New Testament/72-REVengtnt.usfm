\p
\v 1 The reuelacion of Iesus Christe which god gave vnto him for to shewe vnto his servauntes thinges which muste shortly come to passe. And he sent and shewed by his angell vnto his servaunt Ihon 
\v 2 which bare recorde of the worde of god and of the testimony of Iesus Christe and of all thinges that he sawe. 
\v 3 Happy is he that redith and they that heare the wordes of the prophesy and kepe thoo thinges which are written therin. For the tyme is at honde. 
\v 4 Ihon to the .vii. congregacions in Asia. Grace be with you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the .vii. spretes which are present before his trone 
\v 5 and from Iesus Christ which is a faythfull witnes and fyrst begotte of the deed: and Lorde over the kinges of the erth. Vnto him that loved vs and wesshed vs from synnes in his awne bloud 
\v 6 and made vs kinges and Prestes vnto God his father be glory and dominion for ever more. Amen. 
\v 7 Beholde he commeth with cloudes and all eyes shall se him: and they also which peersed him. And all kinredes of the erth shall wayle. Even so. Amen. 
\v 8 I am Alpha and Omega the begynninge and the endinge sayth the Lorde almyghty which is and which was and which is to come. 
\v 9 I Ihon youre brother and companyon in tribulacion and in the kyngdom and pacience which is in Iesu Christe was in the yle of Pathmos for the worde of god and for the witnessynge of Iesu Christe. 
\v 10 I was in the sprete on a sondaye and herde behynde me a gret voyce as it had bene of a trompe 
\v 11 sayinge: I am Alpha and Omega the fyrst and the laste. That thou seist write in a boke and sende it vnto the congregacions which are in Asia vnto Ephesus and vnto Smyrna and vnto Pargamos and vnto Thiatira and vnto Sardis and vnto Philadelphia and vnto Laodicia. 
\v 12 And I turned backe to se the voyce that spake to me. And when I was turned: I sawe .vii golde candelstyckes 
\v 13 and in the myddes of the candelstyckes one lyke vnto the sone of man clothed with a lynnen garmet doune to the ground and gyrd aboute the pappes with a golden gyrdle 
\v 14 His heed and his heares were whyte as whyte woll and as snowe: and his eyes were as a flame of fyre: 
\v 15 and his fete lyke vnto brasse as though they brent in a fornace: and his voyce as the sounde of many waters. 
\v 16 And he had in his right honde vii. starres. And out of his mouth wet a sharpe twoo edged swearde. And his face shone even as the sonne in his strength. 
\v 17 And when I sawe him I fell at his fete even as deed. And he layde hys ryght honde apon me sayinge vnto me: feare not. I am the fyrst and the laste 
\v 18 and am alyve and was deed. And beholde I am alyve for ever more and have the kayes of hell and of deeth. 
\v 19 wryte therfore the thynges which thou haste sene and the thynges which are and the thynges which shalbe fulfylled hereafter: 
\v 20 and the mystery of the vii. starres which thou sawest in my ryght honde and the vii. golden candelstyckes. The vii. stares are the messengers of the vii. congregacions: And the vii. candlestyckes which thou sawest are the vii. congregacions. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 Unto the messenger of the congregacion of Ephesus wryte: These thynges sayth he that holdeth the vii. starres in his right honde and walketh in the myddes of the vii. golden candlestyckes. 
\v 2 I knowe thy workes and thy labour and thy pacience and howe thou cannest not forbeare the which are evyll: and examinedst them which saye they are Apostles and are not: and hast founde them lyars 
\v 3 and dydest wasshe thy self. And hast pacience: and for my names sake hast labored and hast not faynted. 
\v 4 Neverthelesse I have sumwhat agaynst the for thou haste lefte thy fyrst love. 
\v 5 Remember therfore from whence thou art fallen and repent and do the fyrst workes. Or elles I wyll come vnto the shortly and will remove thy candlestyke out of his place excepte thou repent. 
\v 6 But this thou haste because thou hatest the dedes of the Nicolaitans which dedes I also hate. 
\v 7 Lett him that hath eares heare what the sprete sayth vnto the congregacions. To him that overcometh will I geve to eate of the tree of lyfe which is in the myddes of the paradice of god. 
\v 8 And vnto the angell of the congregacion of Smyrna wryte: These thynges sayth he that is fyrst and the laste which was deed and is alive. 
\v 9 I knowe thy workes and tribulacion and poverte but thou art ryche: And I knowe the blaspemy of them whiche call them selves Iewes and are not: but are the congregacion of sathan. 
\v 10 Feare none of thoo thynges which thou shalt soffre. Beholde the devyll shall caste of you into preson to tempte you and ye shall have tribulacion .x. dayes. Be faythfull vnto the deeth and I will geve the a croune of lyfe. 
\v 11 Let him that hath ears heare what the sprete sayth to the congregacions: He that overcometh shall not be hurte of the seconde deeth. 
\v 12 And to the messenger of the congregacion in Pergamos wryte: This sayth he which hath the sharpe swearde with two edges. 
\v 13 I knowe thy workes and where thow dwellest evyn where Sathans seat ys and thou kepest my name and hast not denyed my fayth. And in my dayes Antipas was a faythfull witnes of myne which was slayne amonge you where sathan dwelleth. 
\v 14 But I have a fewe thynges agaynst the: that thou hast there they that mayntayne the doctryne of Balam which taught in balake to put occasion of syn before the chylderne of Israhell that they shulde eate of meate dedicat vnto ydoles and to commyt fornicacion. 
\v 15 Even so hast thou them that mayntayne the doctryne of the Nicolaytans which thynge I hate. 
\v 16 But be converted or elles I will come vnto the shortly and will fyght agaynste the with thes wearde of my mouth 
\v 17 Lett him that hath eares heare what the sprete sayth vnto the congregacions: To him that overcommeth will I geve to eate manna that is hyd and will geve him a whyte stone and in the stone a newe name wrytten which no man knoweth savinge he that receaveth it. 
\v 18 And vnto the messenger of the congregacion of Theatira write: This sayth the sonne of god which hath his eyes lyke vnto a flame of fyre whose fete are like brasse: 
\v 19 I knowe thy workes and thy love service and fayth and thy paciece and thy dedes which are mo at the last then at the fyrste. 
\v 20 Notwitstondinge I have a feawe thynges agaynst the that thou sofferest that woman Iesabell which called her sylfe a prophetes to teache and to deceave my servauntes to make them commyt fornicacion and to eate meates offered vppe vnto ydoles. 
\v 21 And I gave her space to repent of her fornicacion and she repented not. 
\v 22 Beholde I will caste her into a beed and them that commyt fornicacion with her into gret adversite excepte they tourne from their deades. 
\v 23 And I will kyll her children with deeth. And all the congregacions shall knowe that I am he which searcheth the reynes and hertes. And I will geve vnto evere one of you accordynge vnto youre workes. 
\v 24 Vnto you I saye and vnto other of them of Thiatyra as many as have not this lerninge and which have not knowen the depnes of Sathan (as they saye) I will put apon you none other burthe 
\v 25 but that which ye have alreddy. Holde fast tyll I come 
\v 26 and whosoever overcometh and kepeth my workes vnto the ende to hym will I geve power over nacions 
\v 27 and he shall rule them with a rodde of yron: and as the vessels of a potter shall he breake them to shevers. Even as I receaved of my father 
\v 28 euen so will I geve him the mornynge starre. 
\v 29 Let him that hath eares heare what the sprete sayth to the congregacions. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 And wryte vnto the messenger of the congregacion of Sardis: this sayth he that hath the sprete of god and the vii. starres. I knowe thy workes thou haste a name that thou lvyest and thou art deed. 
\v 2 Be awake and strength the thynges which remayne that are redy to dye. For I have not founde thy workes perfaycte before god. 
\v 3 Remember therfore how thou hast receaved and hearde and hold faste and repet. Yf thou shalt not watche I will come on ye as a thefe and thou shalt not knowe what houre I wyll come apon the 
\v 4 Thou haste a feawe names in Sardis which have not defyled their garmentes: and they shall walke with me in whyte for they are worthy 
\v 5 He that overcometh shalbe clothed in whyte araye and I will not put out his name out of the boke of lyfe and I will confesse his name before my father and before his angelles. 
\v 6 Let him that hath eares heare what the sprete sayth vnto the congregacions. 
\v 7 And wryte vnto the tydinges bringer of the congregacion of Philadelphia: this sayth he that is holy and true which hath the keye of Dauid: which openyth and noma shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth. 
\v 8 I knowe thy workes. Beholde I have set before the an open doore and no man can shut it for thou haste a lyttell strengthe and haste kept my sayinges: and haste not denyed my name. 
\v 9 Beholde I make them of the congregacion of Sathan which call them selves Iewes and are not but do lye: Beholde: I will make them that they shall come and worshippe before thy fete: and shall knowe that I love the. 
\v 10 Because thou hast kept the wordes of my paciece therfore I will kepe the from the houre of temptacion which will come upo all the worlde to tempte them that dwell vpon the erth. 
\v 11 Beholde I come shortly. Holde that which thou haste that no man take awaye thy croune. 
\v 12 Him that overcometh will I make a pyllar in the temple of my God and he shall goo no more oute. And I will wryt vpo him the name of my God and the name of the cite of my god newe Ierusalem which cometh doune oute of heven from my God and I will wryte vpon him my newe name. 
\v 13 Let him that hath eares heare what the sprete sayth vnto the congregacions. 
\v 14 And vnto the messenger of the congregacion which is in Laodicia wryte: This sayth (amen) the faythfull and true witnes the begynninge of the creatures of God. 
\v 15 I knowe thy workes that thou arte nether colde nor hot: I wolde thou were colde or hotte. 
\v 16 So then because thou arte bitwene bothe and nether colde ner hot I will spew the oute of my mouth: 
\v 17 because thou sayst thou arte riche and incresyd with goodes and haste nede of nothynge and knowest not howe thou arte wretched and miserable poore blinde and nakyd. 
\v 18 I counsell the to bye of me golde tryed in the fyre that thou mayste be riche and whyte raymet that thou mayste be clothed that thy fylthy nakednes do not apere: and anoynt thyne eyes with eye salve that thou mayste se. 
\v 19 As many as I love I rebuke and chasten. Be fervent therfore and repent. 
\v 20 Beholde I stode at the doore and knocke. Yf eny man heare my voyce and opon the dore I will come in vnto him and will suppe with him and he with me. 
\v 21 To him that overcommeth will I graunte to sytt with me in my seate evyn as I overcam and have sytten with my father in his seate. 
\v 22 Lett him that hath eares heare what the sprete sayth vnto the congregacions. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 After this I loked and beholde a dore was open in heven and the fyrste voyce which I harde was as it were of a trompet talkinge with me which said: come vp hydder and I will shewe the thynges which must be fulfyllyd hereafter. 
\v 2 And immediatly I was in the sprete: and beholde a seate was put in heven and one sate on the seate. 
\v 3 And he that sat was to loke apon like vnto a iaspar stone and a sardyne stone: And there was a rayne bowe aboute the seate in syght lyke to an Emeralde. 
\v 4 And aboute the seate were .xxiiii. seates. And upon the seates .xxiiii. elders syttinge clothed in whyte rayment and had on their heddes crounes of gold. 
\v 5 And out of the seate proceded lightnynges and thundrynges and voyces and there wer vii. lampes of fyre burninge before the seate which are the vii. sprettes of God. 
\v 6 And before the seate there was a see of glasse lyke vnto cristall and in the myddes of the seate and rounde aboute the seate were iiii. bestes full of eyes before and behynde. 
\v 7 And the fyrste best was lyke a lion the seconde best lyke a calfe and the thyrde beste had a face as a man and the fourthe beste was like a flyinge egle. 
\v 8 And the iiii. bestes had eche one of them vi. wynges aboute him and they were full of eyes with in. And they had noo reste daye nether nyght sayinge: holy holy holy lorde god almyghty which was and is and is to come. 
\v 9 And when those beestes gave glory and honour and thankes to him that sat on the seate which lyveth for ever and ever: 
\v 10 the xxiiii. elders fell doune before him that sat on the trone and worshipped him that lyveth for ever and caste their crounes before the trone sayinge: 
\v 11 thou arte worthy lorde to receave glory and honoure and power for thou haste created all thinges and for thy wylles sake they are and were created. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 And I sawe in the right honde of him that sat in the trone a boke written with in and on the backside sealyd with vii. seales. 
\v 2 And I sawe a stronge angell which cryed with a loude voyce: Who is worthy to open the boke and to loose the seales ther of. 
\v 3 And no man in heven ner in erth nether vnder the erth was able to open the boke nether to loke thereon. 
\v 4 And I wepte moche because no man was founde worthy to open and to rede the boke nether to loke thereon. 
\v 5 And one of the elders sayde unto me: wepe not: Beholde a lion beinge of the tribe of Iuda the rote of Dauid hath obtayned to open the boke and to lose the vii. seales ther of. 
\v 6 And I behelde and loo in the myddes of the seate and of the .iiii. bestes and in the myddes of the elders stode a lambe as though he had bene kylled which had vii. hornes and vii. eyes which are the spretes of God sent into all the worlde. 
\v 7 And he cam and toke the boke oute of the right honde of him that sate apon the seate. 
\v 8 And when he had take the boke the .iiii. bestes and xxiiii. elders fell doune before the labe havynge harpes and golden vialles full of odoures which are the prayers of saynctes 
\v 9 and they songe a newe songe saynge: thou art worthy to take the boke and to open the seales therof: for thou waste kylled and haste redemed vs by thy bloud out of all kynreddes and tonges and people and nacions 
\v 10 and haste made vs vnto oure god kynges and prestes and we shall raygne on the erth. 
\v 11 And I behelde and I herd the voyce of many angylles aboute the trone and about the bestes and the elders and I herde thousand thousandes 
\v 12 saynge with a lowde voyce: Worthy is the lambe that was killed to receave power and riches and wisdom and strenghte and honoure and glory and blyssynge. 
\v 13 And all creatures which are in heven and on the erth and vnder the erth and in the see and all that are in them herd I sayinge: blyssinge honour glory and power be vnto hym that sytteth apon the seate and vnto the lambe for ever more. 
\v 14 And the .iiii. bestes sayd: Amen. And the .xxiiii. elders fell apon their faces and worshypped him that lyveth for ever more. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1 And I sawe when the lambe openyd one of the seales and I herde one of the iiii. bestes saye as it were the noyse of thonder come and se. 
\v 2 And I sawe and beholde there was a whyte horsse and he that sat on him had a bowe and a croune was gevyn vnto him and he went forth conqueringe and forto overcome. 
\v 3 And when he opened the seconde seale I herde the seconde beste saye: come and se. 
\v 4 And there went out another horsse that was red and power was geven to him that satte thereon to take peace from the erth and that they shulde kyll one another. And there was geven vnto him a gret swearde. 
\v 5 And when he opened the thyrde seale I herde the thyrde beste saye: come and se. And I behelde and loo a blacke hors: and he that sate on him had a payre of balances in his honde. 
\v 6 And I herd a voyce in the myddes of the .iiii. bestes saye: a measure of whete for a peny and iii. measures of barly for a peny: and oyle and wyne se thou hurte not. 
\v 7 And when he opened the fourthe seale I herde the voyce of the fourthe beste saye: come and se. 
\v 8 And I loked and beholde a grene horsse and his name that sat on him was deeth and hell folowed after him and power was geven vnto them over the fourthe parte of the erth to kyll with swearde and with honger and with deeth that cometh of vermen of the erth. 
\v 9 And when he opened the fyfte seale I sawe vnder the aultre the soules of them that were kylled for the worde of God and for the testymony which they had 
\v 10 and they cryed with a lowde voyce sayinge: How loge tariest thou lorde holy and true to iudge and to avenge oure bloud on them that dwell on the erth? 
\v 11 And longe whyte garmentes were geven vnto every one of them. And it was sayde vnto them that they shulde reste for a lyttle season vntyll the nomber of their felowes and brethren and of them that shulde be kylled as they were were fulfylled. 
\v 12 And I behelde when he opened the sixte seale and loo there was a grett erth quake and the sunne was as blacke as sacke clothe made of heare. And the mone wexed even as bloud: 
\v 13 and the starres of heven fell vnto the erth even as a fygge tree castith from her her fygges when she is shaken of a myghty wynde. 
\v 14 And heven vanysshed awaye as a scroll when it is rolled togedder. And all mountayns and yles were moved oute of their places. 
\v 15 And the kynges of the erth and the gret men and the ryche men and the chefe captaynes and the myghty men and every bond man and every free man hyd them selves in dennes and in rockes of the hylles 
\v 16 and sayde to the hylles and rockes: fall on vs and hyde vs from the presence of him that sytteth on the seate and from the wrath of the lambe 
\v 17 for the grete daye of hys wrath ys come And who can endure it. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1 And after that I sawe .iiii. angels stonde on the iiii. corners of the erth holdynge the iiii. wyndes of the erth that the wyndes shulde not blowe on the erthe nether on the see nether on eny tree. 
\v 2 And I sawe another angell ascende from the rysynge of the sunne: which had the seale of the lyvynge god and he cryed with a loude voyce to the iiii angelles (to whom power was geven to hurt the erth and the see) 
\v 3 saying: Hurt not the erth nether the see nether the trees tyll we have sealed the servauntes of oure god in their forheddes. 
\v 4 And I herde the nombre of them which were sealed and there were sealed an C. and xliiii. M. 
\v 5 of all the trybes of the chyldren of Israhell. Of the trybe of Iuda were sealed xii.M Of the trybe of Ruben were sealed xii.M. of the trybe of Gad were sealed xii.M. 
\v 6 Of the trybe of Asser were sealed xii.M. Of the trybe of Neptalym were sealed xii.M. Of the trybe of Manasses were sealed xii.M. 
\v 7 Of the trybe of Symeon were sealed xii.M. Of the tribe of Leuy were sealed xii.M. Of the trybe of Isacar were sealed xii.M. 
\v 8 Of the trybe of zabulon were sealed xii.M. Of the tribe of Ioseph were sealed xii.M. Of the trybe of Beniamin were sealed xii. thowsande. 
\v 9 After this I behelde and lo a gret multitude (which noman coulde nombre) of all nacions and people and tonges stode before the seate and before the lambe clothed with longe whyte garmentes and palmes in there hondes 
\v 10 and cryed with a lowde voyce sayinge: salvacion be asscribed to him that syttith apon the seate of oure god and vnto the lambe. 
\v 11 And all the angelles stode in the compase of the seate and of the elders and of the iiii. bestes and fel before the seat on their faces and worshipped god 
\v 12 sayinge amen: Blessynge and glory wisdome and thankes and honour and power and myght be vnto oure god for evermore Amen. 
\v 13 And one of the elders answered sayinge vnto me: what are these which are arayed in longe whyte garmentes and whence cam they? 
\v 14 And I sayde vnto him: lorde thou wottest. And he sayde vnto me: these are they which cam oute of gret tribulacion and made their garmetes large and made them whyte in the bloud of the lambe: 
\v 15 therfore are they in the presence of the seate of God and serve him daye and nyght in hys temple and he that sytteth in the seate wyll dwell amonge them. 
\v 16 They shalt honger no more nether thyrst nether shall the sunne lyght on them nether eny heate: 
\v 17 For the lambe which ys in the myddes of the seate shall fede them and shall ledde them vnto fountaynes of lyuynge water and god shall wype awaye all teares from their eyes. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1 And when he had opened the seventh seale there was silence in heven aboute the space of halfe an houre. 
\v 2 And I sawe angelles stondynge before god and to them were geven vii. trompettes. 
\v 3 And another angell cam and stode before the aultre havynge a golden senser and moche of odoures was geven vnto him that he shulde offre of the prayers of all saynctes apon the golden aultre which was before the seate. 
\v 4 And the smoke of the odoures which came of the prayers of all saynctes ascended vppe before god out of the angelles honde. 
\v 5 And the angell toke the senser and fylled it with fyre of the aultre and caste it into the erth and voyces were made and thondrynges and lightnynges and erthquake. 
\v 6 And the .vii. angells which had the .vii. tropettes prepared them selves to blowe. 
\v 7 The fyrst angell blewe and there was made hayle and fyre which were myngled with bloud and they were caste into the erth: and the thryd parte of trees was burnt and all grene grasse was brent. 
\v 8 And the seconde angell blewe: and as it were a gret mountayne: burnynge with fyre was caste in to the see 
\v 9 and the thyrde parte of the see tourned to bloud and the thyrde parte of the creatures which had lyfe dyed and the thyrde part of shippes were destroyed. 
\v 10 And the thyrde angell blewe and ther fell a grett starre from heven burnynge as it were a lampe and it fell into the thyrde parte of the ryvers and into fountaynes of waters 
\v 11 and the name of the starre is called wormwod. And the thyrde part was turned to wormwod. And many me dyed of the waters because they were made bytter. 
\v 12 And the fourth angell blew and the thyrde parte of the sunne was smytten and the thyrde parte of the mone and the thyrde part of starres: so that the thyrde parte of them was darckned. And the daye was smytten that the thyrde part of it shulde not shyne and lyke wyse the nyght. 
\v 13 And I behelde and herd an angell flyinge thorowe the myddes of heven sayinge with a lowde voyce: Woo wo to the inhabiters of the erth because of the voyces to come of the trompe of the .iii. angells which were yet to blowe. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 And the fyfte angell blewe and I sawe a stare fall from heven vnto the erth. And to him was geven the kaye of the bottomlesse pytt. 
\v 2 And he opened the botomlesse pytt and there arose the smoke of a grett fornace. And the sunne and the ayer were darkned by the reason of the smoke of the pytt. 
\v 3 And there cam out of the smoke locustes vpon the erth: and vnto them was geve power as the scorpions of the erth have power. 
\v 4 And it hurt the grasse of the erth: nether eny grene thinge: nether eny tree: but only those me which have not the seale in their forhedes 
\v 5 and to the was commaunded that they shulde not kyll them but that they shulde be vexed v monethes and their payne was as the payne that cometh of a scorpion when he hath stoge a man. 
\v 6 And in those dayes shall men seke deeth and shall not fynde it and shall desyre to dye and deeth shall flye from them. 
\v 7 And the similitude of the locustes was lyke vnto horses prepared vnto battayll and on their heddes were as it were crownes lyke vnto golde: and their faces were as it had bene the faces of men. 
\v 8 And they had heare as the heare of wemen. And their tethe were as the tethe of lyons. 
\v 9 And they had habbergions as it were habbergions of yron. And the sounde of their wynges was as the sounde of charettes when many horsses runne to gedder to battayle. 
\v 10 And they had tayles lyke vnto scorpions and there were stinges in their tayles. And their power was to hurt men v. monethes. 
\v 11 And they had a kynge over them which is the angell of the bottomlesse pytt whose name in the hebrew tonge is Abadon: but in the greke tonge Apollion. 
\v 12 One woo is past and beholde two wooes come after this. 
\v 13 And the sixte. angell blewe and I herd a voyce from the iiii. corners of the golden aultre which is before god 
\v 14 saying to the sixte angell which had the trompe: Loose the iiii. angelles which are bounde in the grett ryver Eufrates. 
\v 15 And the iiii. angelles were loosed which wer prepared for an houre for a daye for a moneth and for a yeare for to slee the thyrde part of men. 
\v 16 And the nombre of horsme of warre were twenty tymes xM. And I herde the nobre of them. 
\v 17 And thus I sawe the horses in a vision and them that sate on the havynge fyry habbergions of a Iacyncte coloure and brymstony and the heeddes of the horses werre as the heeddes of lyons. And out of their mouthes went forth fyre and smoke and brymstone. 
\v 18 And of these iii. was the thyrde parte of men kylled: that is to saye of fyre smoke and brymstone which proceded out of the mouthes of them: 
\v 19 For their power was in their mouthes and in their tayles: for their tayles were lyke vnto serpetes and had heedes and with them they dyd hurt: 
\v 20 And the remnaunt of the men which were not kylled by these plages repented not of the dedes of their hondes that they shulde not worshyppe devyls and ymages of golde and sylver and brasse and stone and of wood which nether can se nether heare nether goo. 
\v 21 Also they repented not of their murther and of their sorcery nether of their fornacion nether of their thefte. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1 And I sawe another myghtye angell come doune from heven clothed with a cloude and the rayne bowe apon his heed. And hys face as it were the sunne and his fete as that were pyllars of fyre 
\v 2 and he had in his honde a lytell boke opyn: and he put his ryght fote apon the see and his lyfte fote on the erth. 
\v 3 And cryed with a lowde voyce as when a lyon roreth. And when he had cryed seven thondres spake their voyces. 
\v 4 And when the vii. thondres had spoken their voyces I was aboute to wryte. And I herde a voyce from heven sayinge vnto me seale vp thoo thynges which the vii. thondres spake and write them not. 
\v 5 And the angell which I sawe stonde apon the see and apon the erth lyfte vppe his honde to heven 
\v 6 and swore by him that liveth for ever more which created heven and the thynges that ther in are and the see and the thynges which therin are: that there shulde be no lenger tyme: 
\v 7 but in the dayes of the voyce of the seventh angell when he shall begyn to blowe: even the mistery of god shalbe fynisshed as he preached by his servauntes the prophetes. 
\v 8 And the voyce which I herde from heven spake vnto me agayne and sayde: goo and take the lytle boke which ys open in the honde of the angell which stondeth apon the see and apon the erth. 
\v 9 And I went vnto the angell and sayde to him: geve me the lytle boke and he sayd vnto me: take it and eate it vp and it shall make thy belly bytter but it shalbe in thy mouth as swete as hony. 
\v 10 and I toke the lytle boke out of his honde and ate it vp and it was in my mouth as swete as hony and as sone as I had eate it my belly was bytter. 
\v 11 And he sayde vnto me: thou muste prophesy agayne amonge the people and nacions and tonges and to many kynges. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 And then was geven me a rede lyke vnto a rodd and it was sayd vnto me: Ryse and mete the temple of god and the aultre and them that worshippe therin 
\v 2 and the quyre which is within the temple cast oute and mete it not: for it is gevyn vnto the gentyles and the holy cite shall they treade vnderfote .xlii. monethes. 
\v 3 And I will geve power vnto my two wytnesses and they shall prophesy .M.iic. and .lx. dayes clothed in sacke cloth. 
\v 4 These are two olyve trees and two candlestyckes stodinge before the god of the erth 
\v 5 And if eny man will hurt them fyre shall procede out of their mouthes and consume their ennemyes. And yf eny man will hurt the this wyse muste he be kylled. 
\v 6 These have power to shut heven that it rayne not in the dayes of their prophesyinge: and have power over waters to turne them to bloud and to smyte the erth with almaner plages as often as they will. 
\v 7 And when they have fynysshed their testimony the beste that cam oute of the bottomlesse pytt shall make warre agaynst them and shall overcome them and kyll them. 
\v 8 And their boddyes shall lye in the stretes of the greate cite which spritually is called zodom and Egypte where oure lorde was crucified. 
\v 9 And they of the people and kynredes and tonges and they of the nacions shall se their bodyes .iii. dayes and an halfe and shall not suffre their boddyes to be put in graves. 
\v 10 And they that dwell apon the erth shall reioyce over them and be glad and shall send gyftes one to another for these two prophetes vexed them that dwelt on the erth. 
\v 11 And after .iii. dayes and an halffe the sprete of lyfe from god entred into the. And they stode vp apon their fete: and greate feare came apon the which sawe them. 
\v 12 And they herde a greate voyce from heven saying vnto them. Come vp hidder. And they ascended vp into heven in a cloude and their ennemyes sawe them. 
\v 13 And the same houre was ther a gret erth quake and the tenthe parte of the cite fell and in the erth quake were slayne names of men seven .M. and the remnaunt were feared and gave glory to god of heven. 
\v 14 The seconde woo is past and beholde the thyrd woo wyll come anon. 
\v 15 And the seventh angell blewe and therwere made great voyces in heven sayinge: the kyngdoms of this worlde are oure lordes and his christes and he shall raygne for ever more. 
\v 16 And the .xxiiii. elders which sytt before god on their seates fell apon their faces and worshipped God 
\v 17 sayinge: we geve the thankes lorde God allmyghte: which arte and wast and arte to come for thou haste receaved thy great myght and hast raygned. 
\v 18 And the nacions were angry and thy wrath is come and the tyme of the deed that they shuld be iudged and that thou shuldest geve rewarde vnto thy servauntes the prophettes and saynctes and to them that feare thy name small and great and shuldest destroye them which destroye the erth. 
\v 19 And the temple of God was openyd in heven and there was sene in his temple the arcke of his testament: and ther folowed lyghtnynges and voyces and thondrynges and erth quake and moche hayle. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 And ther appered a gret wonder in heven A woman clothed with the sunne and the mone vnder her fete and apon her heed a croune of xii. starres. 
\v 2 And she was with chylde and cryed travayllinge in byrth and payned redy to be delyvered. 
\v 3 And ther appered another wonder in heven for beholde a gret red dragon havynge .vii. heddes and ten hornes and crounes vpon his heddes: 
\v 4 and his tayle drue the thyrde parte of the starres and cast them to the erth. And the dragon stode before the woman which was reddy to be delyvred: for to devoure her chylde as sone as it were borne. 
\v 5 And she brought forth a man chylde which shulde rule all nacions with a rode of yron And her sonne was taken vp vnto God and to his seate. 
\v 6 And the woman fleed into wyldernes where she had a place prepared of god that they shulde fede her there a M. .ii .C and lx. dayes. 
\v 7 And ther was grett battayll in heven Michael and his angells fowght with the dragon and the dragon fowght and his angelles 
\v 8 and prevaylled not: nether was their place founde eny more in heven. 
\v 9 And the grett dragon that olde serpent called the devyll and Sathanas was cast out. Which desceaveth all the worlde. And he was cast into the erth and his angelles were cast out also. 
\v 10 And I harde a lowde voyce sayinge: in heven is nowe made salvacion and strengthe and the kyngdome of oure God and the power of his Christ For he is cast doune which accused them before god daye and nyght. 
\v 11 And they overcame him by the bloude of the lambe and by the worde of their testimony and they loved not their lyves vnto the deeth. 
\v 12 Therfore reioyce hevens and ye that dwell in them. Woo to the inhabiters of the erth and of the see: for the devyll is come doune vnto you which hath greet wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short tyme. 
\v 13 And when the dragon sawe that he was caste vnto the erth he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man chylde. 
\v 14 And to the woman were geven two wynges of a great egle that she myght flye into the wyldrenes into her place where she is norysshed for a tyme tymes and halffe a tyme from the presence of the sarpent. 
\v 15 And the dragon cast out of his mouth water after the woman as it had bene a ryver because she hulde have bene caught of the floud. 
\v 16 And the erth holpe the woman and the erth opened her mouth and swalowed vp the rever which the dragon cast out of hys mouth. 
\v 17 And the dragon was wroth with the woman: and went and made warre with the remnaunt of hyr sede which kepe the commaundmentes of god and have the testimony of Iesus Christe. And I stode on the see sonde. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 And I sawe a best rise out of the see havinge vii. heddes and x. hornes and apon hys hornes x. crownes and apon his heed the name of blasphemy. 
\v 2 And the beast which I sawe was lyke a catt of the mountayne and his fete were as the fete of a bear and his mouth as the mouthe of a lyon. And the dragon gave him his power and his seate and grett auctorite: 
\v 3 and I sawe one of his heedes as it were wouded to deth and his dedly woude was healed. And all the worlde wondred at the beast 
\v 4 and they worshipped the dragon which gave power vnto the beest and they worshipped the beest sayinge: who is lyke vnto the beast? who is able to warre with him? 
\v 5 And ther was a mouth geve vnto him that spake great thinges and blasphemies and power was geve vnto him to do xlii. monethes 
\v 6 And he opened his mowth vnto blasphemy agaynst God to blaspheme hys name and his tabernacle and them that dwell in heven. 
\v 7 And it was geven vnto him to make warre with the saynctes and to overcome them. And power was geven him over all kynred tonge and nacion: 
\v 8 and all that dwell apon the erth worshipt him: whose names are not written in the boke of lyfe of the lambe which was kylled from the begynnynge of the worlde. 
\v 9 Yf eny man have an eare lett him heare. 
\v 10 He that leadeth into captivite shall goo into captivite: he that kylleth with a swearde must be kylled with a swearde. Heare is the pacience and the fayth of the saynctes. 
\v 11 And I behelde another best commynge vp oute of the erth and he had two hornes like a lambe and he spake as dyd the dragon. 
\v 12 And he dyd all that the fyrste beest coulde do in his presence and he caused the erth and them which dwell therin to worshippe the fyrst beest whose dedly woude was healed. 
\v 13 And he dyd grett wonders so that he made fyre come doune from heven in the syght of men. 
\v 14 And deceaved them that dwelt on the erth by the meanes of those signes which he had power to doo in the sight of the beest sayinge to the that dwelt on the erth: that they shuld make an ymage vnto the beest which had the woude of a swearde and dyd lyve. 
\v 15 And he had power to geve a sprete vnto the ymage of the beest and that the ymage of the beest shuld speake and shuld cause that as many as wolde not worshyppe the ymage of the beest shuld be kylled. 
\v 16 And he made all bothe smale and grett ryche and poore fre and bond to receave a marke in their right hondes or in their forheddes. 
\v 17 And that no man myght by or sell save he that had the marke or the name of the beest other the nombre of his name. 
\v 18 Here is wisdome. Let him that hath wytt count the nombre of the beest. For it is the nombre of a man and his nombre is sixe hondred threscore and sixe. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1 And I loked and loo a lambe stode on the mount Syon and with him C. and xliiii. thousande havynge his fathers name written in their forhedes. 
\v 2 And I herde a voyce from heven as the sounde of many waters and as the voyce of a gret thoundre And I herde the voyce of harpers harpynge with their harpes. 
\v 3 And they songe as it were a newe songe before the seate and before the foure beestes and the elders and no man coulde learne that songe but the hondred and xliiii.M. which were redemed from the erth. 
\v 4 These are they which were not defyled with wemen for they are virgyns. These folowe the lambe whither soever he goeth. These were redemed from men beynge the fyrste frutes vnto God and to the lambe 
\v 5 and in their mouthes was foude no gyle. For they - are with oute spott before the trone of god. 
\v 6 And I sawe an angell flye in the myddes of heven havynge an everlastynge gospell to preache vnto them that sytt and dwell on the erth and to all nacions kinreddes and tonges and people 
\v 7 sayinge with a lowde voyce: Feare God and geve honour to him for the houre of his iudgement is come: and worshyppe him that made heven and erth and the see and fountaynes of water. 
\v 8 And there folowed another angell sayinge: Babilon is fallen is fallen that gret cite for she made all nacions drynke of the wyne of hyr fornicacion. 
\v 9 And the thyrde angell folowed them sayinge with aloude voyce: Yf eny man worshippe the beest and his ymage and receave hie marke in his forhed or on his honde 
\v 10 the same shall drynke of the wyne of the wrath of God which is powred in the cuppe of his wrath. And he shalbe punnysshed in fyre and brymstone before the holy Angels and before the lambe. 
\v 11 And the smoke of their turment ascendeth vp evermore. And they have no rest daye ner nyght which worshippe the beast and his ymage and whosoever receaveth the prynt of his name. 
\v 12 Here is the pacience of saynctes. Heare are they that kepe the commaundmentes and the fayth of Iesu. 
\v 13 And I herde a voyce from heven sayinge vnto me: wryte. Blessed are the deed which here after dye in the lorde even soo sayth the sprete: that they maye rest from their laboures but their workes shall folowe them. 
\v 14 And I loked and beholde a whyte clowde and apon the clowde one syttynge lyke vnto the sonne of man havynge on his heed a golde crowne and in his honde a sharpe sykle. 
\v 15 And another angell came oute of the temple cryinge with a lowde voyce to him that sate on the clowde. Thruste in thy sycle and repe: for the tyme is come to repe for the corne of the erth is rype. 
\v 16 And he that sate on the clowde thrust in his sykle on the erth and the erth was reped. 
\v 17 And another angell came oute of the temple which is in heven havynge also a sharpe sycle. 
\v 18 And another angell came oute from that aultre which had power over fyre and cryed with a lowde crye to him that had the sharpe sykle and sayde: thrust in thy sharpe sykle and gaddre the clusters of the erth for her grapes are rype. 
\v 19 And the angell thrust in his sykle on the erth and cut doune the grapes of the vyneyarde of the erth: and cast them into the gret wynefat of the wrath of god 
\v 20 and the wynefat was trodden with out the cite and bloud came oute of the fat even vnto the hors brydles by the space of a thowsande and .vi. C. furlonges. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1 And I sawe another signe in heven grett and mervellous .vii. angells havynge the seven laste plages for in the is fulfylled the wrath of god. 
\v 2 And I sawe as it were a glassye see mingled with fyre and the that had gotten victory of the beest and of his ymage and of his marke and of the nombre of his name stode on the glassye see havinge the harpes of god 
\v 3 and they songe the songe of Moses the servaunt of god and the songe of the lambe sayinge. Gret and marvellous are thy workes Lorde god almyghty iuste and true are thy wayes kynge of saynctes. 
\v 4 Who shall not feare o lorde and gloryfy thy name? For thou only arte holy and all gentylls shall come and worshippe before the for thy iudgmentes are made manyfeste. 
\v 5 And after that I loked and beholde the temple of the tabernacle of testimony was opyn in heven 
\v 6 and the seven angelles cam out of the temple which had the seven plages clothed in pure and bryght lynnen and havynge their brestes gyrded with golden gerdelles. 
\v 7 And one of the fowre beestes gave vnto the seve angells vii. golden vialles full of the wrath of God which lyveth for ever more. 
\v 8 And the temple was full of the smoke of the glory of God and of his power and no man was able to entre into the temple tyll the seven plages of the seven angels were fulfilled. 
\c 16  
\p
\v 1 And I herde a great voyce out of the temple sayinge to the seven angels: goo youre wayes poure out youre vialles of wrath apon the erth. 
\v 2 And the fyrst went and poured out his viall apon the erth and there fell anoysom and a sore botche apon the men which had the marke of the best and apon the which worshipped his ymage. 
\v 3 And the seconde angell shed out his viall apon the see and it turned as it were into the bloud of a deed man: and every lyvinge thynge dyed in the see. 
\v 4 And the thyrde angell shed out his vyall apon the ryvers and fountaynes of waters and they turned to bloud. 
\v 5 And I herde an angell saye: lorde which arte and wast thou arte ryghteous and holy because thou hast geve soche iudgmentes 
\v 6 for they shed out the bloude of sayntes and prophettes and therfore hast thou geven them bloud to drynke: for they are worthy. 
\v 7 And I herde another out of the aultre saye: even soo lorde god almyghty true and righteous are thy iudgementes. 
\v 8 And the fourth angell poured out his viall on the sunne and power was geve vnto him to vexe men with heate of fyre. 
\v 9 And the men raged in gret heate and spake evyll of the name of God which had power over those plages and they repented not to geve him glory. 
\v 10 And the fifte angell poured out his vyall apon the seate of the beste and his kyngdome wexed derke and they gnewe their tonges for sorowe 
\v 11 and blasphemed the god of heven for sorowe and payne of their sores and repented not of their dedes. 
\v 12 And the sixte angell poured out his vyall apon the gret ryver Euphrates and the water dryed vp that the wayes of the kyngss of the este shulde be prepared. 
\v 13 And I sawe thre vnclene sprettes lyke frogges come out of the mouthe of the dragon and out of the mouthe of the beeste and out of the mouthe of the falce prophett. 
\v 14 For they are the sprettes of devyls workynge myracles to go out vnto the kynges of the erth and of the whole worlde to gaddre them to the battayle of that gret daye of God allmyghty. 
\v 15 Beholde I come as a thefe. Happy is he that watcheth and kepeth his garmentes Lest he be founde naked and men se his filthynes. 
\v 16 And he gaddered them togedder into a place called in the hebrue tonge Armagedon. 
\v 17 And the seventhe angell poured out his viall in to the ayre. And there came a voyce out of heven from the seate sayinge: it is done. 
\v 18 And there folowed voyces thondringes and lightnynges and there was a grett erthquake soche as was not sence men were apon the erth so myghty an erthquake and so grett. 
\v 19 And the greate cite was devyded into thre parties And the cities of nacions fell. And grett Babilon came in remembraunce before God to geve vnto hyr the cuppe of wyne of the fearcenes of his wrathe. 
\v 20 Every yle fled awaye and the mountaynes were not founde. 
\v 21 And ther fell a gret hayle as it had bene talentes out of heven apon the men and the men blasphemed God be cause of the plage of the hayle for it was grett and the plage of it sore. 
\c 17  
\p
\v 1 And there cam one of the seven angels which had the seven vialles and talked with me sayinge vnto me: come I will shewe the the iudgment of the grett whore that sytteth apon many waters 
\v 2 with whome have commytted fornicacion the kynges of the erth so that the inhabiters of the erth are droken with the wyne of her fornicacion. 
\v 3 And he caryed me a waye into the wildernes in the sprete. And I sawe a woman sytt apon a rose colored best full of names of blaphemie which had ten hornes. 
\v 4 And the woman was arayed in purple and rose color and decked with golde precious stone and pearles and had a cup of golde in her honde full of abominacions and fylthynes of her fornycacion. 
\v 5 And in her forhed was a name wrytten a mistery gret Babylon the mother of whordome and abominacions of the erth. 
\v 6 And I sawe the wyfe dronke with the bloud of saynctes and with the bloud of the witnesses of Iesu. And when I sawe her I wondred with grett mervayle. 
\v 7 And the angell sayde vnto me: wherfore mervayllyst thou? I wyll shewe the the mistery of the woman and of the best that berith her which hath seven heddes and ten hornes. 
\v 8 The best that thou seest was and is not and shall ascende out of the bottomlesse pytt and shall goo into perdicion and they that dwell on the erth shall wondre (whose names are not wrytten in the boke of lyfe from the begynnynge of the worlde) when they beholde the best that was and ys nott. 
\v 9 And here ys a mynde that hath wisdome. The seven heddes are seven mountaynes on which the woman sytteth: 
\v 10 they are also seven kynges. Fyve are fallen and on ys and onother is not yet come. When he cometh he muste contynew a space. 
\v 11 And the beste that was and ys not is even the ayght and ys one of the seven and shall goo into destruccion. 
\v 12 And the ten hornes which thou seist are ten kynges which have receaved no kyngdome but shall receave power as kynges at one houre with the beest. 
\v 13 These have one mynde and shall geve their power and strenghte vnto the beste. 
\v 14 These shall fyght with the lambe and the lambe shall overcome them: For he is lorde of lordes and kynge of kynges: and they that are on hys syde are called and chosen and faythfull. 
\v 15 And he sayde vnto me: the waters which thou sawest where the whore syttith are people and folke and nacions and tonges. 
\v 16 And the ten hornes which thou sawest apon the best are they that shall hate the whore and shall make her desolate and naked and shall eate their flesshe and burne her with fyre. 
\v 17 For God hathe put in their hertes to fulfyll hys wyll and to do with one consent for to geve hir kyngdom vnto the beast vntill the wordes of God be fulfylled. 
\v 18 And the woman which thou sawest ys that gret cyte which raigneth over the kynges of the erth. 
\c 18  
\p
\v 1 And after that I sawe another angell come from heven havinge gret power and the erth was lyghtned with hys bryghtnes. 
\v 2 And he cryed myghtyly with a stronge voyce sayinge: Great Babilon is fallen ys fallen and ys become the habitation of devels and the holde of all fowle sprettes and a cage of all vnclene and hatefull byrdes 
\v 3 for all nacions have dronken of the wyne of the wrath of her fornycacion. And the kynges of the erth have committed fornicacion with her and her marchauntes are wexed ryche of the abundance of her pleasures. 
\v 4 And I herde another voyce from heven saye: come a waye from her my people that ye be not parttakers in her synnes that ye receave not of her plages. 
\v 5 For her synnes are gon vp to heven and God hath remembred her wyckednes. 
\v 6 Rewarde her even as she rewarded you and geve her dubble accordynge to her workes. And poure in dubble to her in the same cuppe which she fylled vnto you. 
\v 7 And as moche as she gloryfied her silfe and lyved wantanly so moche poure ye in for her of punysshment and sorowe for she sayde in her herte: I sytt beinge a quene and am no wyddowe and shall se no sorowe. 
\v 8 Therfore shall her plages come at one daye deeth and sorowe and honger and she shallbe brent with fyre: for stronge ys the lorde god which iudgeth her. 
\v 9 And the kynges of the erth shalbe wepe her and wayle over her which have committed fornicacion with her and have lyved wantanly with her when they shall se the smoke of her burnynge 
\v 10 and shall stonde a farre of for feare of her punnysshment sayinge: Alas Alas that gret cite Babilon that myghty cite: For at won houre is her iudgment come. 
\v 11 And the marchauntes of the erth shall wepe and wayle in them selves for no man wyll bye their ware eny more 
\v 12 the ware of golde and silver and precious stones nether of pearle and raynes and purple and skarlet and all thyne wodde and almanner vessels of yvery and almanner vessels of most precious wodde and of brasse and of yron 
\v 13 and synamon and odours and oyntmentes and frankynsence and wyne and oyle and fyne floure and wheate bestes and shepe and horsys and charrettes and boddyes and soules of men. 
\v 14 And the apples that thy soule lusted after are departed from the. And all thynges which were deyntie and had in pryce are departed from the and thou shalt fynde them no more. 
\v 15 The marchauntes of these thynges which were wexed ryche shall stonde a farre of from her for feare of the punyshment of her wepynge and waylynge 
\v 16 and saying: alas alas that grett cite that was clothed in raynes and purple and scarlett and decked with golde and precious stone and pearles: 
\v 17 for at one houre so great ryches ys come to nought. And every shippe governer and all they that occupied shippes and shippmen which worke in the see stode a farre of 
\v 18 and cryed when they sawe the smoke of her burnynge sayinge what cite is lyke vnto this grett cite? 
\v 19 And they cast dust on their heddes and cryed wepynge and waylinge and sayed: Alas Alas that greate cite wherin were made ryche all that had shyppes in the see by the reason of her costlynes for atone houre is she made desolate 
\v 20 Reioyce over her thou heven and the holy Apostles and prophetes: for god hath geven youre iudgment on her. 
\v 21 And a myghty angell toke vp a stone lyke a grett mylstone and cast it into the see sayinge: with suche violence shall that gret cite Babilon be cast and shallbe founde no more. 
\v 22 And the voyce of harpers and musicions and of pypers and trompetters shalbe herde no more in the: and no craftes man of whatsoever craft he be shalbe founde eny more in the. and the soude of a myll shalbe herde no more in the 
\v 23 and the voyce of the brydegrome and of the bryde shalbe herde no more in the: for thy marchauntes were the grett men of the erth. And with thyne inchantment were deceaved all nacions: 
\v 24 and in her was founde the bloude of the prophettes and of the saynctes and of all that were slayne apon the erth. 
\c 19  
\p
\v 1 And after that I herde the voyce of moche people in heven sayinge: Alleluia. Saluacion and glory and honour and power be ascribed to the lorde oure god 
\v 2 for true and ryghteous are his iudgmentes for he hath iudged the grett whore which did corrupt the erth with her fornicacion and hath avenged the bloud of his servauntes of her hond. 
\v 3 And agayne they said: Alleluya. And smoke rose vp for evermore. 
\v 4 And the xxiiii. elders and the iiii. bestes fell doune and worshypped god that sate on the seate sayinge: Amen Alleluya. 
\v 5 And a voyce cam out of the seate saying: prayse oure lorde god all ye that are his servauntes and ye that feare him both small and grett. 
\v 6 And I herde the voyce of moche people even as the voyce of many waters and as the voyce of stronge thondrynges sayinge: Alleluya for god omnipotent raigneth. 
\v 7 Let vs be glad and reioyce and geve honour to him: for the mariage of the lambe is come and hys wyffe made her sylfe reddy. 
\v 8 And to her was graunted that she shulde be arayed with pure and goodly raynes. For the raynes is the ryghtewesnes of saynctes. 
\v 9 And he sayde vnto me: happy are they which are called vnto the Lambes supper. And he sayde vnto me: these are the true sayinges of God. 
\v 10 And I fell at his fete to worshyppe him. And he sayde vnto me se thou do it not. For I am thy felowe seruaunt and one of thy brethern and of them that have the testimony of Iesus. Worshyppe God. For the testymony of Iesus ys the sprete of prophesy. 
\v 11 And I sawe heven open and beholde a whyte horsse: and he that sat apon him was faythfull and true and in ryghtewesnes dyd iudge and make battayle. 
\v 12 His eyes were as a flame of fyre: and on his heed were many crounes: and he had a name written that noman knewe but him sylfe. 
\v 13 And he was clothed with a vesture dipt in bloud and and hys name ys called the worde of God. 
\v 14 And the warriers which were in heven folowed him apon whyte horsses clothed with whyte and pure raynes: 
\v 15 and out of his mouthe went out a sharppe swerde that with that he shuld smyte the hethen. And he shall rule them with a rodde of yron and he trode the wynefatt of fearsnes and wrath of almyghty god. 
\v 16 And hath on his vesture and on his thygh a name written: kynge of kynges and lorde of lordes. 
\v 17 And I sawe an angell stonde in the sunne and he cryed with a lowde voyce sayinge to all the fowles that flye by the myddes of heven come and gaddre youre selves to gedder vnto the supper of the gret god 
\v 18 that ye maye eate the flesshe of kynges and of hye captaynes and the flesshe of myghty men and the flesshe of horsses and of them that sytt on them and the flesshe of all free men and bond men and of small and gret. 
\v 19 And I sawe the beste and the kynges of the erth and their warriers gaddred to gedder to make battayle agaynste him that satt on the horsse and agaynst his sowdiers. 
\v 20 And the beste was take and with him that falce prophett that wrought myracles before him with which he desceaved the that receaved the beestes marke and them that worshipped his ymage. These both were cast into a pode of fyre burnyge with brymstone: 
\v 21 and the remnaunte were slayne with the swearde of him that sat apon the horsse which swearde proceded out of his mouthe and all the foules were fulfilled with their flesshe. 
\c 20  
\p
\v 1 And I sawe an angell come doune from heven havinge the kaye of the bottomlesse pyt and a gret chayne in his honde. 
\v 2 And he toke the dragon that olde serpet which is the devyll and Satanas and he bounde him a thousand yeares: 
\v 3 and cast him into the bottomlesse pit and he bounde him and set a seale on him that he shuld desceaue the people no moare tyll the .M. yeares were fulfilled. And after that he muste be loosed for a litell season. 
\v 4 And I sawe seattes and they sat apon them and iudgement was geven vnto them: and I sawe the soules of them that were behedded for the witnes of Iesu and for the worde of God: which had not worshypped the best nether his ymage nether had taken his marke vpon their forheddes or on their hondes: and they lyved and raygned with Christ a .M. yere: 
\v 5 but the wother of the deed men lyved not agayne vntyll the .M. yere were fynisshed. This is that fyrst resurreccion. 
\v 6 Blessed and holy is he that hath parte in the fyrst resurreccion. For on suche shall the seconde deeth have no power for they shalbe the prestes of God and of Christ and shall raygne with him a .M. yere. 
\v 7 And when the .M. yeares are experied Satan shalbe lowsed out of his preson 
\v 8 and shall goo oute to deceave the people which are in the foure quarters of the erth Gog and Magog to gadder them to gedder to batayle whose nombre is as the sonde of the see: 
\v 9 and they went vp on the playne of the erth and compased the tentes of the saynctes about and the beloved cite. And fyre cam doune from God out of heven and devoured them: 
\v 10 and the devyll that desceaved them was cast into a lake of fyre and brymstone where the beest and the falce prophet were and shalbe tormented daye and nyght for ever more. 
\v 11 And I sawe a grett whyte seate and him that sate on it from whose face fleed awaye both the erth and heaven and their place was no more founde. 
\v 12 And I sawe the deed both grett and small stonde before God: And the bokes were opened and another boke was opened which is the boke of lyfe and the deed were iudged of thoo thynges which weer wrytten in the bokes accordinge to their dedes: 
\v 13 and the see gave vp her deed which were in her and deth and hell delyvered vp the deed which were in them: and they were iudged every man accordinge to his dedes. 
\v 14 And deth and hell were cast into the lake of fyre. This is that second deeth. 
\v 15 And whosoever was not founde written in the boke of lyfe was cast into the lake of fyre. 
\c 21  
\p
\v 1 And I sawe a newe heven and a newe erth For the fyrst heven and the fyrst erth were vanysshed awaye and there was no more see. 
\v 2 And I Ihon sawe that holy cite newe Ierusalem come doune from God oute of heven prepared as a bryde garnysshed for hyr husband. 
\v 3 And I herde a grett voyce out of heaven sayinge: beholde the tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with the And they shalbe his people and God him sylffe shalbe with the and be their god. 
\v 4 And God shall wype awaye all teares from their eyes. And there shalbe nomore deeth nether sorowe nether cryinge nether shall there be eny more payne for the olde thynges are gone. 
\v 5 And he that sate apon the seate sayde: Behold I make all thynges newe. And he sayde vnto me: wryte for these wordes are faythfull and true. 
\v 6 And he sayde vnto me: it is done I am Alpha and Omega the begynnynge and the ende. I will geve to him that is a thyrst of the well of the water of lyfe fre. 
\v 7 He that overcometh shall inheret all thynges and I will be his God and he shalbe my sonne. 
\v 8 But the fearefull and vnbelevynge and the abhominable and murdrers and whormongers and sorcerers and ydolaters and all lyars shall have their parte in the lake which burnyth with fyre and brymstone which is the seconde deth. 
\v 9 And there cam vnto me one of the vii. angels which had the vii. vyals full of the vii. laste plages: and talked with me sayinge: come hydder I will shewe the the bryde the lambes wyfe. 
\v 10 And he caryed me awaye in the sprete to a grett and an hye mountayne and he shewed me the grett cite holy Ierusalem descendinge out of heven from God 
\v 11 havynge the brightnes of God. And her shynynge was lyke vnto a stone moste precious even a Iaspar cleare as cristall: 
\v 12 and had walles grett and hye and had xii gates and at the gates xii. angels: and names written which are the xii. trybes of Israell: 
\v 13 on the est parte iii gatis and on the north syde iii gates and to wardes the south iii gates and from the west iii gates: 
\v 14 and the wall of the cite had xii foundacions and in them the names of the lambes .xii. Apostles. 
\v 15 And he that talked with me had a golden read to measure the cite with all and the gates therof and the wall therof. 
\v 16 And the cite was bylt iiii. square and the length was as large as the bredth of it and he measured the cite with the rede .xii M. fur longes: and the lenght and the bredth and the heyth of it were equall. 
\v 17 And he measured the wall therof. an cxliiii. cubittes: the measure that the angell had was after the measure that man vseth. 
\v 18 And the byldinge of the wall of it was of iaspar. And the cite was pure gold lyke vnto cleare glasse 
\v 19 and the foundacions of the wall of the cite was garnisshed with all maner of precious stones The fyrste foundacion was iaspar the seconde saphyre the thyrde a calcedony the fourth an emeralde: 
\v 20 the fyft sardonix: the sixt sardeos: the seventh crysolite the ayght berall: the nynth a topas: the tenth a crysoprasos: the eleventh a iacyncte: the twelfe an amatist. 
\v 21 The xii. gates were xii pearles every gate was of one pearle and the strete of the cite was pure golde as thorowe shynynge glasse. 
\v 22 And there was no temple therin. For the lord god allmyghty and the lambe are the temple of it 
\v 23 and the cite hath no nede of the sonne nether of the mone to lyghten it. For the bryghtnes of God dyd light it: and the lambe was the light of it. 
\v 24 And the people which are saved shall walke in the light of it: and the kynges of the erth shall brynge their glory vnto it. 
\v 25 And the gates of it are not shut by daye. For there shalbe no nyght there. 
\v 26  
\v 27 And there shall entre into it none vnclene thynge: nether what soever worketh abhominacion: or maketh lyes: but they only which are wrytten in the lambes boke of lyfe. 
\c 22  
\p
\v 1 And he shewed me a pure ryver of water of lyfe clere as cristall: procedynge oute of the seate of God and of the lambe. 
\v 2 In the myddes of the strete of it and of ether syde of the ryver was there wode of lyfe: which bare xii maner of frutes: and gave frute every moneth: and the leves of the wodde served to heale the people with all. 
\v 3 And there shalbe no more cursse but the seate of god and the lambe shalbe in it: and his servauntes shall serve him: 
\v 4 And shall se his face and his name shalbe in their forheddes. 
\v 5 And there shall be no nyght there and they nede no candle nether light of the sunne: for the lorde God geveth them light and they shall raygne for evermore. 
\v 6 And he sayde vnto me: these sayinges are faythfull and true. And the lorde god of saynctes and prophetes sent his angell to shewe vnto his servauntes the thynges which muste shortly be fulfylled. 
\v 7 Beholde I come shortly. Happy is he that kepeth the sayinge of the prophesy of this boke. 
\v 8 I am Ihon which sawe these thynges and herde them. And when I had herde and sene I fell doune to worshippe before the fete of the angell which shewed me these thynges. 
\v 9 And he sayd vnto me: se thou do it not for I am thy feloweservaunt and the feloweservaunt of thy brethren the prophettes and of them which kepe the sayinges of this boke. But worshippe God. 
\v 10 And he sayde vnto me: seale not the sayinges of prophesy of this boke. For the tyme is at honde. 
\v 11 He that doeth evyl let him do evyl still: and he which is fylthy let him be fylthy still: and he that is righteous let him be more righteous: and he that is holy let him be more holy. 
\v 12 And beholde I come shortly and my rewarde with me to geve every man accordinge as his dedes shalbe. 
\v 13 I am Alpha and Omega the begynninge and the ende: the fyrst and the last. 
\v 14 Blessed are they that do hys commaundmentes that their power maye be in the tree of lyfe and maye entre in thorow the gates into the cite. 
\v 15 For without shalbe dogges and inchauters and whormongers and mortherers and ydolaters and whosoever loveth or makith lesynges. 
\v 16 I Iesus sent myne angell to testyfye vnto you these thynges in the congregacions. I am the rote and the generacion of David and the bright mornynge starre. 
\v 17 And the sprete and the bryde sayde come. And let him that heareth saye also come. And let him that is athyrst come. And let whosoever wyll take of the water of lyfe fre. 
\v 18 I testifye vnto every man that heareth the wordes of prophesy of thys boke. yf eny man shall adde vnto these thynges god shall adde vnto him the plages that are wrytten in this boke. 
\v 19 And yf eny man shall mynyshe of the wordes of the boke of this prophesy god shall take a waye his parte out of the boke of lyfe and oute of the holy citie and from thoo thynge which are written in this boke. 
\v 20 He which testifyeth these thinges sayth: be it I come quyckly Amen. Even soo: come lorde Iesu. 
\v 21 The grace of oure lorde Iesu Christ be with you all. Amen.
