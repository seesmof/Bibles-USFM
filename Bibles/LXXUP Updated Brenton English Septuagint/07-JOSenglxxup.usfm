\v 1  \sc And\sc* it came to pass after the death of Moses, that the Lord spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Moses my servant is dead; now then arise, go over Jordan, thou and all this people, into the land, which I give them. 
\v 3 Every spot on which ye shall tread I will give it you, as I said to Moses. 
\v 4 The wilderness and Antilebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates, and as far as the extremity of the sea; your coasts shall be from the setting of the sun. 
\v 5 Not a man shall stand against you all the days of thy life; and as I was with Moses, so will I also be with thee, and I will not fail thee, or neglect thee. 
\v 6 Be strong and quit thyself like a man, for thou shalt divide the land to this people, which I swore to give to your fathers. 
\v 7 Be strong, therefore, and quit thyself like a man, to observe and do as Moses my servant commanded thee; and thou shalt not turn therefrom to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest be wise in whatsoever thou mayest do. 
\v 8 And the book of this law shall not depart out of thy mouth, and thou shalt meditate in it day and night, that thou mayest know how to do all the things that are written \add in it\add*; then shalt thou prosper, and make thy ways prosperous, and then shalt thou be wise. 
\v 9 Lo! I have commanded thee; be strong and courageous, be not cowardly nor fearful, for the Lord thy God is with thee in all places whither thou goest. 
\v 10 And Joshua commanded the scribes of the people, saying, 
\v 11 Go into the midst of the camp of the people, and command the people, saying, Prepare provisions; for yet three days and ye shall go over this Jordan, entering in to take possession of the land, which the Lord God of your fathers gives to you. 
\p
\v 12 And to Reuben, and to Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, Joshua said, 
\v 13 Remember the word which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you, saying, The Lord your God has caused you to rest, and has given you this land. 
\v 14 Let your wives and your children and your cattle dwell in the land, which he has given you; and ye shall go over well armed before your brethren, every one of you who is strong; and ye shall fight on their side; 
\v 15 until the Lord your God shall have given your brethren rest, as also to you, and they also shall have inherited the land, which the Lord your God gives them; then ye shall depart each one to his inheritance, which Moses gave you beyond Jordan eastward. 
\v 16 And they answered Joshua and said, We will do all things which thou commandest us, and we will go to every place whither thou shalt send us. 
\v 17 Whereinsoever we hearkened to Moses we will hearken to thee; only let the Lord our God be with thee, as he was with Moses. 
\v 18 And whosoever shall disobey thee, and whosoever shall not hearken to thy words as thou shalt command him, let him die; but be thou strong and courageous.

\p
\v 1 And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two young men to spy \add the land\add*, saying, Go up and view the land and Jericho: and the two young men went and entered into Jericho; and they entered into the house of a harlot, whose name \add was\add* Rahab, and lodged there. 
\p
\v 2 And it was reported to the king of Jericho, saying, Men of the sons of Israel have come in hither to spy the land. 
\v 3 And the king of Jericho sent and spoke to Rahab, saying, Bring out the men that entered into thy house this night; for they are come to spy out the land. 
\v 4 And the woman took the two men and hid them; and she spoke to the messengers, saying, The men came in to me, 
\v 5 but when the gate was shut in the evening, the men went out; I know not whither they are gone: follow after them, if ye may overtake them. 
\v 6 But she \add had\add* brought them up upon the house, and hid them in the flax stalks that were spread by her on the house. 
\v 7 And the men followed after them in the way to Jordan to the fords; and the gate was shut. 
\p
\v 8 And it came to pass when the men who pursued after them were gone forth, and before the spies had lain down to sleep, that she came up to them on the top of the house; 
\v 9 and she said to them, I know that the Lord has given you the land; for the fear of you has fallen upon us. 
\v 10 For we have heard that the Lord God dried up the Red Sea before you, when ye came out of the land of Egypt, and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond Jordan, to Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed. 
\v 11 And when we heard it we were amazed in our heart, and there was no longer any spirit in any of us because of you, for the Lord your God \add is\add* God in heaven above, and on the earth beneath. 
\v 12 And now swear to me by the Lord God; since I deal mercifully with you, so do ye also deal mercifully with the house of my father: 
\v 13 and save alive the house of my father, my mother, and my brethren, and all my house, and all that they have, and ye shall rescue my soul from death. 
\p
\v 14 And the men said to her, Our life for yours \add even\add* to death: and she said, When the Lord shall have delivered the city to you, ye shall deal mercifully and truly with me. 
\v 15 And she let them down by the window; 
\v 16 and she said to them, Depart into the hill country, lest the pursuers meet you, and ye shall be hidden there three days until your pursuers return from after you, and afterward ye shall depart on your way. 
\p
\v 17 And the men said to her, We are clear of this thy oath. 
\v 18 Behold, we shall enter into a part of the city, and thou shalt set a sign; thou shalt bind this scarlet cord in the window, by which thou hast let us down, and thou shalt bring in to thyself, into thy house, thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all the family of thy father. 
\v 19 And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall go outside the door of thy house, his guilt shall be upon him, and we shall be quit of this thine oath; and we will be responsible for all that shall be found with thee in thy house. 
\v 20 But if anyone should injure us, or betray these our matters, we shall be quit of this thine oath. 
\v 21 And she said to them, Let it be according to your word; and she sent them out, and they departed. 
\v 22 And they came to the hill country, and remained there three days; and the pursuers searched all the roads, and found them not. 
\p
\v 23 And the two young men returned, and came down out of the mountain; and they went over to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all things that had happened to them. 
\v 24 And they said to Joshua, The Lord has delivered all the land into our power, and all the inhabitants of that land tremble because of us. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and departed from Shittim; and they came as far as Jordan, and lodged there before they crossed over. 
\v 2 And it came to pass after three days, \add that\add* the scribes went through the camp; 
\v 3 and they charged the people, saying, When ye shall see the ark of the covenant of the Lord our God, and our priests and the Levites bearing it, ye shall depart from your places, and ye shall go after it. 
\v 4 But let there be a distance between you and it; ye shall stand as much as two thousand cubits \add from it\add*. Do not draw nigh to it, that ye may know the way which ye are to go; for ye have not gone the way before. 
\p
\v 5 And Joshua said to the people, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow, for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among you. 
\v 6 And Joshua said to the priests, Take up the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and go before the people: and the priests took up the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and went before the people. 
\v 7 And the Lord said to Joshua, This day do I begin to exalt thee before all the children of Israel, that they may know that as I was with Moses, so will I also be with thee. 
\v 8 And now charge the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, As soon as ye shall enter on a part of the water of Jordan, then ye shall stand in Jordan. 
\p
\v 9 And Joshua said to the children of Israel, Come hither, and hearken to the word of the Lord our God. 
\v 10 Hereby ye shall know that the living God \add is\add* among you, and will utterly destroy from before our face the Canaanite, and the Hittite and Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Amorite, and the Girgashite, and the Jebusite. 
\v 11 Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passes over Jordan. 
\v 12 Choose for yourselves twelve men of the sons of Israel, one of each tribe. 
\v 13 And it shall come to pass, when the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord of the whole earth rest in the water of Jordan, the water of Jordan \add below\add* shall fail, and the water coming down from above shall stop. 
\p
\v 14 And the people removed from their tents to cross over Jordan, and the priests bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord before the people. 
\v 15 And when the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord entered upon Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord were dipped in part of the water of Jordan (now Jordan overflowed all its banks about the time of wheat harvest): 
\v 16 then the waters that came down from above stopped; there stood one solid heap very far off, as far as the region of Kiriath-jearim, and the lower part came down to the Sea of Arabah, the salt sea, till it completely failed; and the people stood opposite Jericho. 
\v 17 And the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord stood on dry land in the midst of Jordan; and all the children of Israel went through on dry land, until all the people had completely gone over Jordan. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 And when the people had completely passed over Jordan, the Lord spoke to Joshua, saying, 
\v 2 Take men from the people, one of each tribe, 
\v 3 and charge them; and ye shall take out of the midst of Jordan twelve fit stones, and having carried them across together with yourselves, place them in your camp, where ye shall encamp for the night. 
\p
\v 4 And Joshua having called twelve men of distinction among the children of Israel, one of each tribe, 
\v 5 said to them, Advance before me in the presence of the Lord into the midst of Jordan, and each having taken up a stone from thence, let him carry it on his shoulders, according to the number of the twelve tribes of Israel: 
\v 6 that these may be to you continually for an appointed sign, that when thy son asks thee in future, saying, What are these stones to us? 
\v 7 then thou mayest explain to thy son, saying, The river Jordan was dried up from before the ark of the covenant of the Lord of the whole earth, when it passed it: and these stones shall be for a memorial for you for the children of Israel forever. 
\p
\v 8 And the children of Israel did so, as the Lord commanded Joshua; and they took up twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan (as the Lord commanded Joshua, when the children of Israel had completely passed over), and carried these stones with them into the camp, and laid them down there. 
\v 9 And Joshua set also other twelve stones in Jordan itself, in the place that was under the feet of the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord; and there they are to this day. 
\p
\v 10 And the priests that bore the ark of the covenant stood in Jordan, until Joshua \add had\add* finished all that the Lord commanded him to report to the people; and the people hastened and passed over. 
\v 11 And it came to pass when all the people had passed over, that the ark of the covenant of the Lord passed over, and the stones before them. 
\v 12 And the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses commanded them. 
\v 13 Forty thousand armed for battle went over before the Lord to war, to the city of Jericho. 
\v 14 In that day the Lord magnified Joshua before all the people of Israel; and they feared him, as \add they did\add* Moses, as long as he lived. 
\p
\v 15 And the Lord spoke to Joshua, saying, 
\v 16 Charge the priests that bear the ark of the covenant of the testimony of the Lord, to go up out of Jordan. 
\v 17 And Joshua charged the priests, saying, Go up out of Jordan. 
\v 18 And it came to pass when the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord were gone up out of Jordan, and set their feet upon the land, \add that\add* the water of Jordan returned impetuously to its place, and went as before over all its banks. 
\p
\v 19 And the people went up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month; and the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal in the region eastward from Jericho. 
\v 20 And Joshua set these twelve stones which he took out of Jordan, in Gilgal, 
\v 21 saying, When your sons ask you, saying, What are these stones? 
\v 22 Tell your sons, that Israel went over this Jordan on dry land, 
\v 23 when the Lord our God had dried up the water of Jordan from before them, until they had passed over; as the Lord our God did to the Red Sea, which the Lord our God dried up from before us, until we passed over. 
\v 24 That all the nations of the earth might know, that the power of the Lord is mighty, and that ye might worship the Lord our God in every work. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass when the kings of the Amorites who were beyond Jordan heard, and the kings of Phoenicia by the sea, that the Lord God had dried up the river Jordan from before the children of Israel when they passed over, that their hearts failed, and they were terror-stricken, and there was no sense in them because of the children of Israel. 
\p
\v 2 And about this time the Lord said to Joshua, Make thee stone knives of sharp stone, and sit down and circumcise the children of Israel the second time. 
\v 3 And Joshua made sharp knives of stone, and circumcised the children of Israel at the place called the Hill of Foreskins. 
\v 4 And \add this is\add* the way in which Joshua purified the children of Israel; as many as were born in the way, and as many as were uncircumcised of them that came out of Egypt, 
\v 5 all these Joshua circumcised; for forty and two years Israel wandered in the wilderness of Mabdaris— 
\v 6 Wherefore most of the fighting men that came out of the land of Egypt, were uncircumcised, who disobeyed the commands of God; concerning whom also he determined that they should not see the land, which the Lord swore to give to their fathers, \add even\add* a land flowing with milk and honey. 
\v 7 And in their place he raised up their sons, whom Joshua circumcised, because they were uncircumcised, having been born by the way. 
\v 8 And when they had been circumcised they rested continuing there in the camp till they were healed. 
\v 9 And the Lord said to Joshua the son of Nun, On this day have I removed the reproach of Egypt from you: and he called the name of that place Gilgal. 
\p
\v 10 And the children of Israel kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, to the westward of Jericho on the opposite side of the Jordan in the plain. 
\v 11 And they ate of the grain of the earth unleavened and new \add corn\add*. 
\v 12 In this day the manna failed, after they had eaten of the corn of the land, and the children of Israel no longer had manna; and they took the fruits of the land of the Phoenicians in that year. 
\p
\v 13 And it came to pass when Joshua was in Jericho, that he looked up with his eyes and saw a man standing before him, and \add there was\add* a drawn sword in his hand; and Joshua drew near and said to him, Art thou for us or on the side of our enemies? 
\v 14 And he said to him, I am now come, the chief captain of the host of the Lord. And Joshua fell on his face upon the earth, and said to him, Lord, what commandest thou thy servant? 
\v 15 And the captain of the Lord’s host said to Joshua, Loose thy shoe off thy feet, for the place whereon thou now standest is holy. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1 Now Jericho was closely shut up and besieged, and none went out of it, and none came in. 
\v 2 And the Lord said to Joshua, Behold, I deliver Jericho into thy power, and its king in it, \add and its\add* mighty men. 
\v 3 And do thou set the men of war round about it. 
\v 5 And it shall be \add that\add* when ye shall sound with the trumpet, all the people shall shout together. And when they have shouted, the walls of the city shall fall of themselves; and all the people shall enter, each one rushing direct into the city. 
\p
\v 6 And Joshua the \add son\add* of Nun went in to the priests, 
\v 7 and spoke to them, saying, Charge the people to go round, and encompass the city; and let your men of war pass on armed before the Lord. 
\v 8 And let seven priests having seven sacred trumpets proceed thus before the Lord, and let them sound loudly; and let the ark of the covenant of the Lord follow. 
\v 9 And let the men of war proceed before, and the priests bringing up the rear behind the ark of the covenant of the Lord \add proceed\add* sounding the trumpets. 
\v 10 And Joshua commanded the people, saying, Cry not out, nor let anyone hear your voice, until he himself declare to you the time to cry out, and then ye shall cry out. 
\v 11 And the ark of the covenant of God having gone round immediately returned into the camp, and lodged there. 
\p
\v 12 And on the second day Joshua rose up in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the covenant of the Lord. 
\v 13 And the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets went on before the Lord; and afterward the men of war went on, and the remainder of the multitude went after the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and the priests sounded with the trumpets. 
\v 14 And all the rest of the multitude compassed the city six times from within a short distance, and went back again into the camp; this they did six days. 
\p
\v 15 And on the seventh day they rose up early, and compassed the city on that day seven times. 
\v 16 And it came to pass at the seventh circuit the priests blew the trumpets; and Joshua said to the children of Israel, Shout, for the Lord has given you the city. 
\v 17 And the city shall be devoted, it and all things that are in it, to the Lord of Hosts: only do ye save Rahab the harlot, and all things in her house. 
\v 18 But keep yourselves strictly from the accursed thing, lest ye set your mind upon and take of the accursed thing, and ye make the camp of the children of Israel an accursed thing, and destroy us. 
\v 19 And all the silver, or gold, or brass, or iron, shall be holy to the Lord; it shall be carried into the treasury of the Lord. 
\p
\v 20 And the priests sounded with the trumpets: and when the people heard the trumpets, all the people shouted at once with a loud and strong shout; and all the wall fell round about, and all the people went up into the city: 
\v 21 and Joshua devoted it to destruction, and all things that were in the city, man and woman, young man and old, and calf and ass, with the edge of the sword. 
\p
\v 22 And Joshua said to the two young men who had acted as spies, Go into the house of the woman, and bring her out thence, and all that she has. 
\v 23 And the two young men who had spied out the city entered into the house of the woman, and brought out Rahab the harlot, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and her kindred, and all that she had; and they set her without the camp of Israel. 
\v 24 And the city was burned with fire with all things that were in it; only of the silver, and gold, and brass, and iron, they gave to be brought into the treasury of the Lord. 
\p
\v 25 And Joshua saved alive Rahab the harlot, and all the house of her father, and caused her to dwell in Israel until this day, because she hid the spies which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho. 
\v 26 And Joshua adjured \add them\add* on that day before the Lord, saying, Cursed \add be\add* the man who shall build that city: he shall lay the foundation of it in his firstborn, and he shall set up the gates of it in his youngest son. And so did Hozan of Bethel; he laid the foundation in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates of it in his youngest surviving son. 
\p
\v 27 And the Lord was with Joshua, and his name was in all the land. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1 But the children of Israel committed a great trespass, and purloined \add part\add* of the accursed thing; and Achan the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing; and the Lord was very angry with the children of Israel. 
\p
\v 2 And Joshua sent men to Ai, which is by Bethel, saying, Spy out Ai: and the men went up and spied Ai. 
\v 3 And they returned to Joshua, and said to him, Let not all the people go up, but let about two or three thousand men go up and take the city by siege: carry not up thither the whole people, for \add the enemy\add* are few. 
\v 4 And there went up about three thousand men, and they fled from before the men of Ai. 
\v 5 And the men of Ai slew of them to the number of thirty-six men, and they pursued them from the gate, and destroyed them from the steep hill; and the heart of the people was alarmed and became as water. 
\p
\v 6 And Joshua tore his garments; and Joshua fell on the earth on his face before the Lord until evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they cast dust on their heads. 
\v 7 And Joshua said, I pray, Lord, wherefore has thy servant brought this people over Jordan to deliver them to the Amorite to destroy us? would we had remained and settled ourselves beyond Jordan. 
\v 8 And what shall I say since Israel has turned his back before his enemy? 
\v 9 And when the Canaanite and all the inhabitants of the land hear it, they shall compass us round and destroy us from off the land: and what wilt thou do \add for\add* thy great name? 
\p
\v 10 And the Lord said to Joshua, Rise up; why hast thou fallen upon thy face? 
\v 11 The people has sinned, and transgressed the covenant which I made with them; they have stolen from the cursed thing, and put it into their store. 
\v 12 And the children of Israel will not be able to stand before their enemies; they will turn their back before their enemies, for they have become an accursed thing: I will not any longer be with you, unless ye remove the cursed thing from yourselves. 
\v 13 Rise, sanctify the people and tell them to sanctify themselves for the morrow: thus says the Lord God of Israel, The accursed thing is among you; ye shall not be able to stand before your enemies, until ye shall have removed the cursed thing from among you. 
\v 14 And ye shall all be gathered together by your tribes in the morning, and it shall come to pass that the tribe which the Lord shall show, ye shall bring by families; and the family which the Lord shall show, ye shall bring by households; and the household which the Lord shall show, ye shall bring man by man. 
\v 15 And the man who shall be pointed out, shall be burned with fire, and all that he has; because he has transgressed the covenant of the Lord, and has wrought wickedness in Israel. 
\p
\v 16 And Joshua rose up early, and brought the people by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was pointed out. 
\v 17 And it was brought by their families, and the family of the Zerahites was pointed out. 
\v 18 And it was brought man by man, and Achan the son of Zabdi the son of Zerah was pointed out. 
\p
\v 19 And Joshua said to Achan, Give glory this day to the Lord God of Israel, and make confession; and tell me what thou hast done, and hide it not from me. 
\v 20 And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the Lord God of Israel: thus and thus have I done: 
\v 21 I saw in the spoil an embroidered mantle, and two hundred didrachmas of silver, and one golden wedge of fifty didrachmas, and I desired them and took them; and, behold, they are hidden in my tent, and the silver is hidden under them. 
\v 22 And Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent into the camp; and these things were hidden in his tent, and the silver under them. 
\v 23 And they brought them out of the tent, and brought them to Joshua and the elders of Israel, and they laid them before the Lord. 
\p
\v 24 And Joshua took Achan the son of Zerah, and brought him to the Valley of Achor, and his sons, and his daughters, and his calves, and his asses, and all his sheep, and his tent, and all his property, and all the people \add were\add* with him; and he brought them to Emec Achor. 
\v 25 And Joshua said to Achan, Why hast thou destroyed us? the Lord destroy thee as at this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones. 
\v 26 And they set up over him a great heap of stones; and the Lord ceased from his fierce anger. Therefore he called the place Emec Achor until this day. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1 And the Lord said to Joshua, Fear not, nor be timorous: take with thee all the men of war, and arise, go up to Ai; behold, I have given into thy hands the king of Ai, and his land. 
\v 2 And thou shalt do to Ai, as thou didst to Jericho and its king; and thou shalt take to thyself the spoil of its cattle; set now for thyself an ambush for the city behind. 
\p
\v 3 And Joshua and all the men of war rose to go up to Ai; and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men, and he sent them away by night. 
\v 4 And he charged them, saying, Do ye lie in ambush behind the city: do not go far from the city, and ye shall all be ready. 
\v 5 And I and all with me will draw near to the city: and it shall come to pass when the inhabitants of Ai shall come forth to meet us, as before, that we will flee from before them. 
\v 6 And when they shall come out after us, we will draw them away from the city; and they will say, These men flee from before us, as also before. 
\v 7 And ye shall rise up out of the ambuscade, and go into the city. 
\v 8 Ye shall do according to this word, lo! I have commanded you. 
\v 9 And Joshua sent them, and they went to lie in ambush; and they lay between Bethel and Ai, westward of Ai. 
\p
\v 10 And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people; and he went up, he and the elders before the people to Ai. 
\v 11 And all the men of war went up with him, and they went forward and came over against the city eastward. 
\v 12 And the ambuscade \add was\add* on the west side of the city. 
\v 14 And it came to pass when the king of Ai saw \add it\add*, he hastened and went out to meet them direct to the battle, he and all the people \add that were\add* with him: and he knew not that there was an ambuscade \add formed\add* against him behind the city. 
\v 15 And Joshua and Israel saw, and retreated from before them. 
\v 16 And they pursued after the children of Israel, and they themselves went to a distance from the city. 
\v 17 There was no one left in Ai who did not pursue after Israel; and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel. 
\p
\v 18 And the Lord said to Joshua, Stretch forth thy hand with the spear that is in thy hand toward the city, for I have delivered it into thy hands; and the liers in wait shall rise up quickly out of their place. 
\v 19 And Joshua stretched out his hand \add and\add* his spear toward the city, and the ambuscade rose up quickly out of their place; and they came forth when he stretched out his hand; and they entered into the city, and took it; and they hastened and burned the city with fire. 
\p
\v 20 And when the inhabitants of Ai looked round behind them, then they saw the smoke going up out of the city to heaven, and they were no longer able to flee this way or that way. 
\v 21 And Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambuscade had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city went up to heaven; and they turned and smote the men of Ai. 
\v 22 And these came forth out of the city to meet them; and they were in the midst of the army, some \add being\add* on this side, and some on that; and they smote them until there was not left of them one who survived and escaped. 
\v 23 And they took the king of Ai alive, and brought him to Joshua. 
\p
\v 24 And when the children of Israel had ceased slaying all that were in Ai, and in the fields, and in the mountain on the descent, from whence they pursued them \add even\add* to the end, then Joshua returned to Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword. 
\v 25 And they that fell in that day, men and women, were twelve thousand: \add they slew\add* all the inhabitants of Ai. 
\v 27 Beside the spoils that were in the city, all things which the children of Israel took as spoil for themselves according to the command of the Lord, as the Lord commanded Joshua. 
\p
\v 28 And Joshua burned the city with fire: he made it an uninhabited heap forever, \add even\add* to this day. 
\v 29 And he hanged the king of Ai on a gallows; and he remained on the tree till evening: and when the sun went down, Joshua gave charge, and they took down his body from the tree, and cast it into a pit, and they set over him a heap of stones until this day. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 And when the kings of the Amorites on the other side of Jordan, who were in the mountain country, and in the plain, and in all the coast of the great sea, and those who were near Antilebanon, and the Hittites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Amorites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites, heard \add of it\add*, 
\v 2 they came all together at the same time to make war against Joshua and Israel. 
\p
\v 2a Then Joshua built an altar to the Lord God of Israel in Mount Ebal, 
\v 2b as Moses the servant of the Lord commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the law of Moses, an altar of unhewn stones, on which iron had not been lifted up; and he offered there whole burnt offerings to the Lord, and a peace offering. 
\v 2c And Joshua wrote upon the stones a copy of the law, \add even\add* the law of Moses, before the children of Israel. 
\v 2d And all Israel, and their elders, and their judges, and their scribes, passed on one side and on the other before the ark; and the priests and the Levites took up the ark of the covenant of the Lord; and the stranger and the native \add were there\add*, who were half of them near Mount Gerizim, and half near Mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of the Lord commanded at first, to bless the people. 
\p
\v 2e And afterward Joshua read accordingly all the words of this law, the blessings and the curses, according to all things written in the law of Moses. 
\v 2f There was not a word of all that Moses charged Joshua, which Joshua read not in the ears of all the assembly of the children of Israel, the men, and the women, and the children, and the strangers that joined themselves to Israel. 
\p
\v 3 And the inhabitants of Gibeon heard of all that the Lord did to Jericho and Ai. 
\v 4 And they also wrought craftily, and they went and made provision and prepared themselves; and having taken old sacks on their shoulders, and old and rent and patched bottles of wine, 
\v 5 and the upper part of their shoes and their sandals old and clouted on their feet, and their garments old upon them—and the bread of their provision was dry and moldy and corrupt. 
\p
\v 6 And they came to Joshua into the camp of Israel to Gilgal, and said to Joshua and Israel, We are come from a far land: now then make a covenant with us. 
\v 7 And the children of Israel said to the Horite, Peradventure thou dwellest amongst us; and how should I make a covenant with thee? 
\v 8 And they said to Joshua, We are thy servants: and Joshua said to them, Whence are ye, and whence have ye come? 
\v 9 And they said, Thy servants are come from a very far country in the name of the Lord thy God: for we have heard his name, and all that he did in Egypt, 
\v 10 and all that he did to the kings of the Amorites, who were beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, who dwelt in Ashtaroth and in Edrei. 
\v 11 And our elders and all that inhabit our land when they heard spoke to us, saying, Take to yourselves provision for the way, and go to meet them; and ye shall say to them, We are thy servants, and now make a covenant with us. 
\v 12 These \add are\add* the loaves—we took them hot for our journey on the day on which we came out to come to you; and now they are dried and become moldy. 
\v 13 And these \add are\add* the skins of wine which we filled when new, and they are rent; and our garments and our shoes are worn out because of the very long journey. 
\p
\v 14 And the chiefs took of their provision, and asked not \add counsel of\add* the Lord. 
\v 15 And Joshua made peace with them, and they made a covenant with them to preserve them; and the princes of the congregation swore to them. 
\p
\v 16 And it came to pass three days after they had made a covenant with them, they heard that they were near neighbors, and that they dwelt among them. 
\v 17 And the children of Israel departed and came to their cities; and their cities \add were\add* Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and the cities of Jearim. 
\v 18 And the children of Israel fought not with them, because all the princes swore to them by the Lord God of Israel; and all the congregation murmured at the princes. 
\p
\v 19 And the princes said to all the congregation: We have sworn to them by the Lord God of Israel, and now we shall not be able to touch them. 
\v 20 This we will do; take them alive, and we will preserve them: so there shall not be wrath against us by reason of the oath which we swore to them. 
\v 21 They shall live, and shall be hewers of wood and drawers of water to all the congregation, as the princes said to them. 
\p
\v 22 And Joshua called them together and said to them, Why have ye deceived me, saying, We live very far from you; whereas ye are fellow countrymen of those who dwell among us? 
\v 23 And now ye are cursed: there shall not fail of you a slave, or a hewer of wood, or a drawer of water to me and my God. 
\v 24 And they answered Joshua, saying, It was reported to us what the Lord thy God charged his servant Moses, to give you this land, and to destroy us and all that dwelt on it from before you; and we feared very much for our lives because of you, and \add therefore\add* we did this thing. 
\v 25 And now, behold, we \add are\add* in your power; do to us as it is pleasing to you, and as it seems \add good\add* to you. 
\p
\v 26 And they did so to them; and Joshua rescued them in that day out of the hands of the children of Israel, and they did not slay them. 
\v 27 And Joshua made them in that day hewers of wood and drawers of water to the whole congregation, and for the altar of God: therefore the inhabitants of Gibeon became hewers of wood and drawers of water for the altar of God until this day, even for the place which the Lord should choose. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1 And when Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had taken Ai, and had destroyed it, as he did to Jericho and its king, even so they did to Ai and its king, and that the inhabitants of Gibeon had gone over to Joshua and Israel; 
\v 2 then they were greatly terrified by them, for \add the king\add* knew that Gibeon \add was\add* a great city, as one of the chief cities, and all its men \add were\add* mighty. 
\v 3 So Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Elam king of Hebron, and to Piram king of Jarmuth, and to Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Adullam, saying, 
\v 4 Come up hither to me, and help me, and let us take Gibeon; for the Gibeonites have gone over to Joshua and to the children of Israel. 
\v 5 And the five kings of the Jebusites went up, the king of Jerusalem, and the king of Hebron, and the king of Jarmuth, and the king of Lachish, and the king of Adullam, they and all their people; and encamped around Gibeon, and besieged it. 
\p
\v 6 And the inhabitants of Gibeon sent to Joshua into the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hands from thy servants: come up quickly to us, and help us, and rescue us; for all the kings of the Amorites who dwell in the hill country are gathered together against us. 
\v 7 And Joshua went up from Gilgal, he and all the people of war with him, every one mighty in strength. 
\p
\v 8 And the Lord said to Joshua, Fear them not, for I have delivered them into thy hands; there shall not one of them be left before you. 
\p
\v 9 And when Joshua came suddenly upon them, he \add had\add* advanced all the night out of Gilgal. 
\v 10 And the Lord struck them with terror before the children of Israel; and the Lord destroyed them with a great slaughter at Gibeon; and they pursued them by the way of the going up of Horon, and they smote them to Azekah and to Makkedah. 
\v 11 And when they fled from the face of the children of Israel at the descent of Horon, then the Lord cast upon them hailstones from heaven to Azekah; and they were more that died by the hailstones, than those whom the children of Israel slew with the sword in the battle. 
\p
\v 12 Then Joshua spoke to the Lord, in the day in which the Lord delivered the Amorite into the power of Israel, when he destroyed them in Gibeon, and they were destroyed from before the children of Israel: and Joshua said, 
\q1 Let the sun stand over against Gibeon, 
\q1 And the moon over against the Valley of Aijalon. 
\q1
\v 13 And the sun and the moon stood still, 
\q1 Until God executed vengeance on their enemies; 
\m and the sun stood still in the midst of heaven; it did not proceed to set till the end of one day. 
\v 14 And there was not such a day either before or after, so that God should hearken to a man, because the Lord fought on the side of Israel. 
\p
\v 16 And these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave that is in Makkedah. 
\v 17 And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings have been found hidden in the cave that is in Makkedah. 
\v 18 And Joshua said, Roll stones to the mouth of the cave, and set men to watch over them. 
\v 19 But do not ye stand, but pursue after your enemies, and attack the rear of them, and do not suffer them to enter into their cities; for the Lord our God has delivered them into our hands. 
\v 20 And it came to pass when Joshua and all Israel ceased destroying them utterly with a very great slaughter, that they that escaped took refuge in the strong cities. 
\p
\v 21 And all the people returned safe to Joshua to Makkedah; and no one of the children of Israel murmured with his tongue. 
\p
\v 22 And Joshua said, Open the cave, and bring out these five kings out of the cave. 
\v 23 And they brought out the five kings out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, and the king of Hebron, and the king of Jarmuth, and the king of Lachish, and the king of Adullam. 
\v 24 And when they brought them out to Joshua, then Joshua called together all Israel, and the chiefs of the army that went with him, saying to them, Come forward and set your feet on their necks; and they came and set their feet on their necks. 
\v 25 And Joshua said to them, Do not fear them, neither be cowardly; be courageous and strong, for thus the Lord will do to all your enemies, against whom ye fight. 
\v 26 And Joshua slew them, and hanged them on five trees; and they hung upon the trees until the evening. 
\v 27 And it came to pass toward the setting of the sun, Joshua commanded, and they took them down from the trees, and cast them into the cave into which they \add had\add* fled for refuge, and rolled stones to the cave, \add which remain\add* till this day. 
\p
\v 28 And they took Makkedah on that day, and slew the inhabitants with the edge of the sword, and they utterly destroyed every living thing that was in it; and there was none left in it that was preserved and had escaped; and they did to the king of Makkedah, as they did to the king of Jericho. 
\p
\v 29 And Joshua and all Israel with him departed out of Makkedah to Libnah, and besieged Libnah. 
\v 30 And the Lord delivered it into the hands of Israel: and they took it, and its king, and slew the inhabitants with the edge of the sword, and everything breathing in it; and there was not left in it any that survived and escaped; and they did to its king, as they did to the king of Jericho. 
\p
\v 31 And Joshua and all Israel with him departed from Libnah to Lachish, and he encamped about it, and besieged it. 
\v 32 And the Lord delivered Lachish into the hands of Israel; and they took it on the second day, and they put the inhabitants to death with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed it, as they had done to Libnah. 
\v 33 Then Elam the king of Gezer went up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people with the edge of the sword, until there was not left to him one that was preserved and escaped. 
\p
\v 34 And Joshua and all Israel with him departed from Lachish to Adullam, and he besieged it and took it. 
\v 35 And the Lord delivered it into the hand of Israel; and he took it on that day, and slew the inhabitants with the edge of the sword, and slew everything breathing in it, as they did to Lachish. 
\p
\v 36 And Joshua and all Israel with him departed to Hebron, and encamped about it. 
\v 37 And he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the living creatures that were in it; there was no one preserved: they destroyed it and all things in it, as they did to Adullam. 
\p
\v 38 And Joshua and all Israel returned to Debir; and they encamped about it; 
\v 39 and they took it, and its king, and its villages: and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and they destroyed it, and everything breathing in it; and they did not leave in it anyone that was preserved: as they did to Hebron and her king, so they did to Debir and her king. 
\p
\v 40 And Joshua smote all the land of the hill country, and Negeb and the plain country, and Asedoth, and her kings, they did not leave of them one that was saved: and they utterly destroyed everything that had the breath of life, as the Lord God of Israel commanded, 
\v 41 from Kadesh-barnea to Gaza, all Goshen, as far as Gibeon. 
\v 42 And Joshua smote, once for all, all their kings, and their land, because the Lord God of Israel fought on the side of Israel. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 And when Jabin the king of Hazor heard, he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph, 
\v 2 and to the kings who were by the great Sidon, to the hill country and to Arabah opposite Chinneroth, and to the plain, and to Naphoth-dor, 
\v 3 and to the Canaanites on the coast eastward, and to the Amorites on the coast, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites in the mountain, and the Hivites, and those dwelling under \add Mount\add* Hermon in the land Mizpah. 
\v 4 And they and their kings with them went forth, as the sand of the sea in multitude, and horses, and very many chariots. 
\v 5 And all the kings assembled in person, and came to the same place, and encamped at the waters of Merom to war with Israel. 
\p
\v 6 And the Lord said to Joshua, Be not afraid of them, for tomorrow \add at\add* this time I will put them to flight before Israel: thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their chariots with fire. 
\v 7 And Joshua and all the men of war came upon them at the water of Merom suddenly; and they attacked them in the hill country. 
\v 8 And the Lord delivered them into the power of Israel; and they smote them and pursued them to great Sidon, and to Misrephoth, and to the plains of Mizpeh eastward; and they destroyed them till there was not one of them left that survived. 
\v 9 And Joshua did to them, as the Lord commanded him: he houghed their horses, and burned their chariots with fire. 
\p
\v 10 And Joshua returned at that time, and took Hazor and her king; now Hazor in former time was the chief of these kingdoms. 
\v 11 And they slew with the sword all that breathed in it, and utterly destroyed them all, and there was no living thing left in it; and they burned Hazor with fire. 
\v 12 And Joshua took all the cities of the kingdoms, and their kings, and slew them with the edge of the sword; and utterly slew them, as Moses the servant of the Lord commanded. 
\v 13 But all the walled cities Israel burned not; but Israel burned Hazor only. 
\v 14 And the children of Israel took all its spoils to themselves; and they slew all the men with the edge of the sword, until he destroyed them; they left not one of them breathing. 
\v 15 As the Lord commanded his servant Moses, even so Moses commanded Joshua; and so Joshua did, he transgressed no precept of all that Moses commanded him. 
\p
\v 16 And Joshua took all the hill country, and all the land of Negeb, and all the land of Goshen, and the plain country, and that toward the west, and the mountain of Israel and the low country by the mountain; 
\v 17 from the mountain of Halak, and that which goes up to Seir, and as far as Baal-gad, and the plains of Lebanon, under Mount Hermon; and he took all their kings, and destroyed, and slew them. 
\v 18 And for many days Joshua waged war with these kings. 
\p
\v 19 And there was no city which Israel took not; they took all in war. 
\v 20 For it was of the Lord to harden their hearts to go forth to war against Israel, that they might be utterly destroyed, that mercy should not be granted to them, but that they should be utterly destroyed, as the Lord said to Moses. 
\p
\v 21 And Joshua came at that time, and utterly destroyed the Anakim out of the hill country, from Hebron and from Debir, and from Anab, and from all the race of Israel, and from all the mountain of Judah with their cities; and Joshua utterly destroyed them. 
\v 22 There was not \add anyone\add* left of the Anakim by the children of Israel, only there was left of them in Gaza, and in Gath, and in Ashdod. 
\p
\v 23 And Joshua took all the land, as the Lord commanded Moses; and Joshua gave them for an inheritance to Israel by division according to their tribes; and the land ceased from war. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 And these \add are\add* the kings of the land, whom the children of Israel slew, and inherited their land beyond Jordan from the east, from the Valley of Arnon to the mount of Hermon, and all the land of Arabah on the east. 
\v 2 Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, ruling from Arnon, which is in the valley, on the side of the valley, and half of Gilead as far as Jabbok, the borders of the children of Ammon. 
\v 3 And Arabah as far as the Sea of Chinneroth eastward, and as far as the Sea of Arabah; the salt sea eastward \add by\add* the way to Jeshimoth, from Thaeman under Asedoth Pisgah. 
\v 4 And Og king of Bashan, who dwelt in Ashtaroth and in Edrei, was left of the giants 
\v 5 ruling from Mount Hermon and from Salecah, and \add over\add* all the land of Bashan to the borders of Geshur, and Maacath, and the half of Gilead of the borders of Sihon king of Heshbon. 
\v 6 Moses the servant of the Lord and the children of Israel smote them; and Moses gave them by way of inheritance to Reuben, and Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh. 
\p
\v 7 And these \add are\add* the kings of the Amorites, whom Joshua and the children of Israel slew beyond Jordan by the Sea of Baal-gad in the plain of Lebanon, and as far as the mountain of Halak, as men go up to Seir: and Joshua gave it to the tribes of Israel to inherit according to their portion; 
\v 8 in the mountain, and in the plain, and in Arabah, and in Asedoth, and in the wilderness, and Negeb; the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite. 
\p
\v 9 The king of Jericho, and the king of Ai, which is near Bethel; 
\v 10 the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, 
\v 11 the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish; 
\v 12 the king of Eglon, the king of Gezer; 
\v 13 the king of Debir, the king of Geder: 
\v 14 the king of Hormah, the king of Arad; 
\v 15 the king of Libnah, the king of Adullam, 
\v 16 the king of Elath, 
\v 17 the king of Tappuah, the king of Hepher, 
\v 18 the king of Aphek of Aroc, 
\v 19 the king of Hazor, 
\v 20 the king of Shimron, the king of Mambroth, the king of Achshaph, 
\v 21 the king of Kedesh, the king of Zachac, 
\v 22 the king of Maredoth, the king of Jokneam of Carmel, 
\v 23 the king of Adullam \add belonging to\add* Naphath-dor, the king of Goiim of Galilee: 
\v 24 the king of Tirzah: all these \add were\add* twenty-nine kings. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 And Joshua \add was\add* old and very advanced in years; and the Lord said to Joshua, Thou art advanced in years, and there is much land left to inherit. 
\v 2 And this \add is\add* the land that is left: the borders of the Philistines, the Geshurite, and the Canaanite, 
\v 3 from the wilderness before Egypt, as far as the borders of Ekron on the left of the Canaanites \add the land\add* is reckoned to the five principalities of the Philistines, to the inhabitant of Gaza, and of Ashdod, and of Ashkelon, and of Gath, and of Ekron, and to the Avvim; 
\v 4 from Thaeman even to all the land of Canaan before Gaza, and the Sidonians as far as Aphek, as far as the borders of the Amorites. 
\v 5 And all the land of Galiath of the Philistines, and all Lebanon eastward from Baal-gad, under the mountain Hermon as far as the entering in of Hamath; 
\v 6 everyone that inhabits the hill country from Lebanon as far as Misrephoth-maim. All the Sidonians, I will destroy them from before Israel; but do thou give them by inheritance to Israel, as I charged thee. 
\p
\v 7 And now divide this land by lot to the nine tribes, and to the half tribe of Manasseh. 
\v 8 From Jordan to the great sea westward thou shalt give it \add them\add*: the great sea shall be the boundary. \add But\add* to the two tribes and to the half tribe of Manasseh, to Reuben and to Gad Moses gave \add an inheritance\add* beyond Jordan: Moses the servant of the Lord gave \add it\add* to them eastward, 
\v 9 from Aroer, which is on the bank of the brook of Arnon, and the city in the midst of the valley, and all Misor from Medeba. 
\v 10 All the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned from Heshbon to the coasts of the children of Ammon; 
\v 11 and the region of Gilead, and the borders of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, the whole mount of Hermon, and all the land of Bashan to Salecah. 
\v 12 All the kingdom of Og in the region of Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei: he was left of the giants; and Moses smote him, and destroyed him. 
\v 13 But the children of Israel destroyed not the Geshurite and the Maacathite and the Canaanite; and the king of the Geshurite and the Maacathite dwelt among the children of Israel until this day. 
\p
\v 14 Only no inheritance was given to the tribe of Levi: the Lord God of Israel, he \add is\add* their inheritance, as the Lord said to them; and this \add is\add* the division which Moses made to the children of Israel in Araboth Moab, on the other side of Jordan, by Jericho. 
\p
\v 15 And Moses gave the land to the tribe of Reuben according to their families. 
\v 16 And their borders were from Aroer, which is opposite the brook of Arnon, and \add theirs is\add* the city that is in the Valley of Arnon; and all Misor, 
\v 17 to Heshbon, and all the cities in Misor, and Dibon, and Bamoth-baal, and the house of Baal-meon; 
\v 18 and Bashan, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath, 
\v 19 and Kiriathaim, and Sibmah, and Zereth, and Sion in Mount Enab; 
\v 20 and Beth-peor, and Asedoth Pisgah, and Beth-jeshimoth, 
\v 21 and all the cities of Misor, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, whom Moses smote, even him and the princes of Midian, and Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba prince of the spoils of Sihon, and the inhabitants of Sihon. 
\p
\v 22 And Balaam the son of Beor the prophet they slew in the battle. 
\p
\v 23 And the borders of Reuben were—\add even\add* Jordan \add was the\add* boundary; this \add is\add* the inheritance of the children of Reuben according to their families, \add these were\add* their cities and their villages. 
\p
\v 24 And Moses gave inheritance to the sons of Gad according to their families. 
\v 25 And their borders were Jazer, all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon to Aroer, which is before Arad. 
\v 26 And from Heshbon to Araboth by Mizpeh, and Betonim, and Mahanaim to the borders of Debir, 
\v 27 and Enadom, and Beth-haram, and Beth-nimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, and the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon: and Jordan shall be the boundary as far as part of the Sea of Chinnereth beyond Jordan eastward. 
\v 28 This \add is\add* the inheritance of the children of Gad according to their families and according to their cities: according to their families they will turn their backs before their enemies, because their cities and their villages were according to their families. 
\p
\v 29 And Moses gave to half the tribe of Manasseh according to their families. 
\v 30 And their borders were from Mahanaim, and all the kingdom of Bashan, and all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the villages of Jair, which are in the region of Bashan, sixty cities: 
\v 31 and the half of Gilead, and in Ashtaroth, and in Edrei, royal cities of Og in the land of Bashan, \add Moses gave\add* to the sons of Machir the sons of Manasseh, even to the half-tribe sons of Machir the sons of Manasseh, according to their families. 
\v 32 These \add are\add* they whom Moses caused to inherit beyond Jordan in Araboth Moab, beyond Jordan by Jericho eastward. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1 And these \add are\add* they of the children of Israel that received their inheritance in the land of Canaan, to whom Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the \add son\add* of Nun, and the heads of the families of the tribes of the children of Israel, gave inheritance. 
\v 2 They inherited according to their lots, as the Lord commanded by the hand of Joshua to the nine tribes and the half tribe, on the other side of Jordan. 
\v 3 But to the Levites he gave no inheritance among them. 
\v 4 For the sons of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim; and there was none inheritance in the land given to the Levites, only cities to dwell in, and their suburbs separated for the cattle, and their cattle. 
\v 5 As the Lord commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel; and they divided the land. 
\p
\v 6 And the children of Judah came to Joshua in Gilgal, and Caleb the \add son\add* of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, Thou knowest the word that the Lord spoke to Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Kadesh-barnea. 
\v 7 For I was forty years old when Moses the servant of God sent me out of Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land; and I returned him an answer according to his mind. 
\v 8 My brethren that went up with me turned away the heart of the people, but I applied myself to follow the Lord my God. 
\v 9 And Moses swore on that day, saying, The land on which thou art gone up, it shall be thy inheritance and thy children’s forever, because thou hast applied thyself to follow the Lord our God. 
\v 10 And now the Lord has kept me alive as he said: this \add is\add* the forty-fifth year since the Lord spoke that word to Moses; and Israel journeyed in the wilderness; and now, behold, I \add am\add* this day eighty-five years old. 
\v 11 I am still strong this day, as when the Lord sent me: just so strong am I now to go out and to come in for war. 
\v 12 And now I ask of thee this mountain, as the Lord said in that day; for thou heardest this word on that day; and now the Anakim are there, cities great and strong: if then the Lord should be with me, I will utterly destroy them, as the Lord said to me. 
\p
\v 13 And Joshua blessed him, and gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh the son of Kenaz for an inheritance. 
\v 14 Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the \add son\add* of Jephunneh the Kenizzite until this day, because he followed the commandment of the Lord God of Israel. 
\v 15 And the name of Hebron before was the city Arba, it \add is\add* the metropolis of the Anakim: and the land rested from war. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1 And the borders of the tribe of Judah according to their families were from the borders of Edom from the wilderness of Zin, as far as Kadesh southward. 
\p
\v 2 And their borders were from the south as far as a part of the salt sea from the high country that extends southward. 
\v 3 And they proceed before the ascent of Akrabbim, and go out round Zin, and go up from the south to Kadesh-barnea; and go out to Hezron, and proceed up to Addar, and go out by the way that is west of Kadesh. 
\v 4 And they go out to Azmon, and issue at the Valley of Egypt; and the termination of its boundaries shall be at the sea: these are their boundaries southward. 
\p
\v 5 And their boundaries eastward \add are\add* all the salt sea as far as Jordan; and their borders from the north, and from the border of the sea, and from part of Jordan— 
\v 6 the borders go up to Beth-hoglah, and they go along from the north to Beth-arabah, and the borders go on up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben. 
\v 7 And the borders continue on to the fourth part of the Valley of Achor, and go down to Gilgal, which is before the approach of Adummim, which is southward in the valley, and terminate at the water of the fountain of the sun; and their going forth shall be the fountain of Rogel. 
\v 8 And the borders go up to the Valley of Hinnom, behind Jebus southward; this is Jerusalem: and the borders terminate at the top of the mountain, which is before the Valley of Hinnom toward the sea, which is by the side of the land of Rephaim northward. 
\v 9 And the border \add going forth\add* from the top of the mountain terminates at the fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and terminates at Mount Ephron; and the border will lead to Baalah; this is the city of Jearim.

\v 18 And it came to pass as she went out that she counseled him, saying, I will ask of my father a field; and she cried from off her ass; and Caleb said to her, What is it?

\c 17  
\p
\v 1 And the borders of the tribe of the children of Manasseh (for he \add was\add* the firstborn of Joseph), \add assigned\add* to Machir the firstborn of Manasseh the father of Gilead, for he was a warrior, \add were\add* in the land of Gilead and of Bashan.

\v 3 And Zelophehad the son of Hepher had no sons but daughters: and these \add are\add* the names of the daughters of Zelophehad; Mahlah, and Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah. 
\v 4 And they stood before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua, and before the rulers, saying, God gave a charge by the hand of Moses, to give us an inheritance in the midst of our brethren: so there was given to them by the command of the Lord an inheritance among the brethren of their father. 
\v 5 And their lot fell \add to them\add* from Manasseh, and \add to the\add* plain of Labec of the land of Gilead, which is beyond Jordan.

\v 12 And the sons of Manasseh were not able to destroy these cities; and the Canaanite began to dwell in that land. 
\v 13 And it came to pass that when the children of Israel were strong, they made the Canaanites subject, but they did not utterly destroy them. 
\p
\v 14 And the sons of Joseph answered Joshua, saying, Wherefore hast thou caused us to inherit one inheritance, and one line? whereas I am a great people, and God has blessed me. 
\v 15 And Joshua said to them, If thou be a great people, go up to the forest, and clear \add the land\add* for thyself, if Mount Ephraim be too little for thee. 
\v 16 And they said, The mount of Ephraim does not please us, and the Canaanite dwelling in it in Beth-shean, and in its villages, \add and\add* in the Valley of Jezreel, has choice cavalry and iron. 
\v 17 And Joshua said to the sons of Joseph, If thou art a great people, and hast great strength, thou shalt not have \add only\add* one inheritance. 
\v 18 For thou shalt have the wood, for there is a wood, and thou shalt clear it, and \add the land\add* shall be thine; even when thou shalt have utterly destroyed the Canaanite, for he has chosen cavalry; yet thou art stronger than he. 
\c 18

\p
\v 2 And the sons of Israel remained, \add even\add* those who \add had\add* not received their inheritance, seven tribes. 
\v 3 And Joshua said to the sons of Israel, How long will ye be slack to inherit the land, which the Lord our God has given you? 
\v 4 Appoint of yourselves three men of each tribe, and let them rise up and go through the land, and let them describe it before me, as it will be proper to divide it. 
\v 5 And they came to him: and he divided to them seven portions, \add saying\add*, Judah shall stand to them a border southward, and the sons of Joseph shall stand to them northward. 
\v 6 And do ye divide the land into seven parts, and bring the description hither to me, and I will give you a lot before the Lord our God. 
\v 7 For the sons of Levi have no part among you; for the priesthood of the Lord \add is\add* his portion; and Gad, and Reuben, and the half tribe of Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond Jordan eastward, which Moses the servant of the Lord gave to them. 
\p
\v 8 And the men rose up and went; and Joshua charged the men who went to explore the land, saying, Go and explore the land, and come to me, and I will bring you forth a lot here before the Lord in Shiloh. 
\v 9 And they went, and explored the land: and they viewed it, and described it according to the cities, seven parts in a book, and brought \add the book\add* to Joshua. 
\v 10 And Joshua cast the lot for them in Shiloh before the Lord.

\v 34 And to the family of the sons of Merari the Levites that remained, \add he gave\add* out of the tribe of Zebulun, Maan and its suburbs; and Kadesh and its suburbs, 
\v 35 and Sella and its suburbs: three cities. 
\v 36 And beyond Jordan over against Jericho, out of the tribe of Reuben, the city of refuge for the slayer, Bezer in the wilderness; Miso and its suburbs; and Jahaz and its suburbs; 
\v 37 and Kedemoth and its suburbs; and Mephaath and its suburbs; four cities. 
\v 38 And out of the tribe of Gad the city of refuge for the slayer, both Ramoth in Gilead, and its suburbs; Camin and its suburbs; 
\v 39 and Heshbon and its suburbs; and Jazer and its suburbs: the cities \add were\add* four in all. 
\v 40 All \add these\add* cities \add were given\add* to the sons of Merari according to the families of them that were left out of the tribe of Levi; and their limits were the twelve cities. 
\p
\v 41 All the cities of the Levites in the midst of the possession of the children of Israel, \add were\add* forty-eight cities, 
\v 42 and their suburbs round about these cities: a city and the suburbs round about the city to all these cities: 
\v 42a and Joshua ceased dividing the land by their borders: 
\v 42b and the children of Israel gave a portion to Joshua because of the commandment of the Lord: they gave him the city which he asked: they gave him Timnath-serah in Mount Ephraim; 
\v 42c and Joshua built the city, and dwelt in it: 
\v 42d and Joshua took the knives of stone, wherewith he circumcised the children of Israel that were born in the desert by the way, and put them in Timnath-serah. 
\p
\v 43 So the Lord gave to Israel all the land which he swore to give to their fathers: and they inherited it, and dwelt in it. 
\v 44 And the Lord gave them rest round about, as he swore to their fathers: not one of all their enemies maintained his ground against them; the Lord delivered all their enemies into their hands. 
\v 45 There failed not one of the good things which the Lord spoke to the children of Israel; all came to pass. 
\c 22  
\p
\v 1 Then Joshua called together the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh, 
\v 2 and said to them, Ye have heard all that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you, and ye have hearkened to my voice in all that he commanded you. 
\v 3 Ye have not deserted your brethren these many days: until this day ye have kept the commandment of the Lord your God. 
\v 4 And now the Lord our God has given our brethren rest, as he told them: now then return and depart to your homes, and to the land of your possession, which Moses gave you on the other side Jordan. 
\v 5 But take great heed to do the commands and the law, which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you to do; to love the Lord our God, to walk in all his ways, to keep his commands, and to cleave to him, and serve him with all your mind, and with all your soul. 
\v 6 And Joshua blessed them, and dismissed them; and they went to their homes. 
\p
\v 7 And to \add one\add* half the tribe of Manasseh Moses gave a portion in the land of Bashan, and to \add the other\add* half Joshua gave a portion with his brethren on the other side of Jordan westward: and when Joshua sent them away to their homes, then he blessed them. 
\v 8 And they departed with much wealth to their houses, and they divided the spoil of their enemies with their brethren; very much cattle, and silver, and gold, and iron, and much raiment. 
\p
\v 9 So the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh, departed from the children of Israel in Shiloh in the land of Canaan, to go away into Gilead, into the land of their possession, which they inherited by the command of the Lord, by the hand of Moses. 
\p
\v 10 And they came to Gilead of Jordan, which is in the land of Canaan: and the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan, a great altar to look at. 
\p
\v 11 And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an altar at the borders of the land of Canaan at Gilead of Jordan, on the opposite side to the children of Israel. 
\v 12 And all the children of Israel gathered together to Shiloh, so as to go up and fight against them. 
\p
\v 13 And the children of Israel sent to the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and to the sons of the half tribe of Manasseh into the land of Gilead, both Phinehas the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, 
\v 14 and ten of the chiefs with him; \add there was\add* one chief of every household out of all the tribes of Israel (the heads of families are the captains of thousands in Israel). 
\v 15 And they came to the sons of Reuben, and to the sons of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh into the land of Gilead; and they spoke to them, saying, 
\v 16 Thus says the whole congregation of the Lord, What \add is\add* this transgression that ye have transgressed before the God of Israel, to turn away today from the Lord, in that ye have built for yourselves an altar, so that ye should be apostates from the Lord? 
\v 17 Is the sin of Peor too little for you, whereas we have not been cleansed from it until this day, though there was a plague among the congregation of the Lord? 
\v 18 And ye have this day revolted from the Lord; and it shall come to pass if ye revolt this day from the Lord, that tomorrow there shall be wrath upon all Israel. 
\v 19 And now if the land of your possession \add be too\add* little, cross over to the land of the possession of the Lord, where the tabernacle of the Lord dwells, and receive ye an inheritance among us; and do not become apostates from God, neither do ye apostatize from the Lord, because of your having built an altar apart from the altar of the Lord our God. 
\v 20 Lo! did not Achan the \add son\add* of Zerah commit a trespass \add taking\add* of the accursed thing, and there was wrath on the whole congregation of Israel? and he himself died alone in his own sin. 
\p
\v 21 And the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh answered, and spoke to the captains of the thousands of Israel, saying, 
\v 22 God \add even\add* God is the Lord, and God \add even\add* God himself knows, and Israel he shall know; if we have transgressed before the Lord by apostasy, let him not deliver us this day. 
\v 23 And if we have built to ourselves an altar, so as to apostatize from the Lord our God, so as to offer upon it a sacrifice of whole burnt offerings, so as to offer upon it a sacrifice of peace offering—the Lord shall require it. 
\p
\v 24 But we have done this for the sake of precaution \add concerning this\add* thing, saying, Lest hereafter your sons should say to our sons, What have ye to do with the Lord God of Israel? 
\v 25 Whereas the Lord has set boundaries between us and you, even Jordan, and ye have no portion in the Lord: so your sons shall alienate our sons, that they should not worship the Lord. 
\v 26 And we gave orders to do thus, to build this altar, not for burnt offerings, nor for meat offerings; 
\v 27 but that this may be a witness between you and us, and between our posterity after us, that we may do service to the Lord before him, with our burnt offerings and our meat offerings and our peace offerings: so your sons shall not say to our sons, hereafter, Ye have no portion in the Lord. 
\v 28 And we said, If ever it should come to pass that they should speak \add so\add* to us, or to our posterity hereafter; then shall they say, Behold the likeness of the altar of the Lord, which our fathers made, not for the sake of burnt offerings, nor for the sake of meat offerings, but it is a witness between you and us, and between our sons. 
\v 29 Far be it from us therefore that we should turn away from the Lord this day so as to apostatize from the Lord, so as that we should build an altar for burnt offerings, and for peace offerings, besides the altar of the Lord which is before his tabernacle. 
\p
\v 30 And Phinehas the priest and all the chiefs of the congregation of Israel who were with him heard the words which the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh spoke; and it pleased them. 
\v 31 And Phinehas the priest said to the sons of Reuben, and to the sons of Gad, and to the half of the tribe of Manasseh, Today we know that the Lord \add is\add* with us, because ye have not trespassed grievously against the Lord, and because ye have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the Lord. 
\v 32 So Phinehas the priest and the princes departed from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, and from the half tribe of Manasseh out of Gilead into the land of Canaan to the children of Israel; and reported the words to them. 
\v 33 And it pleased the children of Israel; and they spoke to the children of Israel, and blessed the God of the children of Israel, and told them to go up no more to war against the others to destroy the land of the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh: so they dwelt upon it. 
\p
\v 34 And Joshua gave a name to the altar of the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and of the half tribe of Manasseh; and said, It is a testimony in the midst of them, that the Lord is their God. 
\c 23  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass after many days after the Lord had given Israel rest from all his enemies round about, that Joshua was old and advanced in years. 
\v 2 And Joshua called together all the children of Israel, and their elders, and their chiefs, and their judges, and their officers; and said to them, I am old and advanced in years. 
\v 3 And ye have seen all that the Lord our God has done to all these nations before us; for \add it is\add* the Lord our God who has fought for you. 
\v 4 See, that I have given to you these nations that are left to you by lots to your tribes, all the nations beginning at Jordan; and \add some\add* I have destroyed; and the boundaries shall be at the great sea westward. 
\p
\v 5 And the Lord our God, he shall destroy them before us, until they utterly perish; and he shall send against them the wild beasts, until he shall have utterly destroyed them and their kings from before you; and ye shall inherit their land, as the Lord our God said to you. 
\v 6 Do ye therefore strive diligently to observe and do all things written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not to the right hand or to the left; 
\v 7 that ye go not in among these nations that are left; and the names of their gods shall not be named among you, neither shall ye serve them, neither shall ye bow down to them. 
\v 8 But ye shall cleave to the Lord our God, as ye have done until this day. 
\v 9 And the Lord shall destroy them before you, \add even\add* great and strong nations; and no one has stood before us until this day. 
\v 10 One of you has chased a thousand, for the Lord our God, he fought for you, as he said to you. 
\p
\v 11 And take ye great heed to love the Lord our God. 
\v 12 For if ye shall turn aside and attach yourselves to these nations that are left with you, and make marriages with them, and become mingled with them and they with you, 
\v 13 know that the Lord will no more destroy these nations from before you; and they will be to you snares and stumbling blocks, and nails in your heels, and darts in your eyes, until ye be destroyed from off this good land, which the Lord your God has given you. 
\p
\v 14 But I hasten to go the way \add of death\add*, as all that are upon the earth also \add do\add*: and know ye in your heart and in your soul, that not one word has fallen \add to the ground\add* of all the words which the Lord our God has spoken respecting all that concerns us; there has not one of them failed. 
\v 15 And it shall come to pass, that as all the good things are come upon us which the Lord spoke concerning you, so the Lord God will bring upon you all the evil things, until he shall have destroyed you from off this good land, which the Lord has given you, 
\v 16 when ye transgress the covenant of the Lord our God, which he has charged us, and go and serve other gods, and bow down to them. 
\c 24  
\p
\v 1 And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shiloh, and convoked their elders, and their officers, and their judges, and set them before God. 
\p
\v 2 And Joshua said to all the people, Thus says the Lord God of Israel, Your fathers at first sojourned beyond the river, \add even\add* Terah, the father of Abraham and the father of Nahor; and they served other gods. 
\v 3 And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the river, and I guided him through all the land, and I multiplied his seed; 
\v 4 and I gave to him Isaac, and to Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave to Esau Mount Seir for him to inherit: and Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt, and became there a great and populous and mighty nation: and the Egyptians afflicted them. 
\v 5 And I smote Egypt with the wonders that I wrought among them. 
\v 6 And afterward \add God\add* brought out our fathers from Egypt, and ye entered into the Red Sea; and the Egyptians pursued after our fathers with chariots and horses into the Red Sea. 
\v 7 And we cried aloud to the Lord; and he put a cloud and darkness between us and the Egyptians, and he brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen all that the Lord did in the land of Egypt; and ye were in the wilderness many days. 
\p
\v 8 And he brought us into the land of the Amorites that dwelt beyond Jordan, and the Lord delivered them into our hands; and ye inherited their land, and utterly destroyed them from before you. 
\p
\v 9 And Balak, king of Moab, son of Zippor, rose up, and made war against Israel, and sent and called Balaam to curse us. 
\v 10 But the Lord thy God would not destroy thee; and he greatly blessed us, and rescued us out of their hands, and delivered them \add to us\add*. 
\v 11 And ye crossed over Jordan, and came to Jericho; and the inhabitants of Jericho fought against us, the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, and the Hittite, and the Girgashite, and the Lord delivered them into our hands. 
\v 12 And he sent forth the hornet before you; and he drove them out from before you, \add even\add* twelve kings of the Amorites, not with thy sword, nor with thy bow. 
\p
\v 13 And he gave you a land on which ye did not labor, and cities which ye did not build, and ye were settled in them; and ye eat \add of\add* vineyards and olive yards which ye did not plant. 
\p
\v 14 And now fear the Lord, and serve him in righteousness and justice; and remove the strange gods, which our fathers served beyond the river, and in Egypt; and serve the Lord. 
\v 15 But if it seem not good to you to serve the Lord, choose to yourselves this day whom ye will serve, whether the gods of your fathers that were on the other side of the river, or the gods of the Amorites, among whom ye dwell upon their land: but I and my house will serve the Lord, for he is holy. 
\p
\v 16 And the people answered and said, Far be it from us to forsake the Lord, so as to serve other gods. 
\v 17 The Lord our God, he is God; he brought up us and our fathers from Egypt, and kept us in all the way wherein we walked, and among all the nations through whom we passed. 
\v 18 And the Lord cast out the Amorite, and all the nations that inhabited the land from before us: yea, we will serve the Lord, for he is our God. 
\p
\v 19 And Joshua said to the people, Indeed ye will not be able to serve the Lord, for God is holy; and he being jealous will not forgive your sins and your transgressions. 
\v 20 Whensoever ye shall forsake the Lord and serve other gods, then he shall come upon you and afflict you, and consume you, because he has done you good. 
\v 21 And the people said to Joshua, Nay, but we will serve the Lord. 
\p
\v 22 And Joshua said to the people, Ye \add are\add* witnesses against yourselves, that ye have chosen the Lord to serve him. 
\v 23 And now take away the strange gods that are among you, and set your heart right toward the Lord God of Israel. 
\v 24 And the people said to Joshua, We will serve the Lord, and we will hearken to his voice. 
\p
\v 25 So Joshua made a covenant with the people on that day, and gave them a law and an ordinance in Shiloh before the tabernacle of the God of Israel. 
\v 26 And he wrote these words in the book of the laws of God: and Joshua took a great stone, and set it up under the oak before the Lord. 
\v 27 And Joshua said to the people, Behold, this stone shall be among you for a witness, for it has heard all the words that have been spoken to it by the Lord; for he has spoken to you this day; and this \add stone\add* shall be among you for a witness in the last days, whenever ye shall deal falsely with the Lord my God. 
\v 28 And Joshua dismissed the people, and they went every man to his place. 
\v 29 And Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that lived as long as Joshua, and all that knew all the works of the Lord which he wrought for Israel. 
\p
\v 30 And it came to pass after these things that Joshua the son of Nun the servant of the Lord died, \add at the age\add* of a hundred and ten years. 
\v 31 And they buried him by the borders of his inheritance in Timnath-serah in the mount of Ephraim, northward of the mount of Gilead: 
\v 31a there they put with him into the tomb in which they buried him, the knives of stone with which he circumcised the children of Israel in Gilgal, when he brought them out of Egypt, as the Lord appointed them; and there they are to this day. 
\p
\v 32 And the children of Israel brought up the bones of Joseph out of Egypt, and buried \add them\add* in Shechem, in the portion of the land which Jacob bought of the Amorites who dwelt in Shechem for a hundred ewe lambs; and he gave it to Joseph for a portion. 
\p
\v 33 And it came to pass afterward that Eleazar the high priest the son of Aaron died, and was buried in Gibeah of Phinehas his son, which he gave him in Mount Ephraim. 
\p
\v 33a In that day the children of Israel took the ark of God, and carried it about among them; and Phinehas exercised the priest’s office in the room of Eleazar his father till he died, and he was buried in his own place Gibeah: 
\v 33b but the children of Israel departed every one to their place, and to their own city: and the children of Israel worshiped Astarte, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of the nations round about them; and the Lord delivered them into the hands of Eglon king of Moab and he ruled over them eighteen years.
