\v 1 The words of Neemias the son of Chelcia. And it came to pass in the month Chaseleu, of the twentieth year, that I was in Susan the palace. 
\v 2 And Anani, one of my brethren, came, he and \add some\add* men of Juda; and I asked them concerning those that had escaped, who had been left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem. 
\v 3 And they said to me, The remnant, \add even\add* those that are left of the captivity, \add are\add* there in the land, in great distress and reproach: and the walls of Jerusalem \add are\add* thrown down, and its gates are burnt with fire. 
\v 4 And it came to pass, when I heard these words, \add that\add* I sat down and wept, and mourned for \add several\add* days, and continued fasting and praying before the God of heaven. 
\v 5 And I said, Nay, I pray you, O Lord God of heaven, the mighty, the great and terrible, keeping your covenant and mercy to them that love him, and to those that keep his commandments: 
\v 6 let now your ear be attentive, and your eyes open, that you may hear the prayer of your servant, which I pray before you at this time, this day \add both\add* day and night, for the children of Israel your servants, and make confession for the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against you: both I and the house of my father have sinned. 
\v 7 We have altogether broken \add covenant\add* with you, and we have not kept the commandments, and the ordinances, and the judgements, which you did command your servant Moses. 
\v 8 Remember, I pray you, the word wherewith you did charge your servant Moses, saying, If you⌃ break covenant \add with me\add*, I will disperse you amongst the nations. 
\v 9 But if you⌃ turn again to me, and keep my commandments, and do them; if you⌃ should be scattered under the utmost \add bound\add* of heaven, thence will I gather them, and I will bring them into the place which I have chosen to cause my name to dwell there. 
\v 10 Now they \add are\add* your servants and your people, whom you have redeemed with your great power, and with your strong hand. 
\v 11  \add Turn\add* not \add away\add*, I pray you, O Lord, but let your ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant, and to the prayer of your servants, who desire to fear your name: and prosper, I pray you, your servant this day, and cause him to find mercy in the sight of this man. Now I was the king's cupbearer. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass in the month Nisan of the twentieth year of king Arthasastha, that the wine was before me: and I took the wine, and gave \add it\add* to the king: and there was not another before him. 
\v 2 And the king said to me, Why is your countenance sad, and do you not control yourself? and now this is nothing but sorrow of heart. Then I was very much alarmed, 
\v 3 and I said to the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be said, forasmuch as the city, even the home of the sepulchres of my fathers, has been laid waste, and her gates have been devoured with fire? 
\v 4 And the king said to me, For what do you ask thus? So I prayed to the God of heaven. 
\v 5 And I said to the king, If \add it seem\add* good to the king, and if your servant shall have found favour in your sight, \add I ask\add* that \add you\add* would send him into Juda, to the city of the sepulchres of my fathers; then will I rebuild it. 
\v 6 And the king, and his concubine that sat next to him, said to me, For how long will your journey be, and when will you return? and \add the proposal\add* was pleasing before the king, and he sent me away, and I appointed him a time. 
\v 7 And I said to the king, If \add it seem\add* good to the king, let him give me letters to the governors beyond the river, so as to forward me till I come to Juda; 
\v 8 and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the garden which belongs to the king, that he may give me timber to cover the gates, and for the wall of the city, and for the house into which I shall enter. And the king gave to me, according as the good hand of God \add was upon me\add*. 
\v 9 And I came to the governors beyond the river, and I gave them the king's letters. (Now the king had sent with me captains of the army and horsemen.) 
\v 10 And Sanaballat the Aronite heard \add it\add*, and Tobia the servant, the Ammonite, and it was grievous to them that a man was come to seek good for the children of Israel. 
\v 11 So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days. 
\v 12 And I rose up by night, I and a few men with me; and I told no man what God put into my heart to do with Israel; and there was no beast with me, except the beast which I rode upon. 
\v 13 And I went forth by the gate of the valley by night, and to the mouth of the well of fig trees, and to the dung-gate: and I mourned over the wall of Jerusalem which they were destroying, and her gates were devoured with fire. 
\v 14 And I passed on to the fountain gate, and to the king's pool; and there was no room for the beast to pass under me. 
\v 15 And I went up by the wall of the brook by night, and mourned over the wall, and passed through the gate of the valley, and returned. 
\v 16 And the sentinels knew not why I went, nor what I was doing; and until that time I told \add it\add* not to the Jews, or to the priests, or to the nobles, or to the captains, or to the rest \add of the men\add* who wrought the works. 
\v 17 Then I said to them, You⌃ see this evil, in which we are, how Jerusalem is desolate, and her gates have been set on fire: come, and let us build throughout the wall of Jerusalem, and we shall be no longer a reproach. 
\v 18 And I told them of the hand of God which was good upon me, also about the words of the king which he spoke to me: and I said, Let us arise and build. And their hands were strengthened for the good \add work\add*. 
\v 19 And Sanaballat the Aronite, and Tobia the servant, the Ammonite, and Gesam the Arabian, heard \add it\add*, and they laughed us to scorn, and came to us, and said, What \add is\add* this thing that you⌃ are doing? are you⌃ revolting against the king? 
\v 20 And I answered them, and said to them, The God of heaven, he shall prosper us, and we his servants are pure, and we will build: but you⌃ have no part, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.

\v 1 Then Eliasub the high priest, and his brethren the priests, rose up, and built the sheep-gate; they sanctified it, and set up the doors of it; even to the tower of the hundred they sanctified \add it\add*, to the tower of Anameel. 
\v 2 And \add they builded\add* by the side of the men of Jericho, and by the side of the sons of Zacchur, the son of Amari. 
\v 3 And the sons of Asana built the fish-gate; they roofed it, and covered in its doors, and bolts, and bars. 
\v 4 And next to them \add the order\add* reached to Ramoth the son of Uria, the son of Accos, and next to them Mosollam son of Barachias the son of Mazebel took \add his\add* place: and next to them Sadoc the son of Baana took \add his\add* place. 
\v 5 And next to them the Thecoim took \add their\add* place; but the Adorim applied not their neck to their service. 
\v 6 And Joida the son of Phasec, and Mesulam son of Basodia, repaired the old gate; they covered it in, and set up its doors, and its bolts, and its bars. 
\v 7 And next to them repaired Maltias the Gabaonite, and Evaron the Meronothite, the men of Gabaon and Maspha, to the throne of the governor on this side the river. 
\v 8 And next to him Oziel the son of Arachias of the smiths, carried on the repairs: and next to them Ananias the son of one of the apothecaries repaired, and they finished Jerusalem to the broad wall. 
\v 9 And next to them repaired Raphaea the son of Sur, the ruler of half the district round about Jerusalem. 
\v 10 And next to them repaired Jedaia the son of Eromaph, and \add that\add* in front of his house: and next to him repaired Attuth son of Asabania. 
\v 11 And next \add to him\add* repaired Melchias son of Heram, and Asub son of Phaat Moab, even to the tower of the furnaces. 
\v 12 And next to him repaired Sallum the son of Alloes, the ruler of half the district round about Jerusalem, he and his daughters. 
\v 13 Anun and the inhabitants of Zano repaired the gate of the valley: they built it, and set up its doors, and its bolts, and its bars, and a thousand cubits of the wall as far as the dung-gate. 
\v 14 And Melchia the son of Rechab, the ruler of the district round about Beth-accharim, repaired the dung-gate, he and his sons; and they covered it, and set up its doors, and its bolts, and its bars. 
\v 15 But Solomon the son of Choleze repaired the gate of the fountain, the ruler of part of Maspha; he built it, and covered it, and set up its doors and its bars, and the wall of the pool of the skins by the meadow of the king, and as far as the steps that lead down from the city of David. 
\v 16 After him repaired Neemias son of Azabuch, ruler of half the district round about Bethsur, as far as the garden of David's sepulchre, and as far as the artificial pool, and as far as the house of the mighty men. 
\v 17 After him repaired the Levites, \add even\add* Raum the son of Bani: next to him repaired Asabia, ruler of half the district round about Keila, in his district. 
\v 18 And after him repaired his brethren, Benei son of Enadad, ruler of half the district round about Keila. 
\v 19 And next to him repaired Azur the son of Joshua, ruler of Masphai, another portion of the tower of ascent, where it meets the corner. 
\v 20 After him repaired Baruch the son of Zabu, a second portion, from the corner as far as the door of the house of Eliasub the high priest. 
\v 21 After him repaired Meramoth the son of Uria the son of Accos, a second part from the door of the house of Eliasub, to the end of the house of Eliasub. 
\v 22 And after him repaired the priests, the men of Ecchechar. 
\v 23 And after him repaired Benjamin and Asub over against their house: and after him repaired Azarias son of Maasias the son of Ananias, \add the parts\add* near to his house. 
\v 24 After him repaired Bani the son of Adad, another portion from the house of Azaria as far as the corner and to the turning, 
\v 25 of Phalach the son of Uzai, opposite the corner, and \add where is\add* also the tower that projects from the king's house, even the upper one of the prison-house: and after him \add repaired\add* Phadaea the son of Phoros. 
\v 26 And the Nathinim lived in Ophal, as far as the garden of the water-gate eastward, and \add there is\add* the projecting tower. 
\v 27 And after them the Thecoim repaired, another portion opposite the great projecting tower, even as far as the wall of Ophla.

\v 31 After him repaired Melchia the son of Sarephi as far as the house of the Nathinim, and the chapmen over against the gate of Maphecad, and as far as the steps of the corner. 
\v 32 And between \add that and\add* the sheep-gate the smiths and chapmen repaired. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 Now it came to pass, when Sanaballat heard that we were building the wall, that it was grievous to him, and he was very angry, and railed against the Jews. 
\v 2 And he said before his brethren (that \add is\add* the army of the Samaritans) \add Is it true\add* that these Jews are building their city? do they indeed offer sacrifices? will they prevail? and will they this day restore the stones, after they have been burnt and made a heap of rubbish? 
\v 3 And Tobias the Ammanite came near to him, and said to them, Do they sacrifice or eat in their place? shall not a fox go up and pull down their wall of stones? 
\v 4 Hear, O our God, for we have become a scorn; and return you their reproach upon their head, and make them a scorn in a land of captivity, 
\v 5-6 and do not cover \add their\add* iniquity. 
\v 7 But it came to pass, when Sanaballat and Tobia, and the Arabians, and the Ammanites, heard that the building of the walls of Jerusalem was advancing, \add and\add* that the breaches began to be stopped, that it appeared very grievous to them. 
\v 8 And all of them assembled together, to come to fight against Jerusalem, and to destroy it utterly. 
\v 9 So we prayed to our God and set watchmen against them day and night, because of them. 
\v 10 And Juda said, The strength of the enemies is broken, yet \add there is\add* much rubbish, and we shall not be able to build the wall. 
\v 11 And they that afflicted us said, They shall not know, and they shall not see, until we come into the midst of them, and kill them, and cause the work to cease. 
\v 12 And it came to pass, when the Jews who lived near them came, that they said to us, They are coming up against us from every quarter. 
\v 13 So I set \add men\add* in the lowest part of the place behind the wall in the lurking-places, I even set the people according to their families, with their swords, their spears, and their bows. 
\v 14 And I looked, and arose, and said to the nobles, and to the captains, and to the rest of the people, Be not afraid of them: remember our great and terrible God, and fight for your brethren, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your houses. 
\v 15 And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was made known to us, and God had frustrated their counsel, that we all returned to the wall, \add every\add* man to his work. 
\v 16 And it came to pass from that day \add that\add* half of them that had been driven forth, wrought the work, and half of them kept guard; and \add there were\add* spears, and shields, and bows, and breastplates, and rulers behind the whole house of Juda, 
\v 17 even of them that were building the wall:—and those who carried the burdens \add were\add* under arms: \add each\add* with one hand wrought his work, and with the other held his dart. 
\v 18 And the builders \add wrought\add* each man having his sword girded upon his loins, and so they built: and the trumpeter with his trumpet next to him. 
\v 19 And I said to the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work \add is\add* great and abundant, and we are dispersed upon the wall, each at a great distance from his brother. 
\v 20 In whatever place you⌃ shall hear the sound of the cornet, there gather yourselves together to us; and our God shall fight for us. 
\v 21 So we \add continued\add* labouring at the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning until the stars appeared. 
\v 22 And at that time I said to the people, Lodge you⌃ every man with his servant in the midst of Jerusalem, and let the night be a watch-time to you, and the day a work-time. 
\v 23 And I was \add there\add*, and the watchmen behind me, and there was not a man of us that put off his garments. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 And the cry of the people and their wives \add was\add* great against their brethren the Jews. 
\v 2 And some said, We \add are\add* numerous with our sons and our daughters; so we will take corn, and eat, and live. 
\v 3 And some said, \add As to\add* our fields and vineyards and houses, let us pledge \add them\add*, and we will take corn, and eat. 
\v 4 And some said, We have borrowed money for the king's tributes:—our fields, and our vineyards, and houses \add are pledged\add*. 
\v 5 And now our flesh \add is\add* as the flesh of our brethren, our children \add are\add* as their children: yet, behold, we are reducing our sons and our daughters to slavery, and some of our daughters are enslaved: and there is no power of our hands, for our fields and our vineyards \add belong\add* to the nobles. 
\v 6 And I was much grieved as I heard their cry and these words. 
\v 7 And my heart took counsel within me, and I contended against the nobles, and the princes, and I said to them, Should every man demand of his brother what you⌃ demand? And I appointed against them a great assembly, 
\v 8 and I said to them, We of our free-will have redeemed our brethren the Jews that were sold to the Gentiles; and do you⌃ sell your brethren? and shall they be delivered to us? And they were silent, and found no answer. 
\v 9 And I said, The thing which you⌃ do \add is\add* not good; you⌃ will not so walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the Gentiles our enemies. 
\v 10 Both my brethren, and my acquaintances, and I, have lent them money and corn: let us now leave off this exaction. 
\v 11 Restore to them, I pray, as at this day, their fields, and their vineyards, and their olive yards, and their houses, and bring forth to them corn and wine and oil of the money. 
\v 12 And they said, We will restore, and we will not exact of them; we will do thus as you say. Then I called the priests, and bound them by oath to do according to this word. 
\v 13 And I shook out my garment, and said, So may God shake out every man who shall not keep to this word, from his house, and from his labours, he shall be even thus shaken out, as an outcast and empty. And all the congregation said, Amen, and they praised the Lord: and the people did this thing. 
\v 14 From the day that he charged me to be their ruler in the land of Juda, from the twentieth year even to the thirty-second year of Arthasastha, twelve years, I and my brethren ate not \add provision\add* extorted from them. 
\v 15 But as for the former acts of extortion wherein \add those who were\add* before me oppressed them, they even took of them their last money, forty didrachmas for bread and wine; and the \add very\add* outcasts of them exercised authority over the people: but I did not so, because of the fear of God. 
\v 16 Also in the work of the wall I treated them not with rigor, I bought not land: and all that were gathered together \add came\add* there to the work. 
\v 17 And the Jews, to \add the number of\add* one hundred and fifty men, besides those coming to us from the nations round about, \add were\add* at my table. 
\v 18 And there came \add to me\add* for one day one calf, and I had six choice sheep and a goat; and every ten days wine in abundance of all sorts: yet with these I required not the bread of extortion, because the bondage was heavy upon this people. 
\v 19 Remember me, O God, for good, \add in\add* all that I have done to this people. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1 Now it came to pass, when Sanaballat, and Tobias, and Gesam the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had built the wall, and \add that\add* there was no opening left therein; (\add but\add* hitherto I had not set up the doors on the gates;) 
\v 2 that Sanaballat and Gesam sent to me, saying, Come and let us meet together in the villages in the plain of Ono. But they \add were\add* plotting to do me mischief. 
\v 3 So I sent messengers to them, saying, I am doing a great work, and I shall not be able to come down, lest the work should cease: as soon as I shall have finished it, I will come down to you. 
\v 4 And they sent to me \add again\add* to this effect; and I sent them \add word\add* accordingly. 
\v 5 Then Sanaballat sent his servant to me with an open letter in his hand. 
\v 6 And in it was written, It has been reported amongst the Gentiles that you and the Jews are planning to revolt: therefore you are building the wall, and you will be a king to them. 
\v 7 And moreover you have appointed prophets to yourself, that you might dwell in Jerusalem as a king over Juda: and now these words will be reported to the king. Now then, come, let us take counsel together. 
\v 8 And I sent to him, saying, It has not happened according to these words, \add even\add* as you say, for you frame them falsely out of your heart. 
\v 9 For all were trying to alarm us, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from this work, and it shall not be done. Now therefore I have strengthened my hands. 
\v 10 And I came into the house of Semei the son of Dalaia the Son of Metabeel, and he was shut up; and he said, Let us assemble together in the house of God, in the midst of it, and let us shut the doors of it; for they are coming by night to kill you. 
\v 11 And I said, Who is the man that shall enter into the house, that he may live? 
\v 12 And I observed, and, behold, God had not sent him, for the prophecy was a fable \add devised\add* against me: 
\v 13 and Tobias and Sanaballat had hired against me a multitude, that I might be frightened, and do this, and sin, and become to them an ill name, that they might reproach me. 
\v 14 Remember, O God, Tobias and Sanaballat, according to these their deeds, and the prophetess Noadia, and the rest of the prophets who tried to alarm me. 
\v 15 So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth day of the \add month\add* Elul, in fifty-two days. 
\v 16 And it came to pass, when all our enemies heard \add of it\add*, that all the nations round about us feared, and great alarm fell upon them, and they knew that it was of our God that this work should be finished. 
\v 17 And in those days letters came to Tobias from many nobles of Juda, and those of Tobias came to them. 
\v 18 For many in Juda were bound to him by oath, because he was son-in-law of Sechenias the son of Herae; and Jonan his son had taken the daughter of Mesulam the son of Barachia to wife. 
\v 19 And they reported his words to me, and carried out my words to him: and Tobias sent letters to terrify me. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed, 
\v 2 that I gave charge to Ananias my brother, and Ananias the ruler of the palace, over Jerusalem: for he was a true man, and one that feared God beyond many. 
\v 3 And I said to them, The gates of Jerusalem shall not be opened till sunrise; and while they are still watching, let the doors be shut, and bolted; and set watches of them that dwell in Jerusalem, \add every\add* man at his post, and \add every\add* man over against his house. 
\v 4 Now the city \add was\add* wide and large; and the people \add were\add* few in it, and the houses were not built. 
\v 5 And God put \add it\add* into my heart, and I gathered the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, into companies: and I found a register of the company that came up first, and I found written in it as follows: 
\v 6 Now these \add are\add* the children of the country, that came up from captivity, of the number which Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon carried away, and they returned to Jerusalem and to Juda, \add every\add* man to his city; 
\v 7 with Zorobabel, and Jesus, and Neemia, Azaria, and Reelma, Naemani, Mardochaeus, Balsan, Maspharath, Esdra, Boguia, Inaum, Baana, Masphar, men of the people of Israel.

\v 37 The children of Lodadid and Ono, seven hundred and twenty-one.

\v 45 The porters; the children of Salum, the children of Ater, the children of Telmon, the children of Acub, the children of Atita, the children of Sabi, one hundred and thirty-eight. 
\v 46 The Nathinim; the children of Sea, the children of Aspha, the children of Tabaoth, 
\v 47 the children of Kiras, the children of Asuia, the children of Phadon, 
\v 48 the children of Labana, the children of Agaba, the children of Selmei,

\v 50 the children of Raaia, the children of Rasson, the children of Necoda, 
\v 51 the children of Gezam, the children of Ozi, the children of Phese, 
\v 52 the children of Besi, the children of Meinon, the children of Nephosasi, 
\v 53 the children of Bacbuc, the children of Achipha, the children of Arur, 
\v 54 the children of Basaloth, the children of Mida, the children of Adasan, 
\v 55 the children of Barcue, the children of Sisarath, the children of Thema, 
\v 56 the children of Nisia, the children of Atipha. 
\v 57 The children of the servants of Solomon; the children of Sutei, the children of Sapharat, the children of Pherida, 
\v 58 the children of Jelel, the children of Dorcon, the children of Gadael, 
\v 59 the children of Saphatia, the children of Ettel, the children of Phacarath, the children of Sabaim, the children of Emim. 
\v 60 All the Nathinim, and children of the servants of Solomon, \add were\add* three hundred and ninety-two. 
\v 61 And these went up from Thelmeleth, Thelaresa, Charub, Eron, Jemer: but they could not declare the houses of their families, or their seed, whether they were of Israel. 
\v 62 The children of Dalaia, the children of Tobia, the children of Necoda, six hundred and forty-two. 
\v 63 And of the priests; the children of Ebia, the children of Acos, the children of Berzelli, for they took wives of the daughters of Berzelli the Galaadite, and they were called by their name. 
\v 64 These sought the pedigree of their company, and it was not found, and they were removed \add as polluted\add* from the priesthood. 
\v 65 And the Athersastha said, that they should not eat of the most holy things, until a priest should stand up to give light. 
\v 66 And all the congregation was about forty-two thousand and three hundred and sixty, 
\v 67-68 besides their menservants and their maidservants: these were seven thousand and three hundred and thirty seven: and the singing-men and singing-women, two hundred and forty-five. 
\v 69 Two thousand and seven hundred asses. 
\v 70 And part of the heads of families gave into the treasury to Neemias for the work a thousand pieces of gold, fifty bowls, and thirty priests' \add garments\add*. 
\v 71 And \add some\add* of the heads of families gave into the treasuries of the work, twenty thousand pieces of gold, and two thousand and three hundred pounds of silver. 
\v 72 And the rest of the people gave twenty thousand pieces of gold, and two thousand and two hundred pounds of silver, and sixty-seven priests' \add garments\add*. 
\v 73 And the priests, and Levites, and porters, and singers, and \add some\add* of the people, and the Nathinim, and all Israel, lived in their cities. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1 And the seventh month arrived, and the children of Israel \add were settled\add* in their cities; and all the people were gathered as one man to the broad place before the water-gate, and they told Esdras the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the Lord commanded Israel. 
\v 2 So Esdras the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women, and every one who had understanding \add was present\add* to listen, on the first day of the seventh month. 
\v 3 And he read in it from the time of sunrise to the middle of the day, before the men and the women; and they understood \add it\add*, and the ears of all the people \add were attentive\add* to the book of the law. 
\v 4 And Esdras the scribe stood on a wooden stage, and there stood next to him Mattathias, and Samaeas, and Ananias, and Urias, and Chelcia, and Massia, on his right hand; and on his left Phadaeas, and Misael, and Melchias, and Asom, and Asabadma, and Zacharias, and Mesollam. 
\v 5 And Esdras opened the book before all the people, for he was above the people; and it came to pass when he had opened it, \add that\add* all the people stood. 
\v 6 And Esdras blessed the Lord, the great God: and all the people answered, and said, Amen, lifting up their hands: and they bowed down and worshipped the Lord with their face to the ground. 
\v 7 And Jesus and Banaias and Sarabias instructed the people in the law, and the people \add stood\add* in their place. 
\v 8 And they read in the book of the law of God, and Esdras taught, and instructed them distinctly in the knowledge of the Lord, and the people understood \add the law\add* in the reading. 
\v 9 And Neemias, and Esdras the priest and scribe, and the Levites, and they that instructed the people, spoke and said to all the people, It is a holy day to the Lord our God; do not mourn, nor weep. For all the people wept when they heard the words of the law. 
\v 10 And \add the governor\add* said to them, Go, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions to them that have nothing; for the day is holy to our Lord: and faint not, for the Lord is our strength. 
\v 11 And the Levites caused all the people to be silent, saying, Be silent, for \add it is\add* a holy day, and despond not. 
\v 12 So all the people departed to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, for they understood the words which he made known to them. 
\v 13 And on the second day the heads of families assembled with all the people, \add also\add* the priests and Levites, to Esdras the scribe, to attend to all the words of the law. 
\v 14 And they found written in the law which the Lord commanded Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths, in the feast in the seventh month: 
\v 15 and that they should sound with trumpets in all their cities, and in Jerusalem. And Esdras said, Go forth to the mountain, and bring branches of olive, and branches of cypress trees, and branches of myrtle, and branches of palm trees, and branches of \add every\add* thick tree, to make booths, according to that which was written. 
\v 16 And the people went forth, and brought \add them\add*, and made booths for themselves, each one upon his roof, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the streets of the city, and as far as the gate of Ephraim. 
\v 17 And all the congregation who had returned from the captivity, made booths, and lived in booths: for the children of Israel \add had\add* not done so from the days of Jesus the son of Naue until that day: and there was great joy. 
\v 18 And \add Esdras\add* read in the book of the law of God daily, from the first day even to the last day: and they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day a solemn assembly, according to the ordinance. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 Now on the twenty-fourth day of this month the children of Israel assembled with fasting, and in sackcloths, and with ashes on their head. 
\v 2 And the children of Israel separated themselves from every stranger, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers. 
\v 3 And they stood in their place, and read in the book of the law of the Lord their god: and they confessed \add their sins\add* to the Lord, and worshipped the Lord their God. 
\v 4  \add And\add* there stood upon the stairs, of the Levites, Jesus, and the sons of Cadmiel, Sechenia the son of Sarabia, sons of Choneni; and they cried with a loud voice to the Lord their God. 
\v 5 And the Levites, Jesus and Cadmiel, said, Rise up, bless the Lord our God forever and ever: and let them bless your glorious name, and exalt it with all blessing and praise. 
\v 6 And Esdras said, You are the only true Lord; you made the heaven, and the heaven of heavens, and all their array, the earth, and all things that are in it, the seas, and all things in them; and you quicken all things, and the hosts of heaven worship you. 
\v 7 You are the Lord God, you did choose Abram, and brought him out of the land of the Chaldeans, and gave him the name of Abraam: 
\v 8 and you found his heart faithful before you, and did make a covenant with him to give to him and to his seed the land of the Chananites, and the Chettites, and Amorites, and Pherezites, and Jebusites, and Gergesites; and you have confirmed your words, for you \add are\add* righteous. 
\v 9 And you saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and you heard their cry at the Red Sea. 
\v 10 And you showed signs and wonders in Egypt, on Pharao and all his servants, and on all the people of his land: for you know that they behaved insolently against them: and you made yourself a name, as at this day. 
\v 11 And you did cleave the sea before them, and they passed through the midst of the sea on dry land; and you did cast into the deep them that were about to pursue them, as a stone in the mighty water. 
\v 12 And you guided them by day by a pillar of cloud, and by night by a pillar of fire, to enlighten for them the way wherein they should walk. 
\v 13 Also you came down upon mount Sina, and you spoke to them out of heaven, and gave them right judgements, and laws of truth, ordinances, and good commandments. 
\v 14 And you did make known to them your holy sabbath; you did enjoin upon them commandments, and ordinances, and a law, by the hand of your servant Moses. 
\v 15 And you gave them bread from heaven for their food, and you brought them forth water from a rock for their thirst; and you bade them go in to inherit the land over which you stretched out your hand to give \add it\add* them. 
\v 16 But they and our fathers behaved proudly, and hardened their neck, and did not listen to your commandments, 
\v 17 and refused to listen, and remembered not your wonders which you wrought with them; and they hardened their neck, and appointed a leader to return to their slavery in Egypt: but you, O God, \add are\add* merciful and compassionate, longsuffering, and abundant in mercy, and you did not forsake them. 
\v 18 And still farther they even made to themselves a molten calf, and said, These \add are\add* the gods that brought us up out of Egypt: and they wrought great provocations. 
\v 19 Yet you in your great compassions did not forsake them in the wilderness: you did not turn away from them the pillar of the cloud by day, to guide them in the way, nor the pillar of fire by night, to enlighten for them the way wherein they should walk. 
\v 20 And you gave your good Spirit to instruct them, and you did not withhold your manna from their mouth, and gave them water in their thirst. 
\v 21 And you did sustain them forty years in the wilderness; you did not allow anything to fail them: their garments did not wax old, and their feet were not bruised. 
\v 22 Moreover, you gave them kingdoms, and did divide nations to them: and they inherited the land of Seon king of Esebon, and the land of Og king of Basan. 
\v 23 And you did multiply their children as the stars of heaven, and brought them into the land of which you spoke to their fathers; 
\v 24 And they inherited it: and you did destroy from before them the dwellers in the land of the Chananites, and you gave into their hands them and their kings, and the nations of the land, to do to them as it pleased them. 
\v 25 And they took lofty cities, and inherited houses full of all good things, wells dug, vineyards, and olive yards, and every fruit tree in abundance: so they ate, and were filled, and grew fat, and rioted in your great goodness. 
\v 26 But they turned, and revolted from you, and cast your law behind their backs; and they killed your prophets, who testified against them to turn them back to you, and they wrought great provocations. 
\v 27 Then you gave them into the hand of them that afflicted them, and they did afflict them: and they cried to you in the time of their affliction, and you did hear them from your heaven, and in your great compassions gave them deliverers, and did save them from the hand of them that afflicted them. 
\v 28 But when they rested, they did evil again before you: so you left them in the hands of their enemies, and they ruled over them: and they cried again to you, and you heard \add them\add* from heaven, and did deliver them in your great compassions. 
\v 29 And you did testify against them, to bring them back to your law: but they listened not, but sinned against your commandments and your judgements, which if a man do, he shall live in them; and they turned their back, and hardened their neck, and heard not. 
\v 30 Yet you did bear long with them many years, and did testify to them by your Spirit by the hand of your prophets: but they listened not; so you gave them into the hand of the nations of the land. 
\v 31 But you in your many mercies did not appoint them to destruction, and did not forsake them; for you are strong, and merciful, and pitiful. 
\v 32 And now, O our God, the powerful, the great, the mighty, and the terrible, keeping your covenant and your mercy, let not all the trouble seem little in your sight which has come upon us, and our kings, and our princes, and our priests, and our prophets, and our fathers, and upon all your people, from the days of the kings of Assur even to this day. 
\v 33 But you \add are\add* righteous in all the things that come upon us; for you have wrought faithfully, but we have greatly sinned. 
\v 34 And our kings, and our princes, and our priests, and our fathers, have not performed your law, and have not given heed to your commandments, and \add have not kept\add* your testimonies which you did testify to them. 
\v 35 And they did not serve you in your kingdom, and in your great goodness which you gave to them, and in the large and fat land which you did furnish before them, and they turned not from their evil devices. 
\v 36 Behold, we are servants this day, and \add as for\add* the land which you gave to our fathers to eat the fruit of it and the good things of it, behold, we are servants upon it: 
\v 37 and its produce \add is\add* abundant for the kings whom you did appoint over us because of our sins; and they have dominion over our bodies, and over our cattle, as it pleases them, and we are in great affliction. 
\v 38 And in regard to all these circumstances we make a covenant, and write \add it\add*, and our princes, our Levites, \add and\add* our priests, set their seal to \add it\add*. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1 And over them that sealed were Neemias the Artasastha, son of Achalia, and Zedekias, 
\v 2 the son of Araea, and Azaria, and Jeremia, 
\v 3 Phasur, Amaria, Melchia, 
\v 4 Attus, Sebani, Maluch, 
\v 5 Iram, Meramoth, Abdia, 
\v 6 Daniel, Gannathon, Baruch, 
\v 7 Mesulam, Abia, Miamin, 
\v 8 Maazia, Belgai, Samaia; these \add were\add* priests. 
\v 9 And the Levites; Jesus the son of Azania, Banaiu of the sons of Enadad, Cadmiel 
\v 10 and his brethren, Sabania, Oduia, Calitan, Phelia, Anan, 
\v 11 Micha, Roob, Asebias, 
\v 12 Zacchor, Sarabia, Sebania, 
\v 13 Odum, the sons of Banuae. 
\v 14 The heads of the people; Phoros, Phaath Moab, Elam, Zathuia, 
\v 15 the sons of Bani, Asgad, Bebai,

\v 25 Reum, Essabana, Maasia, 
\v 26 and Aia, Aenan, Enam, 
\v 27 Maluch, Eram, Baana. 
\v 28 And the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the porters, the singers, the Nathinim, and every one who drew off from the nations of the land to the law of God, their wives, their sons, their daughters, every one who had knowledge and understanding, 
\v 29 were urgent with their brethren, and bound them under a curse, and entered into a curse, and into an oath, to walk in the law of God, which was given by the hand of Moses, the servant of God; to keep and to do all the commandments of the Lord, and his judgements, and his ordinances; 
\v 30 and that we will not, \add they said, \add*give our daughters to the people of the land, nor will we take their daughters to our sons. 
\v 31 And \add as for\add* the people of the land who bring wares and all \add manner of\add* merchandise to sell on the sabbath-day, we \add will\add* not buy of them on the sabbath or on the holy day: and we will leave the seventh year, and the exaction of every debt. 
\v 32 And we will impose ordinances upon ourselves, to levy on ourselves the third part of a didrachm yearly for the service of the house of our God; 
\v 33 the show bread, and the continual meat-offering, and for the continual whole burnt offering, of the sabbaths, of the new moon, for the feast, and for the holy things, and the sin-offerings, to make atonement for Israel, and for the works of the house of our God. 
\v 34 And we cast lots for the office of wood-bearing, \add we\add* the priests, and the Levites, and the people, to bring \add wood\add* into the house of our God, according to the house of our families, at certain set times, year by year, to burn on the altar of the Lord our God, as it is written in the law: 
\v 35 and to bring the first fruits of our land, and the first fruits of the fruit of every tree, year by year, into the house of the Lord: 
\v 36 the firstborn of our sons, and of our cattle, as it is written in the law, and the firstborn of our herds and of our flocks, to bring to the house of our God, for the priests that minister in the house of our God. 
\v 37 And the first fruits of our corn, and the fruit of every tree, of wine, and of oil, will we bring to the priests to the treasury of the house of God; and a tithe of our land to the Levites: for the Levites themselves shall receive tithes in all the cities of the land we cultivate. 
\v 38 And the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites in the tithe of the Levite: and the Levites shall bring up the tenth part of \add their\add* tithe to the house of our God, into the treasuries of the house of God. 
\v 39 For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring into the treasuries the first fruits of the corn, and wine, and oil; and there \add are\add* the holy vessels, and the priests, and the ministers, and the porters, and the singers: and we will not forsake the house of our God. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 And the chiefs of the people lived in Jerusalem: and the rest of the people cast lots, to bring one of \add every\add* ten to dwell in Jerusalem the holy city, and nine parts in the \add other\add* cities. 
\v 2 And the people blessed all the men that volunteered to dwell in Jerusalem. 
\v 3 Now these \add are\add* the chiefs of the province who lived in Jerusalem, and in the cities of Juda; \add every\add* man lived in his possession in their cities: Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the Nathinim, and the children of the servants of Solomon. 
\v 4 And there lived in Jerusalem \add some\add* of the children of Juda, and of the children of Benjamin. Of the children of Juda; Athaia son of Azia, the son of Zacharia, the son of Samaria, the son of Saphatia, the son of Maleleel, and \add some\add* of the sons of Phares; 
\v 5 and Maasia son of Baruch, son of Chalaza, son of Ozia, son of Adaia, son of Joarib, son of Zacharias, son of Seloni. 
\v 6 All the sons of Phares who lived in Jerusalem \add were\add* four hundred and sixty-eight men of might. 
\v 7 And these \add were\add* the children of Benjamin; Selo son of Mesulam, son of Joad, son of Phadaia, son of Coleia, son of Maasias, son of Ethiel, son of Jesia. 
\v 8 And after him Gebe, Seli, nine hundred and twenty-eight. 
\v 9 And Joel son of Zechri \add was\add* overseer over them: and Juda son of Asana was second in the city. 
\v 10 Of the priests: both Jadia son of Joarib, and Jachin. 
\v 11 Saraia, son of Elchia, son of Mesulam, son of Sadduc, son of Marioth, son of Aetoth, was over the house of God. 
\v 12 And their brethren doing the work of the house were eight hundred and twenty-two: and Adaia son of Jeroam, son of Phalalia, son of Amasi, son of Zacharia, son of Phassur, son of Melchia, 
\v 13 and his brethren, chiefs of families, two hundred and forty-two: and Amasia son of Esdriel, son of Mesarimith, son of Emmer, 
\v 14 and his brethren, mighty men of war, one hundred and twenty-eight: and \add their\add* overseer \add was\add* Badiel son of \add one of the\add* great men. 
\v 15-16 And of the Levites; Samaia, son of Esricam, 
\v 17 Matthanias son of Micha, and Jobeb son of Samui, 
\v 18 two hundred and eighty-four. 
\v 19-21 And the porters; Acub, Telamin, and their brethren, one hundred and seventy-two. 
\v 22 And the overseer of the Levites \add was\add* the son of Bani, son of Ozi, son of Asabia, the son of Micha. Of the sons of Asaph the singers \add some were\add* over the house of God, 
\v 23 For so was the king's commandment concerning them. 
\v 24 And Phathaia son of Baseza was in attendance on the king in every matter for the people, 
\v 25 and with regard to villages in their country district: and \add some\add* of the children of Juda lived in Cariatharboc, 
\v 26 and in Jesu, 
\v 27-29 and in Bersabee: 
\v 30 And their villages \add were\add* Lachis and her hands: and they pitched their tents in Bersabee. 
\v 31-35 And the children of Benjamin \add lived\add* from Gabaa \add to\add* Machmas. 
\v 36 And of the Levites there were divisions to Juda \add and\add* to Benjamin. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 Now these \add are\add* the priests and the Levites that went up with Zorobabel the son of Salathiel and Jesus: Saraia, Jeremia, Esdra, 
\v 2 Amaria, Maluch, 
\v 3-6 Sechenia. 
\v 7 These \add were\add* the chiefs of the priests, and their brethren in the days of Jesus. 
\v 8 And the Levites \add were\add*, Jesus, Banui, Cadmiel, Sarabia, Jodae, Matthania: he \add was\add* over the bands, 
\v 9 and his brethren \add were appointed\add* to the daily courses. 
\v 10 And Jesus begot Joakim, and Joakim begot Eliasib, and Eliasib \add begot\add* Jodae, 
\v 11 and Jodae begot Jonathan, and Jonathan begot Jadu. 
\v 12 And in the days of Joakim, his brethren the priests and the heads of families \add were, belonging\add* to Saraia, Amaria; to Jeremia, Anania; 
\v 13 to Esdra, Mesulam; to Amaria, Joanan; 
\v 14 to Amaluch, Jonathan; to Sechenia, Joseph; 
\v 15 to Are, Mannas; to Marioth, Elcai; 
\v 16 to Adadai, Zacharia; to Ganathoth, Mesolam; 
\v 17 to Abia, Zechri; to Miamin, Maadai; to Pheleti, \add one\add*; 
\v 18 to Balgas, Samue; to Semia, Jonathan; 
\v 19 to Joarib, Matthanai; to Edio, Ozi; 
\v 20 to Salai, Callai; to Amec, Abed; 
\v 21 to Elkia, Asabias; to Jedeiu, Nathanael. 
\v 22 The Levites in the days of Eliasib, Joada, and Joa, and Joanan, and Idua, \add were\add* recorded heads of families: also the priests, in the reign of Darius the Persian. 
\v 23 And the sons of Levi, heads of families, \add were\add* written in the book of the chronicles, even to the days of Joanan son of Elisue. 
\v 24 And the heads of the Levites \add were\add* Asabia, and Sarabia, and Jesu: and the sons of Cadmiel, and their brethren over against them, were to sing hymns of praise, according to the commandment of David the man of God, course by course. 
\v 25 When I gathered the porters, 
\v 26  \add it was\add* in the days of Joakim son of Jesus, son of Josedec, and in the days of Neemia: and Esdras the priest \add was\add* scribe. 
\v 27 And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites in their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep a feast of dedication and gladness with thanksgiving, and they sounded cymbals with songs, and \add had\add* lutes and harps. 
\v 28 And the sons of the singers were assembled both from the neighbourhood round about to Jerusalem, and from the villages, 
\v 29 and from the country: for the singers built themselves villages by Jerusalem. 
\v 30 And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and they purified the people, and the porters, and the wall. 
\v 31 And they brought up the princes of Juda on the wall, and they appointed two great \add companies\add* for thanksgiving, and they passed on the right hand on the wall of the dung-gate. 
\v 32 And after them went Osaia, and half the princes of Juda, 
\v 33 and Azarias, and Esdras, and Mesollam, 
\v 34 and Juda, and Benjamin, and Samaias and Jeremia. 
\v 35 And \add some\add* of the sons of the priest with trumpets, Zacharias son of Jonathan, son of Samaias, son of Matthania, son of Michaia, son of Zacchur, son of Asaph: 
\v 36 and his brethren, Samaia, and Oziel, Gelol, Jama, Aia, Nathanael, and Juda, Anani, to praise with the hymns of David the man of God; and Esdras the scribe \add was\add* before them, 
\v 37-38 at the gate, to praise before them, and they went up by the steps of the city of David, in the ascent of the wall, above the house of David, even to the water-gate 
\v 39-41 of Ephraim, and to the fish-gate, and by the tower of Anameel, and as far as the sheep-gate. 
\v 42 And the singers were heard, and were numbered. 
\v 43 And in that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced; for God had made them very joyful: and their wives and their children rejoiced: and the joy in Jerusalem was heard from afar off. 
\v 44 And in that day they appointed men over the treasuries, for the treasures, the first fruits, and the tithes, and \add for\add* the chiefs of the cities who were assembled amongst them, \add to furnish\add* portions for the priests and Levites: for \add there was\add* joy in Juda over the priests and over the Levites that waited. 
\v 45 And they kept the charges of their God, and the charges of the purification, and \add ordered\add* the singers and the porters, according to the commandments of David and his son Solomon. 
\v 46 For in the days of David Asaph was originally first of the singers, and \add they sang\add* hymns and praise to God. 
\v 47 And all Israel in the days of Zorobabel, and in the days of Neemias, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, a daily rate: and consecrated them to the Levites: and the Levites consecrated them to the sons of Aaron. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 In that day they read in the book of Moses in the ears of the people; and it was found written in it, that the Ammonites and Moabites should not enter into the congregation of God for ever; 
\v 2 because they met not the children of Israel with bread and water, but hired Balaam against them to curse them: but our God turned the curse into a blessing. 
\v 3 And it came to pass, when they heard the law, that they were separated, \add even\add* every alien in Israel. 
\v 4 And before this time Eliasib the priest lived in the treasury of the house of our God, connected with Tobias; 
\v 5 and he made himself a great treasury, and there they were formerly in the habit of bestowing the offerings, and the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithe of the corn, and the wine, and the oil, the ordered portion of the Levites, and singers, and porters; and the first fruits of the priests. 
\v 6 But in all this \add time\add* I was not in Jerusalem; for in the thirty-second year of Arthasastha king of Babylon I came to the king, and after a certain time I made my request of the king; 
\v 7 and I came to Jerusalem, and I understood the mischief which Eliasib had done in the case of Tobias, in making for him a treasury in the court of the house of God. 
\v 8 And it appeared very evil to me: so I cast forth all the furniture of the house of Tobias from the treasury. 
\v 9 And I gave orders, and they purified the treasuries: and I restored there the vessels of the house of God, \add and\add* the offerings, and the frankincense. 
\v 10 And I understood that the portion of the Levites had not been given: and they had fled every one to his field, the Levites and the singers doing the work. 
\v 11 And I strove with the commanders, and said, Therefore has the house of God been abandoned? and I assembled them, and set them in their place. 
\v 12 And all Juda brought a tithe of the wheat and the wine and the oil into the treasuries, 
\v 13 to the charge of Selemia the priest, and Sadoc the scribe, and Phadaea of the Levites: and next to them \add was\add* Anan the son of Zacchur, son of Matthanias; for they were accounted faithful: \add it was\add* their office to distribute to their brethren. 
\v 14 Remember me, O God, in this, and let not my kindness be forgotten which I have wrought in \add regard to\add* the house of the Lord God. 
\v 15 In those days I saw in Juda \add men\add* treading wine presses on the sabbath, and carrying sheaves, and loading asses with both wine, and grapes, and figs, and every \add kind of\add* burden, and bringing them into Jerusalem on the sabbath-day: 
\v 16 and I testified in the day of their sale. Also their lived in it \add men\add* bringing fish, and selling every \add kind of\add* merchandise to the children of Juda and in Jerusalem on the sabbath. 
\v 17 And I strove with the free children of Juda, and said to them, What \add is\add* this evil thing which you⌃ do, and profane the sabbath-day? 
\v 18 Did not your fathers thus, and our God brought upon them and upon us and upon this city all these evils? and do you⌃ bring additional wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath? 
\v 19 And it came to pass, when the gates were set up in Jerusalem, before the sabbath, that I spoke, and they shut the gates; and I gave orders that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and I set \add some\add* of my servants at the gates, that none should bring \add in\add* burdens on the sabbath-day. 
\v 20 So all \add the merchants\add* lodged, and carried on traffic without Jerusalem once or twice. 
\v 21 Then I testified against them, and said to them, Why do you⌃ lodge in front of the wall? if you⌃ do so again, I will stretch out my hand upon you. From that time they came not on the sabbath. 
\v 22 and I told the Levites who were purifying themselves, and came and kept the gates, that they should sanctify the sabbath-day. Remember me, O God, for these things, and spare me according to the abundance of your mercy. 
\v 23 And in those days I saw the Jews who had married women of Ashdod, of Ammon, \add and\add* of Moab: 
\v 24 and their children spoke half in the language of Ashdod, and did not know how to speak in the Jewish language. 
\v 25 And I strove with them and cursed them; and I struck some of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, \add saying, \add*You⌃ shall not give your daughters to their sons, and you⌃ shall not take of their daughters to your sons. 
\v 26 Did not Solomon king of Israel sin thus? though there was no king like him amongst many nations, and he was beloved of God, and God made him king over all Israel; yet strange women turned him aside. 
\v 27 So we will not listen to you to do all this evil, to break covenant with our God, —to marry strange wives. 
\v 28 and Elisub the high priest, \add one\add* of the sons of Joada, \add being\add* son-in-law of Sanaballat the Uranite, I chased him away from me. 
\v 29 Remember them, O God, for their \add false\add* connection with the priesthood, and \add the breaking\add* the covenant of the priesthood, and \add for defiling\add* the Levites. 
\v 30 So I purged them from all foreign connection, and established courses for the priests and the Levites, \add every\add* man according to his work. 
\v 31 And the offering of the wood-bearers \add was\add* at certain set times, and in the \add times of the\add* first fruits. Remember me, O our God, for good.
