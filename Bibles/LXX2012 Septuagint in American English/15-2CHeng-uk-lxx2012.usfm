\v 1 And Solomon the son of David was established over his kingdom, and the Lord his God was with him, and increased him exceedingly. 
\v 2 And Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the captains of thousands, and to the captains of hundreds, and to the judges, and to all the rulers over Israel, even the heads of the families; 
\v 3 and Solomon and all the congregation went to the high place that was in Gabaon, where was God's tabernacle of witness, which Moses the servant of the Lord made in the wilderness. 
\v 4 But David had brought up the ark of God out of the city of Cariathiarim; for David had prepared a place for it, for he had pitched a tabernacle for it in Jerusalem. 
\v 5 And the brazen altar which Beseleel the son of Urias, the son of Or, had made, was there before the tabernacle of the Lord: and Solomon and the congregation enquired at it. 
\v 6 And Solomon brought \add victims\add* there to the brazen altar that was before the Lord in the tabernacle, and offered upon it a thousand whole burnt offerings. 
\v 7 In that night God appeared to Solomon, and said to him, Ask what I shall give you. 
\v 8 And Solomon said to God, You have dealt very mercifully with my father David, and have made me king in his stead. 
\v 9 And now, O Lord God, let, I pray you, your name be established upon David my father; for you have made me king over a people numerous as the dust of the earth. 
\v 10 Now give me wisdom and understanding, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who shall judge this your great people? 
\v 11 And God said to Solomon, Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked great wealth, nor glory, nor the life of your enemies, and you have not asked long life; but have asked for yourself wisdom and understanding, that you might judge my people, over whom I have made you king: 
\v 12 I give you this wisdom and understanding; and I will give you wealth, and riches, and glory, so that there shall not have been \add any\add* like you amongst the kings before you, neither shall there be such after you. 
\v 13 And Solomon came from the high place that was in Gabaon to Jerusalem, \add from\add* before the tabernacle of witness, and reigned over Israel. 
\v 14 And Solomon collected chariots and horsemen: and he had fourteen hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen: and he set them in the cities of chariots, and the people \add were\add* with the king in Jerusalem. 
\v 15 And the king made silver and gold in Jerusalem \add to be\add* as stones, and cedars in Judea as sycamores in the plain for multitude. 
\v 16 And Solomon imported horses from Egypt, and the charge of the king's merchants for going \add was as follows\add*, and they traded, 
\v 17 and went and brought out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred \add pieces\add* of silver, and a horse for one hundred and fifty \add pieces\add* of silver: and so they brought for all the kings of the Chettites, and for the kings of Syria by their means. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 And Solomon said that he would build a house to the name of the Lord, and a house for his kingdom. 
\v 2 And Solomon gathered seventy thousand men that bore burdens, and eighty thousand hewers of stone in the mountain, and \add there were\add* three thousand and six hundred superintendents over them. 
\v 3 And Solomon sent to Chiram king of Tyre, saying, Whereas you did deal \add favourably\add* with David my father, and did send him cedars to build for himself a house to dwell in, 
\v 4 behold, I also his son am building a house to the name of the Lord my God, to consecrate it to him, to burn incense before him, and \add to offer\add* show bread continually, and to offer up whole burnt offerings continually morning and evening, and on the sabbaths, and at the new moons, and at the feasts of the Lord our God: this \add is\add* a perpetual \add statute\add* for Israel. 
\v 5 And the house which I am building \add is to be\add* great: for the Lord our God \add is\add* great beyond all gods. 
\v 6 And who will be able to build him a house? for the heaven and heaven of heavens do not bear his glory: and who am I, that I should build him a house, save only to burn incense before him? 
\v 7 And now send me a man wise and skilled to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and in scarlet, and in blue, and one that knows how to grave together with the craftsmen who are with me in Juda and in Jerusalem, which materials my father David prepared. 
\v 8 And send me from Libanus cedar wood, and wood of juniper, and pine; for I know that your servants are skilled in cutting timber in Libanus: and, behold, your servants shall go with my servants, 
\v 9 to prepare timber for me in abundance: for the house which I am building \add must be\add* great and glorious. 
\v 10 And, behold, I have given freely to your servants that work and cut the wood, corn for food, \add even\add* twenty thousand measures of wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand measures of wine, and twenty thousand measures of oil. 
\v 11 And Chiram king of Tyre answered in writing, and sent to Solomon, saying, Because the Lord loved his people, he made you king over them. 
\v 12 And Chiram said, Blessed \add be\add* the Lord God of Israel, who made heaven and earth, who has given to king David a wise son, and one endowed with knowledge and understanding, who shall build a house for the Lord, and a house for his kingdom. 
\v 13 And now I have sent you a wise and understanding man \add who belonged\add* to Chiram my father 
\v 14 (his mother \add was\add* of the daughters of Dan, and his father \add was\add* a Tyrian), skilled to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in stones and wood; and to weave with purple, and blue, and fine linen, and scarlet; and to engrave, and to understand every device, whatever you shall give him \add to do\add* with your craftsmen, and the craftsmen of my lord David your father. 
\v 15 And now, the wheat, and the barley, and the oil, and the wine which my lord mentioned, let him send to his servants. 
\v 16 And we will cut timber out of Libanus according to all your need, and we will bring it on rafts to the sea of Joppa, and you shall bring it to Jerusalem. 
\v 17 And Solomon gathered all the foreigners that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering with which David his father numbered them; and there were found one hundred and fifty-three thousand and six hundred. 
\v 18 And he made of them seventy thousand burden-bearers, and eighty thousand hewers of stone, and three thousand and six hundred taskmasters over the people. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 And Solomon began to build the house of the Lord in Jerusalem in the mount of Amoria, where the Lord appeared to his father David, in the place which David had prepared in the threshing floor of Orna the Jebusite. 
\v 2 And he began to build in the second month, in the fourth year of his reign. 
\v 3 And thus Solomon began to build the house of God: the length in cubits—even the first measurement from end to end, was sixty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits. 
\v 4 And the portico in front of the house, its length in front of the breadth of the house \add was\add* twenty cubits, and its height one hundred and twenty cubits: and he gilded it within with pure gold. 
\v 5 And he lined the great house with cedar wood, and gilded it with pure gold, and carved upon it palm-trees and chains. 
\v 6 And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty; and he gilded it with gold of the gold from Pharuim. 
\v 7 And he gilded the house, and its \add inner\add* walls, and the door-posts, and the roofs, and the doors with gold; and he carved cherubs on the walls. 
\v 8 And he built the holy of holies, its length was according to the front \add of the other house\add*, the breadth of the house \add was\add* twenty cubits, and the length twenty cubits: and he gilded \add it\add* with pure gold for cherubs, to \add the amount of\add* six hundred talents. 
\v 9 And the weight of the nails, \add even\add* the weight of each was fifty shekels of gold: and he gilded the upper chamber with gold. 
\v 10 And he made two cherubs in the most holy house, wood-work, and he gilded them with gold. 
\v 11-12 And the wings of the cherubs were twenty cubits in length: and one wing of five cubits touched the wall of the house: and the other wing of five cubits touched the wing of the other cherub. 
\v 13 And the wings of these cherubs expanded were of the length of twenty cubits: and they stood upon their feet, and their faces were towards the house. 
\v 14 And he made the vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and wove cherubs in it. 
\v 15 Also he made in front of the house two pillars, in height thirty-five cubits, and their chapters of five cubits. 
\v 16 And he made chains, \add as\add* in the oracle, and put \add them\add* on the heads of the pillars; and he made one hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains. 
\v 17 And he set up the pillars in front of the temple, one on the right hand and the other on the left: and he called the name of the one on the right hand 'Stability,' and the name of the one on the left 'Strength.' 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 And he made a brazen altar, the length of it twenty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits, and the height ten cubits. 
\v 2 And he made the molten sea, in diameter ten cubits, entirely round, and the height of it five cubits, and the circumference thirty cubits. 
\v 3 And beneath it the likeness of calves, they compass it round about: ten cubits compass the laver round about, they cast the calves two rows in their casting, 
\v 4 wherein they made them twelve calves, —three looking northwards, and three westwards, and three southwards, and three eastwards: and the sea was upon them above, \add and\add* their hinder parts were inward. 
\v 5 And its thickness was a hand-breadth, and its brim as the brim of a cup, graven with flowers of lilies, holding three thousand measures: and he finished \add it\add*. 
\v 6 And he made ten lavers, and set five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them the instruments of the whole burnt offerings, and to rinse \add the vessels\add* in them; and the sea \add was\add* for the priests to wash in. 
\v 7 And he made the ten golden candlesticks according to their pattern, and he put them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left. 
\v 8 And he made ten tables, and put them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left: and he made one hundred golden bowls. 
\v 9 Also he made the priests' court, and the great court, and doors to the court, and their panels \add were\add* overlaid with brass. 
\v 10 And he set the sea at the corner of the house on the right, as it were fronting the east. 
\v 11 And Chiram made the flesh hooks, and the fire-pans, and the grate of the altar, and all its instruments: and Chiram finished doing all the work which he wrought for king Solomon in the house of God: 
\v 12 two pillars, and upon them an embossed work for the capitals on the heads of the two pillars, and two nets to cover the heads of the capitals which are on the heads of the pillars; 
\v 13 and four hundred golden bells for the two nets, and two rows of pomegranates in each net, to cover the two embossed rims of the capitals which are upon the pillars. 
\v 14 And he made the ten bases, and he made the lavers upon the bases; 
\v 15 and the one sea, and the twelve calves under it; 
\v 16 and the foot-baths, and the buckets, and the cauldrons, and the flesh hooks, and all their furniture (which Chiram made, and brought to king Solomon in the house of the Lord) of pure brass. 
\v 17 In the country round about Jordan the king cast them, in the clay ground in the house of Socchoth, and between \add that and\add* Saredatha. 
\v 18 So Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance, for the quantity of brass failed not. 
\v 19 And Solomon made all the vessels of the house of the Lord, and the golden altar, and the tables, and upon them \add were to be\add* the loaves of show bread; 
\v 20 also the candlesticks, and the lamps to give light according to the pattern, and in front of the oracle, of pure gold. 
\v 21 And their snuffers, and their lamps \add were made\add*, and \add he made\add* the bowls, and the censers, and the fire-pans, of pure gold. 
\v 22 And \add there was\add* the inner door of the house \add opening\add* into the holy of holies, and \add he made\add* the inner doors of the temple of gold. So all the work which Solomon wrought for the house of the Lord was finished. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 And Solomon brought in the holy things of his father David, the silver, and the gold, and the \add other\add* vessels, and put them in the treasury of the house of the Lord. 
\v 2 Then Solomon assembled all the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, \add even\add* the leaders of the families of the children of Israel, to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the city of David, —this \add is\add* Sion. 
\v 3 And all Israel were assembled \add to\add* the king in the feast, this \add is\add* the seventh month. 
\v 4 And all the elders of Israel came; and all the Levites took up the ark, 
\v 5 and the tabernacle of witness, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle; and the priests and the Levites brought it up. 
\v 6 And king Solomon, and all the elders of Israel, and the religious of them, and they of them that were gathered before the ark, \add were\add* sacrificing calves and sheep, which could not be numbered or reckoned for multitude. 
\v 7 And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the Lord into its place, into the oracle of the house, \add even\add* into the holy of holies, under the wings of the cherubs. 
\v 8 And the cherubs stretched out their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubs covered the ark, and its staves above. 
\v 9 And the staves projected, and the heads of the staves were seen from the holy place in front of the oracle, they were not seen without: and there they were to this day. 
\v 10 There was nothing in the ark except the two tables which Moses placed \add there\add* in Choreb, which God gave in covenant with the children of Israel, when they went out of the land of Egypt. 
\v 11 And it came to pass, when the priests when out of the holy place, (for all the priests that were found were sanctified, they were not \add then\add* arranged according to their daily course,) 
\v 12 that all the singing Levites \add assigned\add* to the sons of Asaph, to Aeman, to Idithun, and to his sons, and to his brethren, of them that were clothed in linen garments, with cymbals and lutes and harps, \add were\add* standing before the altar, and with them one hundred and twenty priests, blowing trumpets. 
\v 13 And there was one voice in the trumpeting and in the psalm-singing, and in the loud utterance with one voice to give thanks and praise the Lord; and when they raised their voice together with trumpets and cymbals, and instruments of music, and said, Give thanks to the Lord, for \add it is\add* good, for his mercy \add endures\add* for ever:—then the house was filled with the cloud of the glory of the Lord. 
\v 14 And the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the Lord filled the house of God. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1 Then said Solomon, The Lord said that he would dwell in thick darkness. 
\v 2 But I have built a house to your name, holy to you, and prepared \add for you\add* to dwell in for ever. 
\v 3 And the king turned his face, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel stood by. 
\v 4 And he said, Blessed \add be\add* the Lord God of Israel: he has even fulfilled with his hands as he spoke with his mouth to my father David, saying, 
\v 5 From the day when I brought up my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city of all the tribes of Israel, to build a house that my name should be there; neither did I choose a man to be a leader over my people Israel. 
\v 6 But I chose Jerusalem that my name should be there; and I chose David to be over my people Israel. 
\v 7 And it came into the heart of David my father, to build a house for the name of the Lord God of Israel. 
\v 8 But the Lord said to my father David, Whereas it came into your heart to build a house for my name, you did well that it came into your heart. 
\v 9 Nevertheless you shall not build the house; for your son who shall come forth out of your loins, he shall build the house for my name. 
\v 10 And the Lord has confirmed this word, which he spoke; and I am raised up in the room of my father David, and I sit upon the throne of Israel as the Lord said, and I have built the house for the name of the Lord God of Israel: 
\v 11 and I have set there the ark in which \add is\add* the covenant of the Lord, which he made with Israel. 
\v 12 And he stood before the altar of the Lord in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread out his hands. 
\v 13 For Solomon \add had\add* made a brazen scaffold, and set it in the midst of the court of the sanctuary; the length of it \add was\add* five cubits, and the breadth of it five cubits, and the height of it three cubits: and he stood upon it, and fell upon his knees before the whole congregation of Israel, and spread abroad his hands to heaven, 
\v 14 and said, Lord God of Israel, there is no God like you in heaven, or on the earth; keeping covenant and mercy with your servants that walk before you with \add their\add* whole heart. 
\v 15 Even as you have kept \add them\add* with your servant David my father, as you have spoken to him in words:—you have both spoken with your mouth, and have fulfilled \add it\add* with your hands, as it is this day. 
\v 16 and now, Lord God of Israel, keep with your servant David my father the things which you spoke to him, saying, There shall not fail you a man before me sitting on the throne of Israel, if only your sons will take heed to their way to walk in my law, as you did walk before me. 
\v 17 And now, Lord God of Israel, let, I pray you, your word be confirmed, which you have spoken to your servant David. 
\v 18 For will God indeed dwell with men upon the earth? if the heaven and the heaven of heavens will not suffice you, what then is this house which I have built? 
\v 19 Yet you shall have respect to the prayer of your servant, and to my petition, O Lord God, so as to listen to the petition and the prayer which your servant prays before you this day: 
\v 20 so that your eyes should be open over this house by day and by night, towards this place, whereon you said your name should be called, so as to hear the prayer which your servant prays towards this house. 
\v 21 And you shall hear the supplication of your servant, and of your people Israel, whatever prayers they shall make towards this place: and you shall listen in your dwelling-place out of heaven, yes you shall hear, and be merciful. 
\v 22 If a man sin against his neighbour, and he bring an oath upon him so as to make him swear, and he come and swear before the altar in this house; 
\v 23 then shall you listen out of heaven, and do, and judge your servants, to recompense the transgressor, and to return his ways upon his head: and to justify the righteous, to recompense him according to his righteousness. 
\v 24 And if your people Israel should be put to the worse before the enemy, if they should sin against you, and \add then\add* turn and confess to your name, and pray and make supplication before you in this house; 
\v 25 then shall you listen out of heaven and shall be merciful to the sins of your people Israel, and you shall restore them to the land which you gave to them and to their fathers. 
\v 26 When heaven is restrained, and there is no rain, because they shall have sinned against you, and \add when\add* they shall pray towards this place, and praise your name, and shall turn from their sins, because you shall afflict them; 
\v 27 then shall you listen from heaven, and you shall be merciful to the sins of your servants, and of your people Israel; for you shall show them the good way in which they shall walk; and you shall send rain upon your land, which you gave to your people for an inheritance. 
\v 28 If there should be famine upon the land, if there should be death, a pestilent wind an blight; if there should be locust and caterpiller, and if the enemy should harass them before their cities: in whatever plague and whatever distress \add they may be\add*; 
\v 29 Then whatever prayer and whatever supplication shall be made by any man and all your people Israel, if a man should know his own plague and his own sickness, and should spread forth his hands towards this house; 
\v 30 then shall you hear from heaven, out of your prepared dwelling-place, and shall be merciful, and shall recompense to the man according to his ways, as you shall know his heart \add to be\add*; for you alone know the heart of the children of men: 
\v 31 that they may reverence all your ways all the days which they live upon the face of the land, which you gave to our fathers. 
\v 32 And every stranger who is not himself of your people Israel, and who shall have come from a distant land because of your great name, and your mighty hand, and your high arm; when they shall come and worship towards this place; — 
\v 33 then shall you listen out of heaven, out of your prepared dwelling-place, and shall do according to all that the stranger shall call upon you for; that all the nations of the earth may know your name, and that they may fear you, as your people Israel \add do\add*, and that they may know that your name is called upon this house which I have built. 
\v 34 And if your people shall go forth to war against their enemies by the way by which you shall send them, and shall pray to you towards this city which you have chosen, and \add towards\add* the house which I have built to your name; 
\v 35 then shall you hear out of heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause. 
\v 36 Whereas if they shall sin against you, (for there is no man who will not sin,) and you shall strike them, and deliver them up before their enemies, and they that take them captive shall carry them away into a land of enemies, to a land far off or near; 
\v 37 and \add if\add* they shall repent in their land whither they were carried captive, and shall also turn and make supplication to you in their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have transgressed, we have wrought unrighteously; 
\v 38 and \add if\add* they shall turn to you with all their heart and all their soul in the land of them that carried them captives, whither they carried them captives, and shall pray towards their land which you gave to their fathers, and the city which you did choose, and the house which I built to your name:— 
\v 39 then shall you hear out of heaven, out of your prepared dwelling-place, their prayer and their supplication, and you shall execute justice, and shall be merciful to your people that sin against you. 
\v 40 And now, Lord, let, I pray you, your eyes be opened, and your ears be attentive to the petition \add made in\add* this place. 
\v 41 And now, O Lord God, arise into your resting-place, you, and the ark of your strength: let your priests, O Lord God, clothe themselves with salvation, and your sons rejoice in prosperity. 
\v 42 O Lord God, turn not away the face of your anointed: remember the mercies of your servant David. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1 And when Solomon had finished praying, then the fire came down from heaven, and devoured the whole burnt offerings and the sacrifices; and the glory of the Lord filled the house. 
\v 2 And the priests could not enter into the house of the Lord at that time, for the glory of the Lord filled the house. 
\v 3 And all the children of Israel saw the fire descending, and the glory of the Lord was upon the house: and they fell upon their face to the ground on the pavement, and worshipped, and praised the Lord; for \add it is\add* good \add to do so\add*, because his mercy \add endures\add* for ever. 
\v 4 And the king and all the people \add were\add* offering sacrifices before the Lord. 
\v 5 And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of calves twenty and two thousand, of sheep one hundred and twenty thousand: so the king and all the people dedicated the house of God. 
\v 6 And the priests were standing at their watches, and the Levites with instruments of music of the Lord, belonging to king David, to give thanks before the Lord, for his mercy \add endures\add* for ever, with the hymns of David, by their ministry: and the priests were blowing the trumpets before them, and all Israel standing. 
\v 7 And Solomon consecrated the middle of the court that was in the house of the Lord: for he offered there the whole burnt offerings and the fat of the peace-offerings, for the brazen altar which Solomon had made was not sufficient to receive the whole burnt offerings, and the meat-offerings, and the fat. 
\v 8 And Solomon kept the feast at that time seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly, from the entering in of Aemath, and as far as the river of Egypt. 
\v 9 And on the eighth day he kept a solemn assembly: for he kept a feast of seven days as the dedication of the altar. 
\v 10 And on the twenty-third day of the seventh month he dismissed the people to their tents, rejoicing, and with a glad heart because of the good deeds which the Lord had done to David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people. 
\v 11 So Solomon finished the house of the Lord, and the king's house: and in whatever Solomon wished in his heart to do in the house of the Lord and in his own house, he prospered. 
\v 12 And the Lord appeared to Solomon by night, and said to him, I have heard your prayer, and I have chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice. 
\v 13 If I should restrain the heaven and there should be no rain, and if I should command the locust to devour the trees, and if I should send pestilence upon my people; 
\v 14 then if my people, on whom my name is called, should repent, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their evil ways, I also will hear from heaven, and I will be merciful to their sins, and I will heal their land. 
\v 15 And now my eyes shall be open, and my ears attentive to the prayer of this place. 
\v 16 And now I have chosen and sanctified this house, that my name should be there for ever: and my eyes and my heart shall be there always. 
\v 17 And if you will walk before me as David your father \add did\add*, and will do according to all that I have commanded you, and will keep my ordinances and my judgements; 
\v 18 then will I establish the throne of your kingdom, as I covenanted with David your father, saying, There shall not fail you a man ruling in Israel. 
\v 19 But if you⌃ should turn away, and forsake my ordinances and my commandments, which I have set before you, and go and serve other gods, and worship them; 
\v 20 then will I remove you from the land which I gave them; and this house which I have consecrated to my name I will remove out of my sight, and I will make it a proverb and a byword amongst all nations. 
\v 21 And \add as for\add* this lofty house, every one that passes by it shall be amazed, and shall say, Therefore has the Lord done \add thus\add* to this land, and to this house? 
\v 22 And \add men\add* shall say, Because they forsook the Lord God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and they attached themselves to other gods, and worshipped them, and served them: and therefore he has brought upon them all this evil. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass after twenty years, in which Solomon built the house of the Lord, and his own house, 
\v 2 that Solomon rebuilt the cities which Chiram had given to Solomon, and caused the children of Israel to dwell in them. 
\v 3 And Solomon came to Baesoba, and fortified it. 
\v 4 And he built Thoedmor in the wilderness, and all the strong cities which he built in Emath. 
\v 5 And he built Baethoron the upper, and Baethoron the lower, strong cities, —they had walls, gates, and bars; 
\v 6 and Balaath, and all the strong cities which Solomon had, and all his chariot cities, and cities of horsemen, and all things that Solomon desired according to his desire of building, in Jerusalem, and in Libanus, and in all his kingdom. 
\v 7  \add As for\add* all the people that was left of the Chettites, and the Amorites, and the Pherezites, and the Evites, and the Jebusites, who are not of Israel, 
\v 8 but were of the children of them whom the children Israel destroyed not, that were left after them in the land, even them did Solomon make tributaries to this day. 
\v 9 But Solomon did not make any of the children of Israel servants in his kingdom; for, behold, \add they were\add* warriors and rulers, and mighty \add men\add*, and captains of chariots and horsemen. 
\v 10 And these are the chiefs of the officers of king Solomon, two hundred and fifty overseeing the work amongst the people. 
\v 11 And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharao from the city of David to the house which he had built for her: for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the city of David, the king of Israel, for \add the place\add* is holy into which the ark of the Lord has entered. 
\v 12 Then Solomon offered up to the Lord whole burnt offerings on the altar which he had built to the Lord before the temple, 
\v 13 according to the daily rate, to offer up \add sacrifices\add* according to the commandments of Moses, on the sabbaths, and at the new moons, and at the feasts, three times in the year, at the feast of unleavened bread, and at the feast of weeks, and at the feast of tabernacles. 
\v 14 And he established, according to the order of his father David, the courses of the priests, and \add that\add* according to their public ministrations: and the Levites \add were appointed\add* over their charges, to praise and minister before the priests according to the daily order: and the porters were appointed according to their courses to the different gates: for thus \add were\add* the commandments of David the man of God. 
\v 15 They transgressed not the commandments of the king concerning the priests and the Levites with regard to everything else, and with regard to the treasures. 
\v 16 Now all the work had been prepared from the day when the foundation was laid, until Solomon finished the house of the Lord. 
\v 17 Then Solomon went to Gasion Gaber, and to Aelath near the sea in the land of Idumea. 
\v 18 And Chiram sent by the hand of his servants ships, and servants skilled in naval affairs; and they went with the servants of Solomon to Sophira, and brought thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and they came to king Solomon. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 And the queen of Saba heard \add of\add* the name of Solomon, and she came to Jerusalem with a very large force, to prove Solomon with hard questions, and \add she had\add* camels bearing spices in abundance, and gold, and precious stones: and she came to Solomon, and told him all that was in her mind. 
\v 2 And Solomon told her all her words; and there passed not a word from Solomon which he told her not. 
\v 3 And the queen of Saba saw the wisdom of Solomon, and the house which he had built, 
\v 4 and the meat of the tables, and the sitting of his servants, and the standing of his ministers, and their raiment; and his cupbearers, and their apparel; and the whole burnt offerings which he offered up in the house of the Lord; then she was in ecstasy. 
\v 5 And she said to the king, \add It was\add* a true report which I heard in my land concerning your words, and concerning your wisdom. 
\v 6 Yet I believed not the reports until I came, and my eyes saw: and, behold, the half of the abundance of your wisdom was not told me: you have exceeded the report which I heard. 
\v 7 Blessed \add are\add* your men, blessed \add are\add* these your servants, who stand before you continually, and hear your wisdom. 
\v 8 Blessed be the Lord your God, who took pleasure in you, to set you upon his throne for a king, to the Lord your God: forasmuch as the Lord your God loved Israel to establish them for ever, therefore he has set you over them for a king to execute judgement and justice. 
\v 9 And she gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold, and spices in very great abundance, and precious stones: and there were not \add any where else\add* such spices as those which the queen of Saba gave king Solomon. 
\v 10 And the servants of Solomon and the servants of Chiram brought gold to Solomon out of Suphir, and pine timber, and precious stones. 
\v 11 And the king made of the pine timber steps to the house of the Lord, and to the king's house, and harps and lutes for the singers: and such were not seen before in the land of Juda. 
\v 12 And king Solomon gave to the queen of Saba all that she requested, besides all that she brought to king Solomon: and she returned to her \add own\add* land. 
\v 13 And the weight of the gold that was brought to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold, 
\v 14 besides what the men who were regularly appointed and the merchants brought, and all the kings of Arabia and princes of the land: all brought gold and silver to king Solomon. 
\v 15 And king Solomon made two hundred shields of beaten gold: there were six hundred \add shekels\add* of pure gold to one shield. 
\v 16 And three hundred buckles of beaten gold: \add the weight\add* of three hundred gold shekels went to one buckler: and the king placed them in the house of the forest of Lebanon. 
\v 17 And the king made a great throne of ivory, and he gilded it with pure gold. 
\v 18 And \add there were\add* six steps to the throne, riveted with gold, and elbows on either side of the seat of the throne, and two lions standing by the elbows: 
\v 19 and twelve lions standing there on the six steps on each side. There was not the like in any \add other\add* kingdom. 
\v 20 And all king Solomon's vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were covered with gold: silver was not thought anything of in the days of Solomon. 
\v 21 For a ship went for the king to Tharsis with the servants of Chiram: once every three years came vessels from Tharsis to the king, laden with gold, and silver, and ivory, and apes. 
\v 22 And Solomon exceeded all \add other\add* kings both in riches and wisdom. 
\v 23 And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart. 
\v 24 And they brought every one his gifts, silver vessels and golden vessels, and raiment, myrrh and spices, horses and mules, a rate every year. 
\v 25 And Solomon had four thousand mares for chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; and he put them in the chariot cities, and with the king in Jerusalem. 
\v 26 And he rules over all the kings from the river even to the land of the Philistines, and to the borders of Egypt. 
\v 27 And the king made gold and silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars as the sycamore trees in the plain for abundance. 
\v 28 And Solomon imported horses from Egypt, and from every \add other\add* country. 
\v 29 And the rest of the acts of Solomon, the first and the last, behold, these are written in the words of Nathan the prophet, and in the words of Achia the Selonite, and in the visions of Joel the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nabat. 
\v 30 And Solomon reigned over all Israel forty years. 
\v 31 And Solomon fell asleep, and they buried him in the city of David his father: and Roboam his son reigned in his stead. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1 And Roboam came to Sychem: for all Israel came to Sychem to make him king. 
\v 2 And it came to pass when Jeroboam the son of Nabat heard \add it\add*, (now he was in Egypt, forasmuch as he had fled there from the face of king Solomon, and Jeroboam lived in Egypt,) that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt. 
\v 3 And they sent and called him: and Jeroboam and all the congregation came to Roboam, saying, 
\v 4 Your father made our yoke grievous: now then abate \add somewhat\add* of your father's grievous rule, and of his heavy yoke which he put upon us, and we will serve you. 
\v 5 And he said to them, Go away for three days, and \add then\add* come to me. So the people departed. 
\v 6 And king Roboam assembled the elders that stood before his father Solomon in his life-time, saying, How do you⌃ counsel \add me\add* to return an answer to this people? 
\v 7 And they spoke to him, saying, If you would this day befriend this people, and be kind to them, and speak to them good words, then will they be your servants for ever. 
\v 8 But he forsook the advice of the old men, who took counsel with him, and he took counsel with the young men who had been brought up with him, who stood before him. 
\v 9 And he said to them, What do you⌃ advise that I should answer this people, who spoke to me, saying, Ease \add somewhat\add* of the yoke which your father laid upon us? 
\v 10 And the young men that had been brought up with him spoke to him, saying, Thus shall you speak to the people that spoke to you, saying, Your father made our yoke heavy, and do you lighten \add somewhat of it\add* from us; thus shall you say, My little finger \add shall be\add* thicker than my father's loins. 
\v 11 And whereas my father chastised you with a heavy yoke, I will also add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, and I will chastise you with scorpions. 
\v 12 And Jeroboam and all the people came to Roboam on the third day, as the king had spoken, saying, Return to me on the third day. 
\v 13 And the king answered harshly; and king Roboam forsook the counsel of the old men, 
\v 14 and spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions. 
\v 15 And the king listened not to the people, for there was a change \add of their minds\add* from God, saying, The Lord has confirmed his word, which he spoke by the hand of Achia the Selonite concerning Jeroboam the son of Nabat, and \add concerning\add* all Israel; 
\v 16 for the king did not listen to them. And the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David, or inheritance in the son of Jessae? to your tents, O Israel: now see to your own house, David. So all Israel went to their tents. 
\v 17 But the men of Israel, even those who lived in the cities of Juda, \add remained\add* and made Roboam king over them. 
\v 18 And king Roboam sent to them Adoniram that was over the tribute; and the children of Israel stoned him with stones, and he died. And king Roboam hasted to mount \add his\add* chariot, to flee to Jerusalem. 
\v 19 So Israel rebelled against the house of David until this day. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 And Roboam came to Jerusalem; and he assembled Juda and Benjamin, one hundred and eighty thousand young men fit for war, and he waged war with Israel to recover the kingdom to Roboam. 
\v 2 And the Word of the Lord came to Samaias the man of God, saying, 
\v 3 Speak to Roboam the \add son\add* of Solomon, and to all Juda and Benjamin, saying, 
\v 4 Thus says the Lord, You⌃ shall not go up, and you⌃ shall not war against your brethren: return every one to his home; for this thing is of me. And they listened to the word of the Lord, and returned from going against Jeroboam. 
\v 5 And Roboam lived in Jerusalem, and he built walled cities in Judea. 
\v 6 And he built Bethleem, and Aetan and Thecoe, 
\v 7 and Baethsura, and Sochoth, and Odollam, 
\v 8 and Geth, and Marisa, and Ziph, 
\v 9 and Adorai, and Lachis, and Azeca, 
\v 10 and Saraa, and Aelom, and Chebron, which belong to Juda and Benjamin, walled cities. 
\v 11 And he fortified them with walls, and placed in them captains, and stores of provisions, oil and wine, 
\v 12 shields and spears in every several city, and he fortified them very strongly, and he had on his side Juda and Benjamin. 
\v 13 And the priests and the Levites who were in all Israel were gathered to him out of all the coasts. 
\v 14 For the Levites left the tents of their possession, and went to Juda to Jerusalem, because Jeroboam and his sons had ejected them so that they should not minister to the Lord. 
\v 15 And he made for himself priests of the high places, and for the idols, and for the vanities, and for the calves which Jeroboam made. 
\v 16 And he cast out from the tribes of Israel those who set their heart to seek the Lord God of Israel: and they came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice to the Lord God of their fathers. 
\v 17 And they strengthened the kingdom of Juda; and \add Juda\add* strengthened Roboam the \add son\add* of Solomon for three years, for he walked three years in the ways of David and Solomon. 
\v 18 And Roboam took to himself for a wife, Moolath daughter of Jerimuth the son of David, and Abigaia daughter of Heliab the son of Jessae. 
\v 19 And she bore him sons; Jeus, and Samoria, and Zaam. 
\v 20 And afterwards he took to himself Maacha the daughter of Abessalom; and she bore him Abia, and Jetthi, and Zeza, and Salemoth. 
\v 21 And Roboam loved Maacha the daughter of Abessalom more than all his wives and all his concubines: for he had eighteen wives and sixty concubines; and he begot twenty-eight sons, and sixty daughters. 
\v 22 And he made Abia the son of Maacha chief, \add even\add* a leader amongst his brethren, for he intended to make him king. 
\v 23 And he was exalted beyond all his \add other\add* sons in all the coasts of Juda and Benjamin, and in the strong cities; and he gave them provisions in great abundance: and he desired many wives. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass when the kingdom of Roboam was established, and when he had grown strong, \add that\add* he forsook the commandments of the Lord, and all Israel with him. 
\v 2 And it came to pass in the fifth year of the reign of Roboam, Susakim king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had sinned against the Lord, 
\v 3 with twelve hundred chariots, and sixty thousand horses: and there was no number of the multitude that came with him from Egypt; Libyans, Trogodytes, and Ethiopians. 
\v 4 And they obtained possession of the strong cities, which were in Juda, and came to Jerusalem. 
\v 5 And Samaias the prophet came to Roboam, and to the princes of Juda that were gathered to Jerusalem for fear of Susakim, and said to them, Thus said the Lord, You⌃ have left me, and I will leave you in the hand of Susakim. 
\v 6 And the elders of Israel and the king were ashamed, and said, The Lord \add is\add* righteous. 
\v 7 And when the Lord saw that they repented, then came the word of the Lord to Samaias, saying, They have repented; I will not destroy them, but I will set them in safety for a little while, and my wrath shall not be poured out on Jerusalem. 
\v 8 Nevertheless they shall be servants, and know my service, and the service of the kings of the earth. 
\v 9 So Susakim king of Egypt went up against Jerusalem, and took the treasures that were in the house of the Lord, and the treasures that were in the king's house: he took all; and he took the golden shields which Solomon had made. 
\v 10 And king Roboam made brazen shields instead of them. And Susakim set over him captains of footmen, as keepers of the gate of the king. 
\v 11 And it came to pass, when the king went into the house of the Lord, the guards and the footmen went in, and they that returned to meet the footmen. 
\v 12 And when he repented, the anger of the Lord turned from him, and did not destroy him utterly; for there were good things in Juda. 
\v 13 So king Roboam strengthened \add himself\add* in Jerusalem, and reigned: and Roboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, in the city which the Lord chose out of all the tribes of the children of Israel to call his name there: and his mother's name was Noomma the Ammanitess. 
\v 14 And he did evil, for he directed not his heart to seek the Lord. 
\v 15 And the acts of Roboam, the first and the last, behold, are they not written in the book of Samaia the prophet, and Addo the seer, with his achievements. 
\v 16 And Roboam made war with Jeroboam all \add his\add* days. And Roboam died with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abia his son reigned in his stead. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 In the eighteenth year of the reign of Jeroboam Abia began to reign over Juda. 
\v 2 He reigned three years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name \add was\add* Maacha, daughter of Uriel of Gabaon. And there was war between Abia and Jeroboam. 
\v 3 And Abia set the battle in array with an army, with mighty men of war, \add even\add* four hundred thousand mighty men: and Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand, \add they were\add* mighty warriors of the host. 
\v 4 And Abia rose up from the mount Somoron, which is in mount Ephraim, and said, Hear you⌃, Jeroboam, and all Israel: 
\v 5  \add Is it\add* not for you to know that the Lord God of Israel has given a king over Israel for ever to David, and to his sons, by a covenant of salt? 
\v 6 But Jeroboam the \add son\add* of Nabat, the servant of Solomon \add the son\add* of David, is risen up, and has revolted from his master: 
\v 7 and there are gathered to him pestilent men, transgressors, and he has risen up against Roboam the \add son\add* of Solomon, while Roboam was young and fearful in heart, and he withstood him not. 
\v 8 And now you⌃ profess to resist the kingdom of the Lord in the hand of the sons of David; and you⌃ \add are\add* a great multitude, and with you are golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for gods. 
\v 9 Did you⌃ not cast out the priests of the Lord, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and make to yourselves priests of the people of any \add other\add* land? whoever came to consecrate himself with a calf of the heard and seven rams, he forthwith became a priest to that which is no god. 
\v 10 But we have not forsaken the Lord our God, and his priests, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, minister to the Lord; and in their daily courses 
\v 11 they sacrifice to the Lord whole burnt offering, morning and evening, and compound incense, and \add set\add* the show bread on the pure table; and \add there is\add* the golden candlestick, and the lamps for burning, to light in the evening: for we keep the charge of the Lord God of our fathers; but you⌃ have forsaken him. 
\v 12 And, behold, the Lord and his priests are with us at our head, and the signal trumpets to sound an alarm over us. Children of Israel, fight not against the Lord God of our fathers; for you⌃ shall not prosper. 
\v 13 Now Jeroboam had caused an ambush to come round upon him from behind: and he \add himself\add* was before Juda, and the ambush behind. 
\v 14 And Juda looked back, and, behold, the battle \add was\add* against them before and behind: and they cried to the Lord, and the priests sounded with the trumpets. 
\v 15 And the men of Juda shouted: and it came to pass, when the men of Juda shouted, that the Lord struck Jeroboam and Israel before Abia and Juda. 
\v 16 And the children of Israel fled from before Juda; and the Lord delivered them into their hands. 
\v 17 And Abia and his people struck them with a great slaughter: and there fell slain of Israel five hundred thousand mighty men. 
\v 18 So the children of Israel were brought low in that day, and the children of Juda prevailed, because they trusted on the Lord God of their fathers. 
\v 19 And Abia pursued after Jeroboam, and he took from him the cities, Baethel and her towns, and Jesyna and her towns, and Ephron and her towns. 
\v 20 And Jeroboam did not recover strength again all the days of Abia: and the Lord struck him, and he died. 
\v 21 But Abia strengthened himself, and took to himself fourteen wives, and he begot twenty-two sons, and sixteen daughters. 
\v 22 And the rest of the acts of Abia, and his deeds, and his sayings, are written in the book of the prophet Addo. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1 And Abia died with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David; and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In the days of Asa the land of Juda had rest ten years. 
\v 2 And he did that which was good and right in the sight of the Lord his God. 
\v 3 And he removed the altars of the strange \add gods\add*, and the high places, and broke the pillars in pieces, and cut down the groves: 
\v 4 and he told Juda to seek earnestly the Lord God of their fathers, and to perform the law and commandments. 
\v 5 And he removed from all the cities of Juda the altars and the idols, and established in quietness 
\v 6 fortified cities in the land of Juda; for the land was quiet, and he had no war in these years; for the Lord gave him rest. 
\v 7 And he said to Juda, Let us fortify these cities, and make walls, and towers, and gates, and bars: we shall prevail over the land, for as we have sought out the Lord our God, he has sought out us, and has given us rest round about, and prospered us. 
\v 8 And Asa had a force of armed men bearing shields and spears in the land of Juda, \add even\add* three hundred thousand, and in the land of Benjamin two hundred and eighty thousand targeteers and archers: all these were mighty warriors. 
\v 9 And Zare the Ethiopian went out against them, with a force of a million, and three hundred chariots; and came to Maresa. 
\v 10 And Asa went out to meet him, and set the battle in array in the valley north of Maresa. 
\v 11 And Asa cried to the Lord his God, and said, O Lord, it is not impossible with you to save by many or by few: strengthen us, O Lord our God; for we trust in you, and in your name have we come against this great multitude. O Lord our God, let not man prevail against you. 
\v 12 And the Lord struck the Ethiopians before Juda; and the Ethiopians fled. 
\v 13 And Asa and his people pursued them to Gedor; and the Ethiopians fell, so that they could not recover themselves; for they were crushed before the Lord, and before his host; and they took many spoils. 
\v 14 And they destroyed their towns roundabout Gedor; for a terror of the Lord was upon them: and they spoiled all their cities, for they had much spoil. 
\v 15 Also they destroyed the tents of cattle, and the Alimazons, and took many sheep and camels, and returned to Jerusalem. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1 And Azarias the son of Oded—upon him came the Spirit of the Lord, 
\v 2 and he went out to meet Asa, and all Juda and Benjamin, and said, Hear me, Asa, and all Juda and Benjamin. The Lord \add is\add* with you, while you⌃ are with him; and if you⌃ seek him out, he will be found of you; but if you⌃ forsake him, he will forsake you. 
\v 3 And Israel \add has been\add* a long time without the true God, and without a priest to expound \add the truth\add*, and without the law. 
\v 4 But he shall turn them to the Lord God of Israel, and he will be found of them. 
\v 5 And in that time there is no peace to one going out, or to one coming in, for the terror of the Lord is upon all that inhabit the lands. 
\v 6 And nation shall fight against nation, and city against city; for God has confounded them with every \add kind of\add* affliction. 
\v 7 But be you⌃ strong, and let not your hands be weakened: for there is a reward for your work. 
\v 8 And when \add Asa\add* heard these words, and the prophesy of Adad the prophet, then he strengthened himself, and cast out the abominations from all the land of Juda and Benjamin, and from the cities which Jeroboam possessed, in mount Ephraim, and he renewed the altar of the Lord, which was before the temple of the Lord. 
\v 9 And he assembled Juda and Benjamin, and the strangers that lived with him, of Ephraim, and of Manasse, and of Symeon: for many of Israel were joined to him, when they saw that the Lord his God was with him. 
\v 10 And they assembled at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa. 
\v 11 And he sacrificed to the Lord in that day of the spoils which they brought, seven hundred calves and seven thousand sheep. 
\v 12 And he entered into a covenant that they should seek the Lord God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul. 
\v 13 And that whoever should not seek the Lord God of Israel, should die, whether young or old, whether man or woman. 
\v 14 And they swore to the Lord with a loud voice, and with trumpets, and with cornets. 
\v 15 And all Juda rejoiced concerning the oath: for they swore with all their heart, and they sought him with all their desires; and he was found of them: and the Lord gave them rest round about. 
\v 16 And he removed Maacha his mother from being priestess to Astarte; and he cut down the idol, and burnt it in the brook of Kedron. 
\v 17 Nevertheless they removed not the high places: they still existed in Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days. 
\v 18 And he brought in the holy things of David his father, and the holy things of the house of God, silver, and gold, and vessels. 
\v 19 And there was no war \add waged\add* with him until the thirty-fifth year of the reign of Asa. 
\c 16  
\p
\v 1 And in the thirty-eighth year of the reign of Asa, the king of Israel went up against Juda, and built Rama, so as not to allow egress or ingress to Asa king of Juda. 
\v 2 And Asa took silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the Lord, and of the king's house, and sent \add them\add* to the son of Ader king of Syria, which lived in Damascus, saying, 
\v 3 Make a covenant between me and you, and between my father and your father: behold, I have sent you gold and silver: come, and turn away from me Baasa king of Israel, and let him depart from me. 
\v 4 And the son of Ader listened to king Asa, and sent the captains of his host against the cities of Israel; and struck Aeon, and Dan, and Abelmain, and all the country round Nephthali. 
\v 5 And it came to pass when Baasa heard \add it\add* he left off building Rama, and put a stop to his work: 
\v 6 then king Asa took all Juda, and took the stones of Rama, and its timber, \add with\add* which Baasa \add had\add* built; and he built with them Gabae and Maspha. 
\v 7 And at that time came Anani the prophet to Asa king of Juda, and said to him, Because you did trust on the king of Syria, and did not trust on the Lord your God, therefore the army of Syria is escaped out of your hand. 
\v 8 Were not the Ethiopians and Libyans a great force, in courage, in horsemen, in great numbers? and did not He deliver them into your hands, because you trusted in the Lord? 
\v 9 For the eyes of the Lord look upon all the earth, to strengthen every heart that is perfect towards him. In this you have done foolishly; henceforth there shall be war with you. 
\v 10 And Asa was angry with the prophet, and put him in prison, for he was angry at this: and Asa vexed some of the people at that time. 
\v 11 And, behold, the acts of Asa, the first and the last, \add are\add* written in the book of the kings of Juda and Israel. 
\v 12 And Asa was diseased \add in\add* his feet in the thirty-ninth year of his reign, until he was very ill: but in his disease he sought not to the Lord, but to the physicians. 
\v 13 And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the fortieth year of his reign. 
\v 14 And they buried him in the sepulchre which he had dug for himself in the city of David, and they laid him on a bed, and filled \add it\add* with spices and \add all\add* kinds of perfumes of the apothecaries; and they made for him a very great funeral. 
\c 17  
\p
\v 1 And Josaphat his son reigned in his stead, Josaphat strengthened himself against Israel. 
\v 2 And he put garrisons in all the strong cities of Juda, and appointed captains in all the cities of Juda, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken. 
\v 3 And the Lord was with Josaphat, for he walked in the first ways of his father, and did not seek to idols; 
\v 4 but he sought to the Lord God of his father, and walked in the commandments of his father, and not according to the works of Israel. 
\v 5 And the Lord prospered the kingdom in his hand; and all Juda gave gifts to Josaphat; and he had great wealth and glory. 
\v 6 And his heart was exalted in the way of the Lord; and he removed the high places and the groves from the land of Juda. 
\v 7 And in the third year of his reign, he sent his chief men, and his mighty men, Abdias and Zacharias, and Nathanael, and Michaias, to teach in the cities of Juda. 
\v 8 And with them \add were\add* the Levites, Samaias, and Nathanias, and Zabdias, and Asiel, and Semiramoth, and Jonathan, and Adonias, and Tobias, and Tobadonias, Levites, and with them Elisama and Joram, the priests. 
\v 9 And they taught in Juda, and \add there was\add* with them the book of the law of the Lord, and they passed through the cities of Juda, and taught the people. 
\v 10 And a terror of the Lord was upon all the kingdoms of the land round about Juda, and they made no war against Josaphat. 
\v 11 And \add some\add* of the Philistines brought to Josaphat gifts, and silver, and presents; and the Arabians brought him seven thousand and seven hundred rams. 
\v 12 And Josaphat increased in greatness exceedingly, and built in Judea places of abode, and strong cities. 
\v 13 And he had many works in Judea: and the mighty men of war, \add the men\add* of strength, \add were\add* in Jerusalem. 
\v 14 And this \add is\add* their number according to the houses of their fathers; even the captains of thousands in Juda \add were\add*, Ednas the chief, and with him mighty men of strength three hundred thousand. 
\v 15 And after him, Joanan the captain, and with him two hundred and eighty thousand. 
\v 16 And after him Amasias the \add son\add* of Zari, who was zealous for the Lord; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of strength. 
\v 17 And out of Benjamin \add there was\add* a mighty man of strength, even Eliada, and with him two hundred thousand archers and targeteers. 
\v 18 And after him Jozabad, and with him one hundred and eighty thousand mighty men of war. 
\v 19 These were the king's servants besides those whom the king put in the strong cities in all Judea. 
\c 18  
\p
\v 1 And Josaphat had yet great wealth and glory, and he connected himself by marriage with the house of Achaab. 
\v 2 And he went down after a term of years to Achaab to Samaria: and Achaab killed for him sheep and calves, in abundance, and for the people with him, and he much desired him to go up with him to Ramoth of the country of Galaad. 
\v 3 And Achaab king of Israel said to Josaphat king of Juda, Will you go with me to Ramoth of the country of Galaad? And he said to him, As I \add am\add*, so also \add are\add* you, as your people, \add so\add* also \add is\add* my people with you for the war. 
\v 4 And Josaphat said to the king of Israel, Seek, I pray you, the Lord today. 
\v 5 And the king of Israel gathered the prophets, four hundred men, and said to them, Shall I go to Ramoth Galaad to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up, and God shall deliver \add it\add* into the hands of the king. 
\v 6 And Josaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the Lord besides, that we may enquire of him? 
\v 7 And the king of Israel said to Josaphat, There is yet one man by whom to enquire of the Lord; but I hate him, for he does not prophesy concerning me for good, for all his days \add are\add* for evil: this \add is\add* Michaias the son of Jembla. And Josaphat said, Let not the king say so. 
\v 8 And the king called an eunuch, and said, \add Fetch\add* quickly Michaias the son of Jembla. 
\v 9 And the king of Israel and Josaphat king of Juda were sitting each on his throne, and clothed in their robes, sitting in the open space at the entrance of the gate of Samaria: and all the prophets were prophesying before them. 
\v 10 And Sedekias son of Chanaan made for himself iron horns, and said, Thus says the Lord, With these you shall thrust Syria until it be consumed. 
\v 11 And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth Galaad, and you shall prosper; and the Lord shall deliver it into the hands of the king. 
\v 12 And the messenger that went to call Michaias spoke to him, saying, Behold, the prophets have spoken favourably concerning the king with one mouth; let now, I pray you, your words be as \add the words\add* of one of them, and do you speak good things. 
\v 13 And Michaias said, \add As\add* the Lord lives, whatever God shall say to me, that will I speak. 
\v 14 And he came to the king, and the king said to him, Michaias, shall I go up to Ramoth Galaad to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go up, and you shall prosper, and they shall be given into your hands. 
\v 15 And the king said to him, How often shall I solemnly charge you that you speak to me nothing but truth in the name of the Lord? 
\v 16 And he said, I saw Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep without a shepherd: and the Lord said, These have no commander; let each return to his home in peace. 
\v 17 And the king of Israel said to Josaphat, Said I not to you, that he would not prophesy concerning me good, but evil? 
\v 18 But he said, Not so. Hear you⌃ the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven stood by on his right hand and on his left. 
\v 19 And the Lord said, Who will deceive Achaab king of Israel, that he may go up, and fall in Ramoth Galaad? And one spoke this way, and another spoke that way. 
\v 20 And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the Lord, and said, I will deceive him. And the Lord said, Whereby? 
\v 21 And he said, I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And \add the Lord\add* said, You shall deceive \add him\add*, and shall prevail: go forth, and do so. 
\v 22 And now, behold, the Lord has put a false spirit in the mouth of these your prophets, and the Lord has spoken evil against you. 
\v 23 Then Sedekias the son of Chanaan drew near, and struck Michaias on the cheek, and said to him, By what way passed the Spirit of the Lord from me to speak to you? 
\v 24 And Michaias said, Behold, you shall see in that day, when you shall go from chamber to chamber to hide yourself. 
\v 25 And the king of Israel said, Take Michaias, and carry him back to Emer the governor of the city, and to Joas the captain, the king's son; 
\v 26 and you⌃ shall say, Thus said the king, Put this fellow into the prison house, and let him eat the bread of affliction, and \add drink\add* the water of affliction, until I return in peace. 
\v 27 And Michaias said, If you do at all return in peace, the Lord has not spoken by me. And he said, Hear, all you⌃ people. 
\v 28 So the king of Israel, and Josaphat king of Juda, went up to Ramoth Galaad. 
\v 29 And the king of Israel said to Josaphat, Disguise me, and I will enter into the battle: and do you put on my raiment. so the king of Israel disguised himself, and entered into the battle. 
\v 30 Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that were with him, saying, Fight neither against small nor great, but only against the king of Israel. 
\v 31 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Josaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel: and they compassed him about to fight against him: and Josaphat cried out, and the Lord delivered him; and God turned them away from him. 
\v 32 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned away from him. 
\v 33 And a man drew a bow with a good aim, and struck the king of Israel between the lungs and the breast-plate: and he said to the charioteer, Turn your hand, drive me out of the battle, for I am wounded. 
\v 34 And the battle turned in that day; and the king of Israel remained on the chariot against Syria until evening, and died at sunset. 
\c 19  
\p
\v 1 And Josaphat king of Juda returned to his house at Jerusalem. 
\v 2 And there went out to meet him Jeu the prophet the son of Anani, and said to him, King Josaphat, do you help a sinner, or act friendly towards one hated of the Lord? Therefore has wrath come upon you from the Lord. 
\v 3 Nevertheless \add some\add* good things have been found in you, forasmuch as you did remove the groves from the land of Juda, and did direct your heart to seek after the Lord. 
\v 4 And Josaphat lived in Jerusalem: and he again went out amongst the people from Bersabee to the mount of Ephraim, and turned them back to the Lord God of their fathers. 
\v 5 And he appointed judges in all the strong cities of Juda, city by city. 
\v 6 And he said to the judges, Take good heed what you⌃ do: for you⌃ judge not for man, but for the Lord, and with you are matters of judgement. 
\v 7 And now let the fear of the Lord be upon you, and be wary, and do \add your duty\add*: for there is no unrighteousness with the Lord our God, neither \add is it for him\add* to respect persons, nor take bribes. 
\v 8 Moreover Josaphat appointed in Jerusalem some of the priests, and Levites, and heads of houses of Israel, for the judgement of the Lord, and to judge the dwellers in Jerusalem. 
\v 9 And he charged them, saying, Thus shall you⌃ do in the fear of the Lord, in truth and with a perfect heart. 
\v 10 Whatsoever man of your brethren that dwell in their cities \add shall bring\add* the cause that comes before you, between blood \add and\add* blood, and between precept and commandment, and ordinances and judgements, you⌃ shall even decide for them; so they shall not sin against the Lord, and there shall not be wrath upon you, and upon your brethren: thus you⌃ shall do, and you⌃ shall not sin. 
\v 11 And, behold, Amarias the priest is head over you in every matter of the Lord; and Zabdias the son of Ismael is head over the house of Juda in every matter of the king; and the scribes and Levites are before you: be strong and active, and the Lord shall be with the good. 
\c 20  
\p
\v 1 And after this came the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them \add some\add* of the Minaeans, against Josaphat to battle. 
\v 2 And they came and told Josaphat, saying, There is come against you a great multitude from Syria, from beyond the sea; and, behold, they are in Asasan Thamar, this is Engadi. 
\v 3 And Josaphat was alarmed, and set his face to seek the Lord earnestly, and he proclaimed a fast in all Juda. 
\v 4 And Juda gathered themselves together to seek after the Lord: even from all the cities of Juda they came to seek the Lord. 
\v 5 And Josaphat stood up in the assembly of Juda in Jerusalem, in the house of the Lord, in front of the new court. 
\v 6 And he said, O Lord God of my fathers, are not you God in heaven above, and are not you Lord of all the kingdoms of the nations? and \add is there\add* not in your hand the might of dominion, and there is no one who can resist you? 
\v 7 Are not you the Lord that did destroy the inhabitants of this land before the face of your people Israel, and did give it to your beloved seed of Abraham for ever? 
\v 8 And they lived in it, and built in it a sanctuary to your name, saying, 
\v 9 If there should come upon us evils, sword, judgement, pestilence, famine, we will stand before this house, and before you, (for your name \add is\add* upon this house,) and we will cry to you because of the affliction, and you shall hear, and deliver. 
\v 10 And now, behold, the children of Ammon, and Moab, and mount Seir, with regard to whom you did not permit Israel to pass through their border, when they had come out of the land of Egypt, (for they turned away from them, and did not destroy them;)— 
\v 11 yet now, behold, they make attempts against us, to come forth to cast us out from our inheritance which you gave us. 
\v 12 O Lord our God, will you not judge them? for we have no strength to resist this great multitude that is come against us; and we know not what we shall do to them: but our eyes are towards you. 
\v 13 And all Juda was standing before the Lord, and their children, and their wives. 
\v 14 And Oziel the \add son\add* of Zacharias, of the children of Banaias, of the sons of Eleiel, the sons of Matthanias the Levite, of the sons of Asaph, —upon him came the Spirit of the Lord in the assembly: 
\v 15 and he said, Hear you⌃, all Juda, and the dwellers in Jerusalem, and king Josaphat: Thus says the Lord to you, even you, Fear not, neither be alarmed, before all this great multitude; for the battle is not years, but God's. 
\v 16 To-morrow go you⌃ down against them: behold, they come up by the ascent of Assis, and you⌃ shall find them at the extremity of the river of the wilderness of Jeriel. 
\v 17 It is not for you to fight: understand these things, and see the deliverance of the Lord with you, Juda and Jerusalem: fear not, neither be afraid to go forth to-morrow to meet them; and the Lord shall be with you. 
\v 18 And Josaphat bowed with his face \add to the ground\add* with all Juda and the dwellers in Jerusalem, \add and\add* they fell before the Lord to worship the Lord. 
\v 19 And the Levites of the children of Caath, and \add they\add* of the sons of Core, rose up to praise the Lord God of Israel with a loud voice on high. 
\v 20 And they rose early in the morning and went out to the wilderness of Thecoe: and as they went out, Josaphat stood and cried, and said, Hear me, Juda, and the dwellers in Jerusalem; put your trust in the Lord God, and your trust shall be honoured; trust in his prophet, and you⌃ shall prosper. 
\v 21 And he took counsel with the people, and set appointed men to sing psalms and praises, to give thanks, and sing the holy songs of praise in going forth before the host: and they said, Give thanks to the Lord, for his mercy \add endures\add* for ever. 
\v 22 And when they began the praise and thanksgiving, the Lord caused the children of Ammon to fight against Moab, and \add the inhabitants of\add* mount Seir that came out against Juda; and they were routed. 
\v 23 Then the children of Ammon and Moab rose up against the dwellers in mount Seir, to destroy and consume them; and when they had made an end of \add destroying\add* the inhabitants of Seir, they rose up against one another so that they were utterly destroyed. 
\v 24 And Juda came to the watch-tower of the wilderness, and looked, and saw the multitude, and, behold, \add they were\add* all fallen dead upon the earth, not one escaped. 
\v 25 And Josaphat and his people went out to spoil them, and they found much cattle, and furniture, and spoils, and precious things: and they spoiled them, and they were three days gathering the spoil, for it was abundant. 
\v 26 And it came to pass on the fourth day they were gathered to the Valley of Blessing; for there they blessed the Lord: therefore they called the name of the place the Valley of Blessing, until this day. 
\v 27 And all the men of Juda returned to Jerusalem, and Josaphat led them with great joy; for the Lord gave them joy over their enemies. 
\v 28 And they entered into Jerusalem with lutes and harps and trumpets, \add going\add* into the house of the lord. 
\v 29 And there was a terror of the Lord upon all the kingdoms of the land, when they heard that the Lord fought against the enemies of Israel. 
\v 30 And the kingdom of Josaphat was at peace; and his God gave him rest round about. 
\v 31 And Josaphat reigned over Juda, being thirty-five years \add old\add* when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Azuba, daughter of Sali. 
\v 32 And he walked in the ways of his father Asa, and turned not aside from doing that which was right in the sight of the Lord. 
\v 33 nevertheless the high places yet remained; and as yet the people did not direct their heart to the Lord God of their fathers. 
\v 34 And the rest of the acts of Josaphat, the first and the last, behold, they are written in the history of Jeu \add the son\add* of Anani, who wrote the book of the kings of Israel. 
\v 35 And afterwards Josaphat king of Juda entered into an alliance with Ochozias king of Israel, (now this was an unrighteous man,) 
\v 36 by acting \add with\add* and going to him, to build ships to go to Tharsis: and he built ships in Gasion Gaber. 
\v 37 And Eliezer you \add son\add* of Dodia of Marisa prophesied against Josaphat, saying, Forasmuch as you have allied yourself with Ochozias, the Lord has broken your work, and your vessels have been wrecked. And they could not go to Tharsis. 
\c 21  
\p
\v 1 And Josaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Joran his son reigned in his stead. 
\v 2 And he had brothers, the six sons of Josaphat, Azarias, and Jeiel, and Zacharias, and Azarias, and Michael, and Zaphatias: all these \add were\add* the sons of Josaphat king of Juda. 
\v 3 And their father gave them many gifts, silver, and gold, and arms, together with fortified cities in Juda: but he gave the kingdom to Joram, for he \add was\add* the firstborn. 
\v 4 And Joram entered upon his kingdom, and strengthened himself, and killed all his brothers with the sword, and \add some\add* of the princes of Israel. 
\v 5 When he was thirty and two years old, Joram succeeded to his kingdom, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. 
\v 6 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Achaab; for a daughter of Achaab was his wife: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord: 
\v 7 nevertheless the Lord would not utterly destroy the house of David, because of the covenant which he made with David, and as he said to him that he would give a light to him and his sons for ever. 
\v 8 In those days Edom revolted from Juda, and they made a king over themselves. 
\v 9 And Joram went with the princes, and all the cavalry with him: and it came to pass that he arose by night, and struck Edom that compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots, and the people fled to their tents. 
\v 10 And Edom revolted from Juda until this day. Then Lomna at that time revolted from \add under\add* his hand, because he forsook the Lord God of his fathers. 
\v 11 For he built high places in the cities of Juda, and caused the dwellers in Jerusalem to go a-whoring, and led Juda astray. 
\v 12 And there came to him \add a message\add* in writing from Eliu the prophet, saying, Thus says the Lord God of your father David, Because you have not walked in the way of your father Josaphat, nor in the ways of Asa king of Juda, 
\v 13 but have walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and have caused Juda and the dwellers in Jerusalem to go a-whoring, as the house of Achaab caused \add Israel\add* to go a-whoring, and you have slain your brethren, the sons of your father, who were better than yourself; 
\v 14 behold, the Lord shall strike you with a great plague amongst your people, and your sons, and your wives, and all your store: 
\v 15 and you \add shall be afflicted\add* with a grievous disease, with a disease of the bowels, until your bowels shall fall out day by day with the sickness. 
\v 16 So the Lord stirred up the Philistines against Joram, and the Arabians, and those who bordered on the Aethiopians: 
\v 17 and they went up against Juda, and prevailed against them, and took away all the store which they found in the house of the king, and his sons, and his daughters; and there was no son left to him but Ochozias the youngest of his sons. 
\v 18 And after all these things the Lord struck him in the bowels with an incurable disease. 
\v 19 And it continued from day to day: and when the time of the days came \add to\add* two years, his bowels fell out with the disease, and he died by a grievous distemper: and his people performed no funeral, like the funeral of his fathers. 
\v 20 He was thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. And he departed without honour, and was buried in the city of David, but not in the tombs of the kings. 
\c 22  
\p
\v 1 And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ochozias his youngest son king in his stead: for the band of robbers that came against them, even the Arabians and the Alimazonians, had slain all the elder ones. So Ochozias son of Joram king of Juda reigned. 
\v 2 Ochozias began to reign when he was twenty years old, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Gotholia, the daughter of Ambri. 
\v 3 And he walked in the way of the house of Achaab; for his mother was his counsellor to do evil. 
\v 4 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord as the house of Achaab \add had done\add*: for they were his counsellors after the death of his father to his destruction. 
\v 5 And he walked in their counsels, and he went with Joram son of Achaab king of Israel to war against Azael king of Syria to Ramoth Galaad: and the archers struck Joram. 
\v 6 And Joram returned to Jezrael to be healed of the wounds wherewith the Syrians struck him in Ramoth, when he fought against Azael king of Syria. And Ochozias son of Joram, king of Juda, went down to see Joram the son of Achaab at Jezrael because he was sick. 
\v 7 And destruction from God came upon Ochozias in \add his\add* coming to Joram; for when he had come, Joram went out with him against Jeu the son of Namessei, the anointed of the Lord against the house of Achaab. 
\v 8 And it came to pass, when Jeu was taking vengeance on the house of Achaab, that he found the princes of Juda and the brethren of Ochozias ministering to Ochozias, and he killed them. 
\v 9 And he gave orders to seek Ochozias: and they took him while he was healing his wounds in Samaria, and they brought him to Jeu, and he killed him; and they buried him, for they said, He is the son of Josaphat, who sought the Lord with all his heart. So there was none in the house of Ochozias to secure their power in the kingdom. 
\v 10 And Gotholia the mother of Ochozias saw that her son was dead, and she arose and destroyed all the seed royal in the house of Juda. 
\v 11 But Josabeeth, the daughter of the king, took Joas the son of Ochozias and rescued him secretly out of the midst of the sons of the king that were put to death, and she placed him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So Josabeeth daughter of king Joram, sister of Ochozias, wife of Jodae the priest, hid him, and she \add even\add* hid him from Gotholia, and she did not kill him. 
\v 12 And he was with him hid in the house of God six years; and Gotholia reigned over the land. 
\c 23  
\p
\v 1 And in the eighth year Jodae strengthened \add himself\add*, and took the captains of hundreds, Azarias the son of Joram, and Ismael the son of Joanan, and Azarias the son of Obed, and Maasaeas the son of Adia, and Elisaphan the son of Zacharias, with him to the house of the Lord. 
\v 2 And they went round about Juda, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Juda, and heads of the families of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem. 
\v 3 and all the congregation of Juda made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he showed them the king's son, and said to them, Behold, let the king's son reign, as the Lord said concerning the house of David. 
\v 4 Now this \add is\add* the thing which you⌃ shall do. Let a third part of you, \add even\add* of the priests and of the Levites, enter in on the sabbath, even into the gates of the entrances; 
\v 5 and let a third part be in the house of the king; and another third at the middle gate: and all the people in the courts of the Lord's house. 
\v 6 And let not \add any one\add* enter into the house of the Lord, except the priests and the Levites, and the servants of the Levites; they shall enter in, because they are holy: and let all the people keep the watch of the Lord. 
\v 7 And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man's weapon in his hand; and whoever \add else\add* goes into the house shall die: but they shall be with the king when he goes out, and when he comes in. 
\v 8 And the Levites and all Juda did according to all that the priest Jodae commanded them, and they took each his men from the beginning of the sabbath to the end of the sabbath, for Jodae the priest did not dismiss the courses. 
\v 9 And Jodae gave to the men the swords, and the shields, and the arms, which \add had\add* belonged to King David, in the house of God. 
\v 10 And he set the whole people, every man with his arms, from the right side of the house to the left side of the altar and the house, over against the king round about. 
\v 11 And he brought out the king's son, and put on him the crown and the testimony, and Jodae the priest and his sons proclaimed him king, and anointed him, and said, Long live the king! 
\v 12 And Gotholia heard the sound of the people running, and acknowledging and praising the king: and she went in to the king into the house of the Lord. 
\v 13 And she looked, and, behold, the king \add stood\add* in his place, and the princes and trumpets were at the entrance, and the princes were round the king: and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded the trumpets, and there were the singers singing with instruments, and singing hymns of praise. and Gotholia tore her robe, and cried, you⌃ surely are plotting against \add me\add*. 
\v 14 And Jodae the priest went forth, and Jodae the priest charged the captains of hundreds, even the captains of the host, and said to them, Thrust her forth outside the house, and follow her, and let her be slain with the sword. For the priest said, Let her not be slain in the house of the Lord. 
\v 15 So they let her go \add out\add*; and she went through the horsemen's gate of the house of the king, and they killed her there. 
\v 16 And Jodae made a covenant between himself, and the people, and the king, that the people should be the Lord's. 
\v 17 And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and tore down it and its altars, and they ground his images to powder, and they killed Matthan the priest of Baal before his altars. 
\v 18 And Jodae the priest committed the works of the house of the Lord into the and of the priests and Levites, and he re-established the courses of the priests and Levites which David appointed over the house of the Lord, and \add he appointed them\add* to offer whole burnt offerings to the Lord, as it is written in the law of Moses, with gladness, and with songs by the hand of David. 
\v 19 And the porters stood at the gates of the house of the Lord, that no one unclean in any respect should enter in. 
\v 20 And he took the heads of families, and the mighty men, and the chiefs of the people, and all the people of the land, and they conducted the king into the house of the Lord; and he went through the inner gate into the king's house, and they seated the king on the throne of the kingdom. 
\v 21 And all the people of the land rejoiced; and the city was quiet: and they killed Gotholia. 
\c 24  
\p
\v 1 Joas was seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Sabia of Bersabee. 
\v 2 And Joas did that which right in the sight of the Lord all the days of Jodae the priest. 
\v 3 And Jodae took to himself two wives, and they bore sons and daughters. 
\v 4 And it came to pass afterward that it came into the heart of Joas to repair the house of the Lord. 
\v 5 And he gathered the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out into the cities of Juda, and collect money of all Israel to repair the house of the Lord from year to year, and make haste to speak \add of it\add*. But the Levites hasted not. 
\v 6 And king Joas called Jodae the chief, and said to him, Why have you not looked after the Levites, so that they should bring from Juda and Jerusalem that which was prescribed by Moses the man of God, when he assembled Israel at the tabernacle of witness? 
\v 7 For Gotholia was a transgressor, and her sons tore down the house of God; for they offered the holy things of the house of the Lord to Baalim. 
\v 8 And the king said, Let a box be made, and let it be put at the gate of the house of the Lord without. 
\v 9 And let \add men\add* proclaim in Juda an in Jerusalem, that \add the people\add* should bring to the Lord, as Moses the servant of God spoke concerning Israel in the wilderness. 
\v 10 And all the princes and all the people gave, and brought in, and cast into the box until it was filled. 
\v 11 And it came to pass, when they brought in the box to the officers of the king by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that the money was more than sufficient, then came the king's scribe, and the officer of the high priest, and emptied the box, and restored it to its place. Thus they did day by day, and collected much money. 
\v 12 And the king and Jodae the priest gave it to the workmen employed in the service of the house of the Lord, and they hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the Lord, also smiths and braziers to repair the house of the Lord. 
\v 13 And the workmen wrought, and the works prospered in their hands, and they established the house of the Lord on its foundation, and strengthened \add it\add*. 
\v 14 And when they had finished \add it\add*, they brought to the king and to Jodae the remainder of the money, and they made vessels for the house of the Lord, vessels of service for whole burnt offerings, and gold and silver \add censers\add*: and they offered up whole burnt offerings in the house of the Lord continually all the days of Jodae. 
\v 15 And Jodae grew old, being full of days, and he died, being one hundred and thirty years old at his death. 
\v 16 And they buried him with the kings in the city of David, because he had dealt well with Israel, and with God and his house. 
\v 17 And it came to pass after the death of Jodae, \add that\add* the princes of Juda went in, and did obeisance to the king. Then the king listened to them. 
\v 18 And they forsook the house of the Lord God of their fathers, and served the Astartes and idols: and there was wrath upon Juda and Jerusalem in that day. 
\v 19 yet he sent prophets to them, to turn them to the Lord; but they listened not: and he testified to them, but they obeyed not. 
\v 20 And the Spirit of God came upon Azarias the son of Jodae the priest, and he stood up above the people, and said, Thus says the Lord, Why do you⌃ transgress the commandments of the Lord? so shall you⌃ not prosper; for you⌃ have forsaken the Lord, and he will forsake you. 
\v 21 And they conspired against him, and stone him by command of king Joas in the court of the Lord's house. 
\v 22 So Joas remembered not the kindness which his father Jodae had exercised towards him, but killed his son. And as he died, he said, The Lord look upon \add it\add*, and judge. 
\v 23 And it came to pass after the end of the year, \add that\add* the host of Syria went up against him, and came against Juda and Jerusalem: and they killed all the chiefs of the people amongst the people, and all their spoils they sent to the king of Damascus. 
\v 24 For the army of Syria came with few men, yet God gave into their hands a very large army, because they had forsaken the God of their fathers; and he brought judgements on Joas. 
\v 25 And after they had departed from him, when they had left him in sore diseases, then his servants conspired against him because of the blood of the son of Jodae the priest, and killed him on his bed, and he died, and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchre of the kings. 
\v 26 And they that conspired against him were Zabed the son of Samaath the Ammanite, and Jozabed the son of Samareth the Moabite. 
\v 27 And all his sons, and the five came to him: and the other \add matters\add*, behold, they are written in the book of the kings. And Amasias his son reigned in his stead.

\v 1 Amasias began to reign when he was twenty and five years old, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name \add was\add* Joadaen of Jerusalem. 
\v 2 And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, but not with a perfect heart. 
\v 3 And it came to pass, when the kingdom was established in his hand, that he killed his servants who had slain the king his father. 
\v 4 But he killed not their sons, according to the covenant of the law of the Lord, as it is written, \add and\add* as the Lord commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, and the sons shall not die for the fathers, but they shall die each for his own sin. 
\v 5 And Amasias assembled the house of Juda, and appointed them according to the houses of their families for captains of thousands and captains of hundreds in all Juda and Jerusalem: and he numbered them from twenty years old and upwards, and found them three hundred thousand able to go out to war, holding spear and shield. 
\v 6 Also he hired of Israel one hundred thousand mighty \add men for\add* one hundred talents of silver. 
\v 7 And there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the host of Israel go with you; for the Lord is not with Israel, \add even\add* all the sons of Ephraim. 
\v 8 For if you shall undertake to strengthen \add yourself\add* with these, then the lord shall put you to flight before the enemies: for it is of the Lord both to strengthen and to put to flight. 
\v 9 And Amasias said to the man of God, But what shall I do \add for\add* the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God said, The Lord can give you much more than these. 
\v 10 And Amasias separated from the army that came to him from Ephraim, that they might go away to their place; and they were very angry with Juda, and they returned to their place with great wrath. 
\v 11 And Amasias strengthened \add himself\add*, and took his people, and went to the valley of salt, and struck there the children of Seir ten thousand. 
\v 12 And the children of Juda took ten thousand prisoners, and they carried them to the top of the precipice, and cast them headlong from the top of the precipice, and they were all dashed to pieces. 
\v 13 And the men of the host whom Amasias sent back so that they should not go with him to battle, \add went\add* and attacked the cities of Juda, from Samaria to Baethoron; and they struck three thousand amongst them, and took much spoil. 
\v 14 And it came to pass, after Amasias had returned from striking Idumea, that he brought home the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up for himself as gods, and bowed down before them, and he sacrificed to them. 
\v 15 And the anger of the Lord came upon Amasias, and he sent him a prophet, and he said to him, Why have you sought the gods of the people, which have not rescued their own people out of your hand? 
\v 16 And it came to pass when the prophet was speaking to him, that he said to him, have I made you king's counsellor? take heed lest you be scourged: and the prophet forebore, and said, I know that \add God\add* is disposed against you to destroy you, because you have done this thing, and have not listened to my counsel. 
\v 17 And Amasias king of Juda took counsel, and sent to Joas, son of Joachaz, son of Jeu, king of Israel, saying, Come, and let us look one another in the face. 
\v 18 And Joas king of Israel sent to Amasias king of Juda, saying, The thistle that was in Libanus sent to the cedar that was in Libanus, saying, Give your daughter to my son to wife; but, behold, your wild beasts of the field that are in Libanus shall come: and the wild beasts did come, and trod down the thistle. 
\v 19 You have said, Behold, I have struck Idumea, and your stout heart exalts you: now stay at home; for why do you implicate yourself in mischief, that you should fall, and Juda with you. 
\v 20 Nevertheless Amasias listened not, for it was of the Lord to deliver him into \add the enemy's\add* hands, because he sought after the gods of the Idumeans. 
\v 21 So Joas king of Israel went up; and they saw one another, he and Amasias king of Juda, in Baethsamys, which is of Juda. 
\v 22 And Juda was put to flight before Israel, and they fled every man to his tent. 
\v 23 And Joas king of Israel took prisoner Amasias king of Juda, \add son\add* of Joas, son of Joachaz, in Baethsamys, and brought him to Jerusalem; and he pulled down \add part\add* of the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits. 
\v 24 And \add he took\add* all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of the Lord and with Abdedom, and the treasures of the king's house, and the hostages, and he returned to Samaria. 
\v 25 And Amasias the \add son\add* of Joas king of Juda lived after the death of Joas the \add son\add* of Joachaz king of Israel fifteen years. 
\v 26 And the rest of the acts of Amasias, the first and the last, Behold! are they not written in the book of the kings of Juda and Israel? 
\v 27 And at the time when Amasias departed from the Lord, then they formed a conspiracy against him; and he fled from Jerusalem to Lachis: and they sent after him to Lachis, and killed him there. 
\v 28 And they took him up on horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of David. 
\c 26  
\p
\v 1 Then all the people of the land took Ozias, and he was sixteen years old, and they made him king in the room of his father Amasias. 
\v 2 He built Aelath, he recovered it to Juda, after the king slept with his fathers. 
\v 3 Ozias began to reign at the age of sixteen years, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Jechelia of Jerusalem. 
\v 4 And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that Amasias his father did. 
\v 5 And he sought the Lord in the days of Zacharias, who understood the fear of the Lord; and in his days he sought the Lord, and the Lord prospered him. 
\v 6 And he went out and fought against the Philistines, and pulled down the walls of Geth, and the walls of Jabner, and the walls of Azotus, and he built cities \add near\add* Azotus, and amongst the Philistines. 
\v 7 And the Lord strengthened him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that lived on the rock, and against the Minaeans. 
\v 8 And the Minaeans gave gifts to Ozias; and his fame spread as far as the entering in of Egypt, for he strengthened \add himself\add* exceedingly. 
\v 9 And Ozias built towers in Jerusalem, both at the gate of the corners, and at the valley gate, and at the corners and he fortified them. 
\v 10 And he built towers in the wilderness, and dug many wells, for he had many cattle in the low country and in the plain; and vinedressers in the mountain country and in Carmel: for he was a husbandman. 
\v 11 And Ozias had a host of warriors, and that went out orderly to war, and returned orderly in number; and their number was \add made\add* by the hand of Jeiel the scribe, and Maasias the judge, by the hand of Ananias the king's deputy. 
\v 12 The whole number of the chiefs of families of the mighty men of war \add was\add* two thousand and six hundred; 
\v 13 and with them was a warrior force, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred: these waged war mightily to help the king against \add his\add* enemies. 
\v 14 And Ozias prepared for them, \add even\add* for all the host, shields, and spears, and helmets, and breastplates, and bows, and slings for stones. 
\v 15 And he made in Jerusalem machines invented by a wise contriver, to be upon the towers and upon the corners, to cast darts and great stones: and \add the fame\add* of their preparation was heard at a distance; for he was wonderfully helped, till he was strong. 
\v 16 And when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction; and he transgressed against the Lord his God, and went into the temple of the Lord to turn incense on the altar of incense. 
\v 17 And there went in after him Azarias the priest, and with him eighty priests of the Lord, mighty men. 
\v 18 And they withstood Ozias the king, and said to him, \add It is\add* not for you, Ozias, to burn incense to the Lord, but only for the priests the sons of Aaron, who are consecrated to sacrifice: go forth of the sanctuary, for you have departed from the Lord; and this shall not be for glory to you from the Lord god. 
\v 19 And Ozias was angry, and in his hand \add was\add* the censer to burn incense in the temple: and when he was angry with the priests, then the leprosy rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the Lord, over the altar of incense. 
\v 20 And Azarias the chief priest, and the \add other\add* priests, turned \add to look\add* at him, and, behold, he \add was\add* leprous in his forehead; and they got him hastily out thence, for he also hasted to go out, because the Lord had rebuked him. 
\v 21 And Ozias the king was a leper to the day of his death, and he lived \add as\add* a leper in a separate house; for he was cut off from the house of the Lord: and Joathan his son \add was set\add* over his kingdom, judging the people of the land. 
\v 22 And the rest of the acts of Ozias, the first and the last, \add are\add* written by Jessias the prophet. 
\v 23 And Ozias slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial \add place\add* of the kings, for they said, He is a leper; and Joatham his son reigned in his stead. 
\c 27  
\p
\v 1 Joatham \add was\add* twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name \add was\add* Jerusa, daughter of Sadoc. 
\v 2 And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his father Ozias did: but he went not into the temple of the Lord. And still the people corrupted themselves. 
\v 3 He built the high gate of the house of the Lord, and he built much in the wall of Opel. 
\v 4 In the mountain of Juda, and in the woods, \add he built\add* both dwelling-places and towers. 
\v 5 He fought against the king of the children of Ammon, and prevailed against him: and the children of Ammon gave him even annually one hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. These the king of the children of Ammon brought to him annually in the first and second and third years. 
\v 6 Joatham grew strong, because he prepared his ways before the Lord his God. 
\v 7-8 And the rest of the acts of Joatham, and his war, and his deeds, behold, \add they are\add* written in the book of the kings of Juda and Israel. 
\v 9 And Joatham slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Achaz his son reigned in his stead. 
\c 28  
\p
\v 1 Achaz was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and he did not that which was right in the sight of the Lord, as David his father. 
\v 2 But he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, for he made graven images. 
\v 3 And \add he sacrificed\add* to their idols in the valley of Benennom, and passed his children through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen, whom the Lord cast out from before the children of Israel. 
\v 4 And he burnt incense upon the high places, and upon the roofs, and under every shady tree. 
\v 5 And the Lord his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and he struck him, and took captive of them a great band of prisoners, and carried him to Damascus. Also \add God\add* delivered him into the hands of the king of Israel, who struck him with a great slaughter. 
\v 6 And Phakee the son of Romelias king of Israel, killed in Juda in one day one hundred and twenty thousand mighty men; because they had forsaken the Lord God of their fathers. 
\v 7 And Zechri, a mighty man of Ephraim, killed Maasias the king's son, and Ezrican the chief of his house, and Elcana the king's deputy. 
\v 8 And the children of Israel took captive of their brethren three hundred thousand, women, and sons, and daughters, and they spoiled them of much property, and brought the spoils to Samaria. 
\v 9 And there was there a prophet of the Lord, his name \add was\add* Oded: and he went out to meet the host that were coming to Samaria, and said to them, Behold, the wrath of the Lord God of your fathers \add is\add* upon Juda, and he has delivered them into your hands, and you⌃ have slain them in wrath, and it has reached even to heaven. 
\v 10 And now you⌃ talk of keeping the children of Juda and Jerusalem for servants and handmaidens. Behold, am I not with you to testify for the Lord your God? 
\v 11 And now listen to me, and restore the prisoners of your brethren whom you⌃ have taken: for the fierce anger of the Lord \add is\add* upon you. 
\v 12 And the chiefs of the sons of Ephraim rose up, Udias the son of Joanas, and Barachias the son of Mosolamoth, and Ezekias the son of Sellem, and Amasias the son of Eldai, against those that came from the war, 
\v 13 and said to them, You⌃ shall not bring in hither the prisoners to us, for whereas sin against the Lord \add is\add* upon us, you⌃ mean to add to our sins, and to our trespass: for our sin \add is\add* great, and the fierce anger of the Lord \add is\add* upon Israel. 
\v 14 So the warriors left the prisoners and the spoils before the princes and all the congregation. 
\v 15 And the men who were called by name rose up, and took hold of the prisoners, and clothed all the naked from the spoils, and gave them garments and shoes, and gave them \add food\add* to eat, and \add oil\add* to anoint themselves \add with\add*, and they helped also every one that was weak with asses, and placed them in Jericho, the city of palm-trees, with their brethren; and they returned to Samaria. 
\v 16 At that time king Achaz sent to the king of Assyria to help him, and on this occasion, 
\v 17 because the Idumeans had attacked \add him\add*, and struck Juda, and taken a number of prisoners. 
\v 18 Also the Philistines had made an attack on the cities of the plain country, and the cities of the south of Juda, and taken Baethsamys, and \add the things in the house of the Lord, and the things in the house of the king, and of the princes: and they gave to the king\add* Aelon, and Galero, and Socho and her villages, and Thamna and her villages, and Gamzo and her villages: and they lived there. 
\v 19 For the Lord humbled Juda because of Achaz king of Juda, because he grievously departed from the Lord. 
\v 20 And there came against him Thalgaphellasar king of Assyria, and he afflicted him. 
\v 21 And Achaz took the things \add that were\add* in the house of the Lord, and the things in the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave them to the king of Assyria: but he was no help to him, 
\v 22 but only \add troubled him\add* in his affliction: and he departed yet more from the Lord, and king Achaz said, 
\v 23 I will seek after the gods of Damascus that strike me. And he said, Forasmuch as the gods of the king of Syria themselves strengthen them, therefore will I sacrifice to them, and they will help me. But they became a stumbling block to him, and to all Israel. 
\v 24 And Achaz removed the vessels of the house of the Lord, and cut them in pieces, and shut the doors of the house of the Lord, and made to himself altars in every corner in Jerusalem: 
\v 25 and in each several city in Juda he made high places to burn incense to strange gods: and they provoked the Lord God of their fathers. 
\v 26 And the rest of his acts, and his deeds, the first and the last, behold, \add they are\add* written in the book of the kings of Juda and Israel. 
\v 27 And Achaz slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David; for they did not bring him into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel: and Ezekias his son reigned in his stead. 
\c 29  
\p
\v 1 And Ezekias began to reign at the age of twenty-five years, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Abia, daughter of Zacharias. 
\v 2 And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his father David had done. 
\v 3 And it came to pass, when he was established over his kingdom, in the first month, he opened the doors of the house of the Lord, and repaired them. 
\v 4 And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and put them on the east side, 
\v 5 and said to them, Hear, you⌃ Levites: now sanctify yourselves, and sanctify the house of the Lord God of your fathers, and cast out the impurity from the holy places. 
\v 6 For our fathers have revolted, and done that which was evil before the Lord our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their face from the tabernacle of the Lord, and have turned \add their\add* back. 
\v 7 And they have shut up the doors of the temple, and put out the lamps, and have not burnt incense, and have not offered whole burnt offerings in the holy \add place\add* to the God of Israel. 
\v 8 And the Lord was very angry with Juda and Jerusalem, and made them an astonishment, and a desolation, and a hissing, as you⌃ see with your eyes. 
\v 9 And, behold, your fathers have been struck with the sword, and your sons and your daughters and your wives are in captivity in a land not their own, as it is even now. 
\v 10 Therefore it is now in my heart to make a covenant, a covenant with the Lord God of Israel, that he may turn away his fierce wrath from us. 
\v 11 And now be not lacking \add to your duty\add*, for the Lord has chosen you to stand before him to minister, and to be ministers and burners of incense to him. 
\v 12 Then the Levites rose up, Maath the son of Amasi, and Joel the son of Azarias, of the sons of Caath: and of the sons of Merari, Kis the son of Abdi, and Azarias the son of Haelel: and of the sons of Gedsoni, Jodaad the son of Zemmath, and Joadam: these \add were\add* the sons of Joacha. 
\v 13 And of the sons of Elisaphan; Zambri, and Jeiel: and of the sons of Asaph; Zacharias, and Matthanias: 
\v 14 and of the sons of Aeman; Jeiel, and Semei: and of the sons of Idithun; Samaisa, and Oziel. 
\v 15 And they gathered their brethren, and they purified themselves according to the king's command by the order of the Lord, to purify the house of the Lord. 
\v 16 And the priests entered into the house of the Lord, to purify \add it\add*, and they cast out all the uncleanness that was found in the house of the Lord, even into the court of the house of the Lord: and the Levites received \add it\add* to cast into the brook of Kedron without. 
\v 17 And \add Ezekias\add* began on the first day, \add even\add* on the new moon of the first month, to purify, and on the eighth day of the month they entered into the temple of the Lord: and they purified the house of the Lord in eight days; and on the thirteenth day of the first month they finished \add the work\add*. 
\v 18 And they went in to king Ezekias, and said, We have purified all the things in the house of the Lord, the altar of whole burnt offering, and its vessels, and the table of show-bread, and its vessels; 
\v 19 and all the vessels which king Achaz polluted in his reign, in his apostasy, we have prepared and purified: behold, they are before the altar of the Lord. 
\v 20 And king Ezekias rose early in the morning, and gathered the chief men of the city, and went up to the house of the Lord. 
\v 21 And he brought seven calves, seven rams, seven lambs, seven kids of goats for a sin-offering, for the kingdom, and for the holy things, and for Israel: and he told the priests the sons of Aaron to go up to the altar of the Lord. 
\v 22 And they killed the calves, and the priests received the blood, and poured it on the altar: and they killed the rams, and poured the blood upon the altar: also they killed the lambs, and poured the blood round the altar. 
\v 23 And they brought the goats for a sin-offering before the king and the congregation; and laid their hands upon them. 
\v 24 And the priests killed them, and offered their blood as a propitiation on the altar; and they made atonement for all Israel: for the king said, The whole burnt offering, and the sin-offering \add are\add* for all Israel. 
\v 25 And he stationed the Levites in the house of the Lord with cymbals, and lutes, and harps, according to the commandment of king David, and of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet: for by the commandment of the Lord the order \add was\add* in the hand of the prophets. 
\v 26 And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets. 
\v 27 And Ezekias told \add them\add* to offer up the whole burnt offering on the altar: and when they began to offer the whole burnt offering, they began to sing to the Lord, and the trumpets \add accompanied\add* the instruments of David king of Israel. 
\v 28 And all the congregation worshipped, and the psalm-singers \add were\add* singing, and the trumpets sounding, until the whole burnt sacrifice had been completely offered. 
\v 29 And when they had done offering \add it\add*, the king and all that were present bowed, and worshipped. 
\v 30 And king Ezekias and the princes told the Levites to sing hymns to the Lord in the words of David, and of Asaph the prophet: and they sang hymns with gladness, and fell down and worshipped. 
\v 31 Then Ezekias answered and said, Now you⌃ have consecrated yourselves to the Lord, bring near and offer sacrifices of praise in the house of the Lord. And the congregation brought sacrifices and thank-offerings into the house of the Lord; and every one who was ready in his heart \add brought\add* whole burnt offerings. 
\v 32 And the number of the whole burnt offerings which the congregation brought, was seventy calves, one hundred rams, two hundred lambs: all these \add were\add* for a whole burnt offering to the Lord. 
\v 33 And the consecrated calves were six hundred, \add and\add* the sheep three thousand. 
\v 34 But the priests were few, and could not flay the whole burnt offering, so their brethren the Levites helped them, until the work was finished, and until the priests had purified themselves: for the Levites \add more\add* zealously purified \add themselves\add* than the priests. 
\v 35 And the whole burnt offering \add was\add* abundant, with the fat of the complete peace-offering, and the drink-offerings of the whole burnt sacrifice. So the service was established in the house of the Lord. 
\v 36 And Ezekias and all the people rejoiced, because God has prepared the people: for the thing was done suddenly. 
\c 30  
\p
\v 1 And Ezekias sent to all Israel and Juda, and wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasse, that they should come into the house of the Lord to Jerusalem, to keep the passover to the Lord God of Israel. 
\v 2 For the king, and the princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, designed to keep the passover in the second month. 
\v 3 For they could not keep it at that time, because a sufficient number of priest had not purified themselves, and the people was not gathered to Jerusalem. 
\v 4 And the proposal pleased the king and the congregation. 
\v 5 And they established a decree that a proclamation should go through all Israel, from Bersabee to Dan, that they should come and keep the passover to the Lord God of Israel at Jerusalem: for the multitude had not done it lately according to the scripture. 
\v 6 And the posts went with the letters from the king and the princes to all Israel and Juda, according to the command of the king, saying, Children of Israel, return to the Lord God of Abraam, and Isaac, and Israel, and bring back them that have escaped \add even\add* those that were left of the hand of the king of Assyria. 
\v 7 And be not as your fathers, and your brethren, who revolted from the Lord God of their fathers, and he gave them up to desolation, as you⌃ see. 
\v 8 And now harden not your hearts, as your fathers \add did\add*: give glory to the Lord God, and enter into his sanctuary, which he has sanctified for ever: and serve the Lord your God, and he shall turn away \add his\add* fierce anger from you. 
\v 9 For when you⌃ turn to the Lord, your brethren and your children shall be pitied before all that have carried them captives, and he will restore \add you\add* to this land: for the Lord our God is merciful and pitiful, and will not turn away his face from you, if we return to him. 
\v 10 So the posts went through from city to city in mount Ephraim, and Manasse, and as far as Zabulon: and they as it were laughed them to scorn, and mocked them. 
\v 11 But the men of Aser, and \add some\add* of Manasses and of Zabulon, were ashamed, and came to Jerusalem and Juda. 
\v 12 And the hand of the Lord was \add present\add* to give them one heart to come, to do according to the commands of the king and of the princes, by the word of the Lord. 
\v 13 And a great multitude were gathered to Jerusalem to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation. 
\v 14 And they arose, and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all on which they burnt incense to false \add gods\add* they tore down and cast into the brook Kedron. 
\v 15 Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month: and the priests and the Levites repented, and purified \add themselves\add*, and brought whole burnt offerings into the house of the Lord. 
\v 16 And they stood at their post, according to their ordinance, according to the commandment of Moses the man of God: and the priests received the blood from the hand of the Levites. 
\v 17 For a great part of the congregation was not sanctified; and the Levites were \add ready\add* to kill the passover for every one who could not sanctify himself to the Lord. 
\v 18 For the greatest part of the people of Ephraim, and Manasse, and Issachar, and Zabulon, had not purified \add themselves\add*, but ate the passover contrary to the scripture. On this account also Ezekias prayed concerning them, saying, 
\v 19 The good Lord be merciful with regard to every heart that sincerely seeks the Lord God of their fathers, and \add is\add* not \add purified\add* according to the purification of the sanctuary. 
\v 20 And the Lord listened to Ezekias, and healed the people. 
\v 21 And the children of Israel who were present in Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great joy; and they continued to sing hymns to the Lord daily, and the priests and the Levites \add played\add* on instruments to the Lord. 
\v 22 And Ezekias encouraged all the Levites, and those that had good understanding of the Lord: and they completely kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days, offering peace-offerings, and confessing to the Lord God of their fathers. 
\v 23 And the congregation purposed together to keep other seven days: and they kept seven days with gladness. 
\v 24 For Ezekias set apart for Juda, \add even\add* for the congregation, a thousand calves and seven thousand sheep; and the princes set apart for the people a thousand calves and ten thousand sheep: and the holy things of the priests abundantly. 
\v 25 And all the congregation, the priests and the Levites, rejoiced, and all the congregation of Juda, and they that were present of Jerusalem, and the strangers that came from the land of Israel, and the dwellers in Juda. 
\v 26 And there was great joy in Jerusalem: from the days of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not such a feast in Jerusalem. 
\v 27 Then the priests the Levites rose up and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came into his holy dwelling-place, \add even\add* into heaven. 
\c 31  
\p
\v 1 And when all these things were finished, all Israel that were found in the cities of Juda went out, and broke in pieces the pillars, and cut down the groves, and tore down the high places and the altars out of all Judea and Benjamin, also of Ephraim and Manasse, till they made an end: and all Israel returned, every one to his inheritance, and to their cities. 
\v 2 And Ezekias appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites, and the courses of each one according to his ministry, to the priests and to the Levites, for the whole burnt offering, and for the peace-offering, and to praise, and to give thanks, and to minister in the gates, \add and\add* in the courts of the house of the Lord. 
\v 3 And the king's proportion out of his substance \add was appointed\add* for the whole burnt offerings, the morning and the evening one, and the whole burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the feasts that were ordered in the law of the Lord. 
\v 4 And they told the people who lived in Jerusalem, to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be strong in the ministry of the house of the Lord. 
\v 5 And as he gave the command, Israel brought abundantly first fruits of corn, and wine, and oil, and honey, and every fruit of the field: and the children of Israel and Juda brought tithes of everything abundantly. 
\v 6 And they that lived in the cities of Juda themselves also brought tithes of calves and sheep, and tithes of goats, and consecrated them to the Lord their God, and they brought them and laid them in heaps. 
\v 7 In the third month the heaps began to be piled, and in the seventh month they were finished. 
\v 8 And Ezekias and the princes came and saw the heaps, and blessed the Lord, and his people Israel. 
\v 9 Then Ezekias enquired of the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps. 
\v 10 And Azarias the priest, the chief over the house of Sadoc, spoke to him, and said, From the time that the first fruits began to be brought into the house of the Lord, we have eaten and drunk, and left even abundantly; for the Lord has blessed his people, and we have left to this amount. 
\v 11 And Ezekias told them yet farther to prepare chambers for the house of the Lord; and they prepared \add them\add*, 
\v 12 and they brought there the first fruits and the tithes faithfully: and Chonenias the Levite was superintendent over them, and Semei his brother was next. 
\v 13 and Jeiel, and Ozias, and Naeth, and Asael, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Samachia, and Maath, and Banaias, and his sons, were appointed by Chonenias and Semei his brother, as Ezekias the king, and Azarias who was over the house of the Lord commanded. 
\v 14 And Core, the \add son\add* of Jemna the Levite, the porter eastward, \add was\add* over the gifts, to distribute the first fruits of the Lord, and the most holy things, 
\v 15 by the hand of Odom, and Benjamin, and Jesus, and Semei, and Amarias, and Sechonias, by the hand of the priests faithfully, to give to their brethren according to the courses, as well to great as small; 
\v 16 besides the increase of males from three years old and upward, to every one entering into the house of the Lord, \add a portion\add* according to a daily rate, for service in the daily courses of their order. 
\v 17 This \add is\add* the distribution of the priests according to the houses of their families; and the Levites in their daily courses from twenty years old and upward \add were\add* in \add their\add* order, 
\v 18 to assign stations for all the increase of their sons and their daughters, for the whole number: for they faithfully sanctified the holy place. 
\v 19 As for the sons of Aaron that executed the priests' office, —even those from their cities the men in each several city who were named expressly, —\add were appointed\add* to give a portion to every male amongst the priests, and to every one reckoned amongst the Levites. 
\v 20 And Ezekias did so through all Juda, and did that which was good and right before the Lord his God. 
\v 21 And in every work which he began in service in the house of the Lord, and in the law, and in the ordinances, he sought his God with all his soul, and wrought, and prospered. 
\c 32  
\p
\v 1 And after these things and this faithful dealing, came Sennacherim king of the Assyrians, and he came to Juda, and encamped against the fortified cities, and intended to take them for himself. 
\v 2 And Ezekias saw that Sennacherim was come, and \add that\add* his face \add was set\add* to fight against Jerusalem. 
\v 3 And he took counsel with his elders and his mighty \add men\add* to stop the wells of water which were without the city: and they helped him. 
\v 4 And he collected many people, and stopped the wells of water, and the river that flowed through the city, saying, Lest the king of Assyria come, and find much water, and strengthen \add himself\add*. 
\v 5 And Ezekias strengthened \add himself\add*, and built all the wall that had been pulled down, and the towers, and another wall in front without, and fortified the strong place of the city of David, and prepared arms in abundance. 
\v 6 And he appointed captains of war over the people, and they were gathered to \add meet\add* him to the open place of the gate of the valley, and he encouraged them, saying, 
\v 7 Be strong and courageous, and fear not, neither be dismayed before the King of Assyria, and before all the nation that \add is\add* with him: for \add there are\add* more with us than with him. 
\v 8 With him \add are\add* arms of flesh; but with us \add is\add* the Lord our God to save \add us\add*, and to fight our battle. And the people were encouraged at the words of Ezekias king of Juda. 
\v 9 And afterward Sennacherim king of the Assyrians sent his servants to Jerusalem; and \add he went\add* himself against Lachis, and all his army with him, and sent to Ezekias king of Juda, and to all Juda that \add was\add* in Jerusalem, saying, 
\v 10 Thus says Sennacherim king of the Assyrians, On what do you⌃ trust, that you⌃ will remain in the siege in Jerusalem? 
\v 11 Does not Ezekias deceive you, to deliver you to death and famine and thirst, saying, The Lord our God will deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria? 
\v 12 Is not this Ezekias who has taken down his altars and his high places and has spoken to Juda and the dwellers in Jerusalem, saying, You⌃ shall worship before this altar and burn incense upon it? 
\v 13 Know you⌃ not what I and my fathers have done to all the nations of the countries? Could the gods of the nations of all the earth at all rescue their people out of my hand? 
\v 14 Who is there amongst all the gods of those nations whom my fathers utterly destroyed, \add worthy of trust\add*? Could they deliver their people out of my hand, that your God should deliver you out of my hand? 
\v 15 Now then, let not Ezekias deceive you, and let him not make you thus confident, and believe him not: for no god of any kingdom or nation is at all able to deliver his people out of my hand, or the hand of my fathers: therefore your God shall not deliver you out of my hand. 
\v 16 And his servants continued to speak against the Lord God, and against his servant Ezekias. 
\v 17 And he wrote a letter to reproach the Lord God of Israel, and spoke concerning him, saying, As the gods of the nations of the earth have not delivered their people out of my hand, so the God of Ezekias shall by no means deliver his people out of my hand. 
\v 18 And he cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language to the people of Jerusalem on the wall, \add calling them\add* to assist them, and pull down \add the walls\add*, that they might take the city. 
\v 19 And he spoke against the God of Jerusalem, even as against the gods of the nations of the earth, the works of the hands of men. 
\v 20 And king Ezekias and Esaias the prophet the son of Amos prayed concerning these things, and they cried to heaven. 
\v 21 And the Lord sent an angel, and he destroyed every mighty man and warrior, and leader and captain in the camp of the king of Assyria: and he returned with shame of face to his own land and came into the house of his god: and \add some\add* of them that came out of his bowels killed him with the sword. 
\v 22 So the Lord delivered Ezekias and the dwellers in Jerusalem out of the hand of Sennacherim King of Assyria, and out of the hand of all \add his enemies\add*, and gave them rest round about. 
\v 23 And many brought gifts to the Lord to Jerusalem, and presents to Ezekias king of Juda; and he was exalted in the eyes of all the nations after these things. 
\v 24 In those days Ezekias was sick even to death, and prayed to the Lord: and he listened to him, and gave him a sign. 
\v 25 But Ezekias did not recompense the Lord according to the return which he made him, but his heart was lifted up: and wrath came upon him, and upon Juda and Jerusalem. 
\v 26 And Ezekias humbled himself after the exaltation of his heart, he and the dwellers in Jerusalem; and the wrath of the Lord did not come upon them in the days of Ezekias. 
\v 27 And Ezekias had wealth and very great glory: and he made for himself treasuries of gold, and silver, and precious stones, also for spices, and stores for arms, and for precious vessels; 
\v 28 and cities for the produce of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls and mangers for every \add kind of\add* cattle, and folds for flocks; 
\v 29 and cities which he built for himself, and store of sheep and oxen in abundance, for the Lord gave him a very great store. 
\v 30 The same Ezekias stopped up the course of the water of Gion above, and brought the water down straight south of the city of David. And Ezekias prospered in all his works. 
\v 31 Notwithstanding, in regard to the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who were sent to him to enquire of him \add concerning\add* the prodigy which came upon the land, the Lord left him, to try him, to know what was in his heart. 
\v 32 And the rest of the acts of Ezekias, and his kindness, behold, they are written in the prophecy of Esaias the son of Amos the prophet, and in the book of the kings of Juda and Israel. 
\v 33 And Ezekias slept with his fathers, and they buried him in a high place amongst the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all Juda and the dwellers in Jerusalem gave him glory and honour at his death. And Manasses his son reigned in his stead. 
\c 33  
\p
\v 1 Manasses was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem. 
\v 2 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all the abominations of the heathen, whom the Lord destroyed from before the face of the children of Israel. 
\v 3 And he returned and built the high places, which his father Ezekias had pulled down, and set up images to Baalim, and made groves, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them. 
\v 4 And he built altars in the house of the Lord, concerning which the Lord said, In Jerusalem shall be my name for ever. 
\v 5 And he built altars to all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the Lord. 
\v 6 He also passed his children through the fire in the valley of Benennom; and he divined, and used auspices, and sorceries, and appointed those who had divining spirits, and enchanters, and wrought abundant wickedness before the Lord, to provoke him. 
\v 7 And he set the graven \add image\add*, the molten \add statue\add*, the idol which he made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my name for ever; 
\v 8 and I will not again remove the foot of Israel from the land which I gave to their fathers, if only they will take heed to do all things which I have commanded them, according to all the law and the ordinances and the judgements \add given\add* by the hand of Moses. 
\v 9 So Manasses led astray Juda and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, to do evil beyond all the nations which the Lord cast out from before the children of Israel. 
\v 10 And the Lord spoke to Manasses, and to his people: but they listened not. 
\v 11 And the Lord brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, and they took Manasses in bonds, and bound him in fetters, and brought him to Babylon. 
\v 12 And when he was afflicted, he sought the face of the Lord his God, and was greatly humbled before the face of the God of his fathers; 
\v 13 and he prayed to him: and he listened to him, and listened to his cry, and brought him back to Jerusalem to his kingdom: and Manasses knew that the Lord he is God. 
\v 14 And afterward he built a wall without the city of David, from the southwest southward in the valleys and at the entrance through the fish-gate, as men go out by the gate round about, even as far as Opel: and he raised it much, and set captains of the host in all the fortified cities in Juda. 
\v 15 And he removed the strange gods, and the graven \add image\add* out of the house of the Lord, and all the altars which he had built in the mount of the house of the Lord, and in Jerusalem, and without the city. 
\v 16 And he repaired the altar of the Lord, and offered upon it a sacrifice of peace-offering and thank-offering, and he told Juda to serve the Lord God of Israel. 
\v 17 Nevertheless the people still sacrificed on the high places, only to the Lord their God. 
\v 18 And the rest of the acts of Manasses, and his prayer to God, and the words of the seers that spoke to him in the name of the God of Israel, 
\v 19 behold, \add they are\add* in the account of his prayer; and \add God\add* listened to him. And all his sins, and his backslidings, and the spots on which he built the high places, and set there groves and graven images, before he repented, behold, they are written in the books of the seers. 
\v 20 And Manasses slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the garden of his house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead. 
\v 21 Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. 
\v 22 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, as his father Manasses did: and Amon sacrificed to all the idols which his father Manasses had made, and served them. 
\v 23 And he was not humbled before the Lord as his father Manasses was humbled; for his son Amon abounded in transgression. 
\v 24 And his servants conspired against him, and killed him in his house. 
\v 25 And the people of the land killed the men who had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josias his son king in his stead. 
\c 34  
\p
\v 1 Josias was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem. 
\v 2 And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the ways of his father David, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left. 
\v 3 And in the eighth year of his reign, and he \add being\add* yet a youth, he began to seek the Lord God of his father David: and in the twelfth year of his reign he began to purge Juda and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the ornaments for the altars, and the molten images. 
\v 4 And he pulled down the altars of Baalim that were before his face, and the high places that were above them; and he cut down the groves, and the graven images, and broke in pieces the molten images, and reduced them to powder, and cast \add it\add* upon the surface of the tombs of those who \add had\add* sacrificed to them. 
\v 5 And he burnt the bones of the priests upon the altars, and purged Juda and Jerusalem. 
\v 6 And \add he did so\add* in the cities of Manasse, and Ephraim, and Symeon, and Nephthali, and the places round about them. 
\v 7 And he pulled down the altars and the groves, and he cut the idols in small pieces, and cut off all the high places from all the land of Israel, and returned to Jerusalem. 
\v 8 And in the eighteenth year of his reign, after having cleansed the land, and the house, he sent Saphan the son of Ezelias, and Maasa prefect of the city, and Juach son of Joachaz his recorder, to repair the house of the Lord his God. 
\v 9 And they came to Chelcias the high priest, and gave the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites who kept the gate collected of the hand of Manasse and Ephraim, and of the princes, and of every one that was left in Israel, and of the children of Juda and Benjamin, and of the dwellers in Jerusalem. 
\v 10 And they gave it into the hand of the workmen, who were appointed in the house of the Lord, and they gave it to the workmen who wrought in the house of the Lord, to repair and strengthen the house. 
\v 11 They gave \add it\add* also to the carpenters and builders, to buy squared stones, and timber for beams to cover the houses which the kings of Juda had destroyed. 
\v 12 And the men \add were\add* faithfully \add engaged\add* in the works: and over them were superintendents, Jeth and Abdias, Levites of the sons of Merari, and Zacharias and Mosollam, of the sons of Caath, \add appointed\add* to oversee; and every Levite, and every one that understood \add how\add* to play on musical instruments. 
\v 13 And \add overseers were\add* over the burden-bearers, and over all the workmen in the respective works; and of the Levites \add were appointed\add* scribes, and judges, and porters. 
\v 14 And when they brought forth the money that had been brought into the house of the Lord, Chelcias the priest found a book of the law of the Lord \add given\add* by the hand of Moses. 
\v 15 And Chelcias answered and said to Saphan the scribe, I have found a book of the law in the house of the Lord. And Chelcias gave the book to Saphan. 
\v 16 And Saphan brought in the book to the king, and moreover gave an account to the king, \add saying, This is\add* all the money given into the hand of your servants that work. 
\v 17 And they have collected the money that was found in the house of the Lord, and given it into the hand of the overseers, and into the hand of them that do the work. 
\v 18 And Saphan the scribe brought word to the king, saying, Chelcias the priest has given me a book. And Saphan read it before the king. 
\v 19 And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the law, that he tore his garments. 
\v 20 And the king commanded Chelcias, and Achicam the son of Saphan, and Abdom the son of Michaias, and Saphan the scribe, and Asia the servant of the king, saying, 
\v 21 Go, enquire of the Lord for me, and for every one that is left in Israel and Juda, concerning the words of the book that is found: for great is the wrath of the Lord \add which\add* has been kindled amongst us, because our fathers have not listened to the words of the Lord, to do according to all the things written in this book. 
\v 22 And Chelcias went, and \add the others\add* whom the king told, to Olda the prophetess, the wife of Sellem son of Thecoe, son of Aras, who kept the commandments; and she lived in Jerusalem in the second \add quarter\add*: and they spoke to her accordingly. 
\v 23 And she said to them, Thus has the Lord God of Israel said, Tell the man who sent you to me, 
\v 24 Thus says the Lord, Behold, I bring evil upon this place, \add even\add* all the words that are written in the book that was read before the king of Juda: 
\v 25 because they have forsaken me, and burnt incense to strange gods, that they might provoke me by all the works of their hands; and my wrath is kindled against this place, and it shall not be quenched. 
\v 26 And concerning the king of Juda, who sent you to seek the Lord, —thus shall you⌃ say to him, Thus says the Lord God of Israel, \add As for\add* the words which you have heard, 
\v 27 forasmuch as your heart was ashamed, and you were humbled before me when you heard my words against this place, and against the inhabitants of it, and you were humbled before me, and did rend your garments, and did weep before me; I also have heard, says the Lord. 
\v 28 Behold, I \add will\add* gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, and your eyes shall not look upon all the evils which I am bringing upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of it. And they brought back word to the king. 
\v 29 And the king sent and gathered the elders of Juda and Jerusalem. 
\v 30 And the king went up to the house of the Lord, \add he\add* and all Juda, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that were found in the house of the Lord. 
\v 31 And the king stood at a pillar, and made a covenant before the Lord, to walk before the Lord, to keep his commandments and testimonies, and his ordinances, with all \add his\add* heart and with all \add his\add* soul, so as to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book. 
\v 32 And he caused all that were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand; and the inhabitants of Jerusalem made a covenant in the house of the Lord God of their fathers. 
\v 33 And Josias removed all the abominations out of the whole land which belonged to the children of Israel, and caused all that were found in Jerusalem and in Israel, to serve the Lord their God all his days: he departed not from following the Lord God of his fathers. 
\c 35  
\p
\v 1 And Josias kept a passover to the Lord his God; and sacrificed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month. 
\v 2 And he appointed the priests at their charges, and encouraged them for the services of the house of the Lord. 
\v 3 And he told the Levites that were able \add to act\add* in all Israel, that they should consecrate themselves to the Lord: and they put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel built: and the king said, You⌃ must not carry anything on your shoulders: now then minister to the Lord your God, and to his people Israel. 
\v 4 And prepare yourselves according to the houses of your families, and according to your daily courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and \add the order\add* by the hand of his son Solomon. 
\v 5 And stand you⌃ in the house according to the divisions of the houses of your families for your brethren the sons of the people; \add so\add* also let there be for the Levites a division of the house of their family. 
\v 6 And kill you⌃ the passover, and prepare \add it\add* for your brethren, to do according to the word of the Lord, by the hand of Moses. 
\v 7 And Josias gave as an offering to the children of the people, sheep, and lambs, and kids of the young of the goats, all for the passover, \add even for\add* all that were found, in number \add amounting to\add* thirty thousand, and three thousand calves, these \add were\add* of the substance of the king. 
\v 8 And his princes gave an offering to the people, and to the priests, and to the Levites: and Chelcias and Zacharias and Jeiel the chief men gave to the priests of the house of God, they even gave for the passover sheep, and lambs, and kids, two thousand and six hundred, and three hundred calves. 
\v 9 And Chonenias, and Banaeas, and Samaeas, and Nathanael his brother, and Asabias, and Jeiel, and Jozabad, heads of the Levites, gave an offering to the Levites for the passover, of five thousand sheep and five hundred calves. 
\v 10 And the service was duly ordered, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites in their divisions, according to the command of the king. 
\v 11 And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled the blood from their hand, and the Levites flayed \add the victims\add*. 
\v 12 And they prepared the whole burnt offering to give to them, according to the division by the houses of families, \add even\add* to the sons of the people, to offer to the Lord, as it is written in the book of Moses. 
\v 13 And thus \add they did\add* till the morning. And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance; and boiled the holy \add pieces\add* in copper vessels and cauldrons, and \add the feast\add* went on well, and they quickly served all the children of the people. 
\v 14 And after they had prepared for themselves and for the priests, for the priests \add were engaged\add* in offering the whole burnt offerings and the fat until night, then the Levites prepared for themselves, and for their brethren the sons of Aaron. 
\v 15 And the sons of Asaph the psalm-singers \add were\add* at their post according to the commands of David, and Asaph, and Aeman, and Idithom, the prophets of the king: also, the chiefs and the porters of the several gates; —it was not for them to stir from the service of the holy things, for their brethren the Levites prepared for them. 
\v 16 So all the service of the Lord was duly ordered and prepared in that day, for keeping the passover, and offering the whole burnt sacrifices on the altar of the Lord, according to the command of king Josias. 
\v 17 And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days. 
\v 18 And there was no passover like it in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet, or any king of Israel: they kept not such a passover as Josias, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Juda and Israel that were present, and the dwellers in Jerusalem, kept to the Lord. 
\v 19 In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josias this passover was kept, after all these things that Josias did in the house. And king Josias burnt those who had in them a divining spirit, and the wizards, and the images, and the idols, and the sodomites which were in the land of Juda and in Jerusalem, that he might confirm the words of the law that were written in the book which Chelcias the priest found in the house of the Lord. There was no \add king\add* like him before him, who turned to the Lord with all his heart, and all his soul, and all his strength, according to all the law of Moses, and after him there rose up none like him. Nevertheless the Lord turned not from the anger of his fierce wrath, wherewith the Lord was greatly angry against Juda, for all the provocations wherewith Manasses provoked him: and the Lord said, I will even remove Juda also from my presence, as I have removed Israel, and I have rejected the city which I chose, \add even\add* Jerusalem, and thehouse of which I said, My name shall be there. 
\v 20 And Pharao Nechao king of Egypt went up against the king of the Assyrians to the river Euphrates, and king Josias went to meet him. 
\v 21 And he sent messengers to him, saying, What have I to do with you, O king of Juda? I am not come today to war against you; and God has told me to hasten: beware of the God that is with me, lest he destroy you. 
\v 22 However, Josias turned not his face from him, but strengthened himself to fight against him, and listened not to the words of Nechao by the mouth of God, and he came to fight in the plain of Mageddo. 
\v 23 And the archers shot at king Josias; and the king said to his servants, Take me away, for I am severely wounded. 
\v 24 And his servants lifted him out of the chariot, and put him in the second chariot which he had, and brought him to Jerusalem; and he died, and was buried with his fathers: and all Juda and Jerusalem lamented over Josias. 
\v 25 And Jeremias mourned over Josias, and all the chief men and chief women uttered a lamentation over Josias until this day: and they made it an ordinance for Israel, and, behold, it is written in the lamentations. 
\v 26 And the rest of the acts of Josias, and his hope, are written in the law of the Lord. 
\v 27 And his acts, the first and the last, behold, \add they are\add* written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. 
\c 36  
\p
\v 1 And the people of the land took Joachaz the son of Josias, and anointed him, and made him king over Jerusalem in the room of his father. 
\v 2 Joachaz \add was\add* twenty-three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Amital, daughter of Jeremias of Lobna. And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his fathers had done. And Pharao Nechao bound him in Deblatha in the land of Aemath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem. 
\v 3 And the king brought him over to Egypt; and imposed a tribute on the land, one hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold. 
\v 4 And Pharao Nechao made Eliakim the son of Josias king over Juda in the room of his father Josias, and changed his name \add to\add* Joakim. And Pharao Nechao took his brother Joachaz and brought him into Egypt, and he died there: but \add he\add* had given the silver and gold to Pharao. At that time the land began to be taxed to give the money at the command of Pharao; and every one as he could borrowed the silver and the gold of the people of the land, to give to Pharao Nechao. 
\v 5 Joachim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name \add was\add* Zechora, daughter of Nerias of Rama. And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his fathers did. In his days came Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon into the land, and he served him three years, and \add then\add* revolted from him. And the Lord sent against them the Chaldeans, and plundering parties of Syrians, and plundering parties of the Moabites, and of the children of Ammon, and of Samaria; but after this they departed, according to the word of the Lord by the hand of his servants the prophets. Nevertheless the wrath of the Lord was upon Juda, so that they should be removed from his presence, because of the sins of Manasses in all that he did, and for the innocent blood which Joakim shed, for he had filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; yet the Lord would not utterly destroy them. 
\v 6 And Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon came up against him, and bound him with brazen fetters, and carried him away to Babylon. 
\v 7 And he carried away a part of the vessels of the house of the Lord to Babylon, and put them in his temple in Babylon. 
\v 8 And the rest of the acts of Joakim, and all that he did, behold, \add are\add* not these things written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda? And Joakim slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in Ganozae: and Jechonias his son reigned in his stead. 
\v 9 Jechonias \add was\add* eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem, and did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord. 
\v 10 And at the turn of the year, king Nabuchodonosor sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the precious vessels of the house of the Lord, and made Sedekias his father's brother king over Juda and Jerusalem. 
\v 11 Sedekias \add was\add* twenty-one years old when he began to reign, and be reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. 
\v 12 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord his God: he was not ashamed before the prophet Jeremias, nor because of the word of the Lord; 
\v 13 in that he rebelled against king Nabuchodonosor, which he adjured him by God \add not to do\add*: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart, so as not to return to the Lord God of Israel. 
\v 14 And all the great men of Juda, and the priests, and the people of the land transgressed abundantly in the abominations of the heathen, and polluted the house of the Lord which \add was\add* in Jerusalem. 
\v 15 And the Lord God of their fathers sent by the hand of his prophets; rising early and sending his messengers, for he spared his people, and his sanctuary. 
\v 16 Nevertheless they sneered at his messengers, and set at nothing his words, and mocked his prophets, until the wrath of the Lord rose up against his people, till there was no remedy. 
\v 17 And he brought against them the king of the Chaldeans, and killed their young men with the sword in the house of his sanctuary, and did not spare Sedekias, and had no mercy upon their virgins, and they led away their old men: he delivered all things into their hands. 
\v 18 And all the vessels of the house of God, the great and the small, and the treasures of the house of the Lord, and all the treasures of the king and the great men; he brought all to Babylon.
