\mt2 THE WISDOM OF JESUS THE SON OF SIRACH, 
\mt3 OR 
\mt1 ECCLESIASTICUS. 
\is1 The Prologue of the Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach. 
\ip WHEREAS many and great things have been delivered unto us by the law and the prophets, and by the others that have followed in their steps, for the which things we must give Israel the praise of instruction and wisdom; and since not only the readers must needs become skilful themselves, but also they that love learning must be able to profit them which are without, both by speaking and writing; my grandfather Jesus, having much given himself to the reading of the law, and the prophets, and the other books of our fathers, and having gained great familiarity therein, was drawn on also himself to write somewhat pertaining to instruction and wisdom; in order that those who love learning, and are addicted to these things, might make progress much more by living according to the law. Ye are intreated therefore to read with favour and attention, and to pardon us, if in any parts of what we have laboured to interpret, we may seem to fail in some of the phrases. For things originally spoken in Hebrew have not the same force in them, when they are translated into another tongue: and not only these, but the law itself, and the prophecies, and the rest of the books, have no small difference, when they are spoken in their original language. For having come into Egypt in the eight and thirtieth year of Energetes the king, and having continued there some time, I found \f + \fr 1:0  \ft Or, \fqa a like work \ft The word is of very doubtful meaning. \f* a copy affording no small instruction. I thought it therefore most necessary for me to apply some diligence and travail to interpret this book; applying indeed much watchfulness and skill in that space of time to bring the book to an end, and set it forth for them also, who in the land of their sojourning are desirous to learn, fashioning their manners beforehand, so as to live according to the law.

\v 1 All wisdom \add cometh \add* from the Lord, 
\q1 And is with him for ever. 
\q1
\v 2 The sand of the seas, and the drops of rain, 
\q1 And the days of eternity, who shall number? 
\q1
\v 3 The height of the heaven, and the breadth of the earth, 
\q1 And the deep, and wisdom, who shall search \add them \add* out? 
\q1
\v 4 Wisdom hath been created before all things, 
\q1 And the understanding of prudence from everlasting. 
\v 5  \f + \fr 1:5  \ft Verses 5 and 7 are omitted by the best authorities \f* 
\q1
\v 6 To whom hath the root of wisdom been revealed? 
\q1 And who hath known her shrewd counsels? 
\v 7  \f + \fr 1:7  \ft Verses 5 and 7 are omitted by the best authorities \f* 
\q1
\v 8 There is one wise, greatly to be feared, 
\q1 The Lord sitting upon his throne: 
\q1
\v 9 He created her, 
\q1 And saw, and numbered her, 
\q1 And poured her out upon all his works. 
\q1
\v 10  \add She is \add* with all flesh according to his gift; 
\q1 And he gave her freely to them that love him. 
\q1
\v 11 The fear of the Lord is glory, and exultation, 
\q1 And gladness, and a crown of rejoicing. 
\q1
\v 12 The fear of the Lord shall delight the heart, 
\q1 And shall give gladness, and joy, and length of days. 
\q1
\v 13 Whoso feareth the Lord, it shall go well with him at the last, 
\q1 And in the day of his death he shall be blessed. 
\q1
\v 14 To fear the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; 
\q1 And it was created together with the faithful in the womb. 
\q1
\v 15 With men she \f + \fr 1:15  \ft Gr. \fqa nested. \f* laid an eternal foundation; 
\q1 And with their seed shall she be had in trust. 
\q1
\v 16 To fear the Lord is the fulness of wisdom; 
\q1 And she satiateth men with her fruits. 
\q1
\v 17 She shall fill all her house with desirable things, 
\q1 And her garners with her produce. 
\q1
\v 18 The fear of the Lord is the crown of wisdom, 
\q1 Making peace and \f + \fr 1:18  \ft Gr. \fqa health of cure. \f* perfect health to flourish. \f + \fr 1:18  \ft The remainder of this verse is omitted by the best authorities. \f* 
\q1
\v 19 He both saw and numbered her; 
\q1 He rained down skill and knowledge of understanding, 
\q1 And exalted the honour of them that hold her fast. 
\q1
\v 20 To fear the Lord is the root of wisdom; 
\q1 And her branches are length of days. 
\v 21  \f + \fr 1:21  \ft Verse 21 is omitted by the best authorities. \f* 
\b
\q1
\v 22 Unjust wrath can never be justified; 
\q1 For the sway of his wrath is his downfall. 
\q1
\v 23 A man that is longsuffering will \f + \fr 1:23  \ft Most authorities read \fqa resist. \f* bear \f + \fr 1:23  \ft Or, \fqa until \ft his \fqa season \f* for a season, 
\q1 And afterward gladness shall spring up unto him; 
\q1
\v 24 He will hide his words \f + \fr 1:24  \ft Or, \fqa until \ft his \fqa season \f* for a season, 
\q1 And the lips of many shall tell forth his understanding. 
\q1
\v 25 A parable of knowledge is in the treasures of wisdom; 
\q1 But godliness is an abomination to a sinner. 
\q1
\v 26 If thou desire wisdom, keep the commandments, 
\q1 And the Lord shall give her unto thee freely: 
\q1
\v 27 For the fear of the Lord is wisdom and instruction; 
\q1 And \add in \add* faith and meekness is his good pleasure. 
\q1
\v 28 Disobey not the fear of the Lord;\f + \fr 1:28  \ft The remainder of this line is omitted by the best authorities. \f* 
\q1 And come not unto him with a double heart. 
\q1
\v 29 Be not a hypocrite in the mouths of men; 
\q1 And take good heed to thy lips. 
\q1
\v 30 Exalt not thyself, lest thou fall, 
\q1 And bring dishonour upon thy soul; 
\q1 And \add so \add* the Lord shall reveal thy secrets, 
\q1 And shall cast thee down in the midst of the congregation; 
\q1 Because thou camest not unto the fear of the Lord, 
\q1 And thy heart was full of deceit. 
\b
\c  2  
\q1
\v 1 My son, if thou comest to serve the Lord, 
\q1 Prepare thy soul for temptation. 
\q1
\v 2 Set thy heart aright, and constantly endure, 
\q1 And make not haste in time of calamity. 
\q1
\v 3 Cleave unto him, and depart not, 
\q1 That thou mayest be increased at thy latter end. 
\q1
\v 4 Accept whatsoever is brought upon thee, 
\q1 And be longsuffering \f + \fr 2:4  \ft Gr. \fqa in the changes of thy humiliation. \f* when thou passest into humiliation. 
\q1
\v 5 For gold is tried in the fire, 
\q1 And acceptable men in the furnace of humiliation. 
\q1
\v 6 Put thy trust in him, and he will help thee: 
\q1 Order thy ways aright, and set thy hope on him. 
\b
\q1
\v 7 Ye that fear the Lord, wait for his mercy; 
\q1 And turn not aside, lest ye fall. 
\q1
\v 8 Ye that fear the Lord, put your trust in him; 
\q1 And your reward shall not fail. 
\q1
\v 9 Ye that fear the Lord, hope for good things, 
\q1 And for eternal gladness and mercy. 
\q1
\v 10 Look at the generations of old, and see: 
\q1 Who did ever put his trust in the Lord, and was ashamed? 
\q1 Or who did abide in his fear, and was forsaken? 
\q1 Or who did call upon him, and he despised him? 
\q1
\v 11 For the Lord is full of compassion and mercy; 
\q1 And he forgiveth sins, and saveth in time of affliction. 
\b
\q1
\v 12 Woe unto fearful hearts, and to faint hands, 
\q1 And to the sinner that goeth two ways! 
\q1
\v 13 Woe unto the faint heart! for it believeth not; 
\q1 Therefore shall it not be defended. 
\q1
\v 14 Woe unto you that have lost your patience! 
\q1 And what will ye do when the Lord shall visit you? 
\q1
\v 15 They that fear the Lord will not disobey his words; 
\q1 And they that love him will keep his ways. 
\q1
\v 16 They that fear the Lord will seek his good pleasure; 
\q1 And they that love him shall be filled with the law. 
\q1
\v 17 They that fear the Lord will prepare their hearts, 
\q1 And will humble their souls in his sight, 
\q1
\v 18  \add saying, \add* 
\q1 We will fall into the hands of the Lord, 
\q1 And not into the hands of men: 
\q1 For as his majesty is, 
\q1 So also is his mercy. 
\b
\c  3  
\q1
\v 1 Hear me your father, O my children, 
\q1 And do thereafter, that ye may be saved. 
\q1
\v 2 For the Lord hath given the father glory as touching the children, 
\q1 And hath confirmed the judgement of the mother as touching the sons. 
\q1
\v 3 He that honoureth his father shall make atonement for sins: 
\q1
\v 4 And he that giveth glory to his mother is as one that layeth up treasure. 
\q1
\v 5 Whoso honoureth his father shall have joy of his children; 
\q1 And in the day of his prayer he shall be heard. 
\q1
\v 6 He that giveth glory to his father shall have length of days; 
\q1 And he that hearkeneth unto the Lord shall bring rest unto his mother, 
\q1
\v 7  \f + \fr 3:7  \ft The preceding words of this verse are omitted by the best authorities. \f* And will do service under his parents, as unto masters. 
\q1
\v 8 In deed and word honour thy father, 
\q1 That a blessing may come upon thee from him. 
\q1
\v 9 For the blessing of the father establisheth the houses of children; 
\q1 But the curse of the mother rooteth out the foundations. 
\b
\q1
\v 10 Glorify not thyself in the dishonour of thy father; 
\q1 For thy fatherâ€™s dishonour is no glory unto thee. 
\q1
\v 11 For the glory of a man is from the honour of his father; 
\q1 And a mother in dishonour is a reproach to her children. 
\q1
\v 12 My son, help thy father in his old age; 
\q1 And grieve him not as long as he liveth. 
\q1
\v 13 And if he fail in understanding, have patience with him; 
\q1 And dishonour him not \add while thou art \add* in thy full strength. 
\q1
\v 14 For the relieving of thy father shall not be forgotten: 
\q1 And instead of sins it shall be added to build thee up. 
\q1
\v 15 In the day of thine affliction it shall remember thee; 
\q1 As fair weather upon ice, 
\q1 So shall thy sins also melt away. 
\q1
\v 16 He that forsaketh his father is as a blasphemer; 
\q1 And he that provoketh his mother is cursed of the Lord. 
\b
\q1
\v 17 My son, go on with thy business in meekness; 
\q1 So shalt thou be beloved of an acceptable man. 
\q1
\v 18 The greater thou art, humble thyself the more, 
\q1 And thou shalt find favour before the Lord. 
\v 19  \f + \fr 3:19  \ft Verse 19 is omitted by the best authorities.\f* 
\q1
\v 20 For great is the potency of the Lord, 
\q1 And he is glorified of them that are lowly. 
\q1
\v 21 Seek not things that are too hard for thee, 
\q1 And search not out things that are above thy strength. 
\q1
\v 22 The things that have been commanded thee, think thereupon; 
\q1 For thou hast no need of the things that are secret. 
\q1
\v 23 Be not over busy in thy superfluous works: 
\q1 For more things are shewed unto thee than men can understand. 
\q1
\v 24 For the conceit of many hath led them astray; 
\q1 And evil surmising hath caused their judgement to slip. 
\v 25  \f + \fr 3:25  \ft Most authorities omit verse 25, and transpose the lines in verse 26. \f* 
\b
\q1
\v 26 A stubborn heart shall fare ill at the last; 
\q1 And he that loveth danger shall perish therein. 
\q1
\v 27 A stubborn heart shall be laden with troubles; 
\q1 And the sinner shall heap sin upon \f + \fr 3:27  \ft Gr. \fqa sins. \f* sin. 
\q1
\v 28 The calamity of the proud is no healing; 
\q1 For a plant of wickedness hath taken root in him. 
\q1
\v 29 The heart of the prudent will understand a parable; 
\q1 And the ear of a listener is the desire of a wise man. 
\q1
\v 30 Water will quench a flaming fire; 
\q1 And almsgiving will make atonement for sins. 
\q1
\v 31 He that requiteth good turns is mindful of that which cometh afterward; 
\q1 And in the time of his falling he shall find a support. 
\b
\c  4  
\q1
\v 1 My son, deprive not the poor of his living, 
\q1 And make not the needy eyes to wait long. 
\q1
\v 2 Make not a hungry soul sorrowful; 
\q1 Neither provoke a man in his distress. 
\q1
\v 3 To a heart that is provoked add not more trouble; 
\q1 And defer not to give to him that is in need. 
\q1
\v 4 Reject not a suppliant in his affliction; 
\q1 And turn not away thy face from a poor man. 
\q1
\v 5 Turn not away thine eye from one that asketh \add of thee, \add* 
\q1 And give none occasion to a man to curse thee: 
\q1
\v 6 For if he curse thee in the bitterness of his soul, 
\q1 He that made him will hear his supplication. 
\b
\q1
\v 7 Get thyself the love of the congregation; 
\q1 And to a great man bow thy head. 
\q1
\v 8 Incline thine ear to a poor man, 
\q1 And answer him with peaceable words in meekness. 
\q1
\v 9 Deliver him that is wronged from the hand of him that wrongeth him; 
\q1 And be not fainthearted in giving judgement. 
\q1
\v 10 Be as a father unto the fatherless, 
\q1 And instead of a husband unto their mother: 
\q1 So shalt thou be as a son of the Most High, 
\q1 And he shall love thee more than thy mother doth. 
\b
\q1
\v 11 Wisdom exalteth her sons, 
\q1 And taketh hold of them that seek her. 
\q1
\v 12 He that loveth her loveth life; 
\q1 And they that seek to her early shall be filled with gladness. 
\q1
\v 13 He that holdeth her fast shall inherit glory; 
\q1 And where \f + \fr 4:13  \ft Or, \fqa she \f* he entereth, the Lord will bless. 
\q1
\v 14 They that do her service shall minister to the Holy One; 
\q1 And them that love her the Lord doth love. 
\q1
\v 15 He that giveth ear unto her shall judge the nations; 
\q1 And he that giveth heed unto her shall dwell securely. 
\q1
\v 16 If he trust her, he shall inherit her; 
\q1 And his generations shall have her in possession. 
\q1
\v 17 For at the first she will walk with him in crooked ways, 
\q1 And will bring fear and dread upon him, 
\q1 And torment him with her discipline, 
\q1 Until she may trust his soul, and try him by her judgements: 
\q1
\v 18 Then will she return again the straight way unto him, 
\q1 And will gladden him, and reveal to him her secrets. 
\q1
\v 19 If he go astray, she will forsake him, 
\q1 And give him over \f + \fr 4:19  \ft Gr. \fqa to the hands of his fall. \f* to his fall. 
\b
\q1
\v 20 Observe the opportunity, and beware of \f + \fr 4:20  \ft Or, \fqa an evil man \f* evil; 
\q1 And be not ashamed concerning thy soul. 
\q1
\v 21 For there is a shame that bringeth sin; 
\q1 And there is a shame \add that is \add* glory and grace. 
\q1
\v 22 Accept not the person \add of any \add* against thy soul; 
\q1 And \f + \fr 4:22  \ft Or, \fqa be not abashed \f* reverence no man unto thy falling. 
\q1
\v 23 Refrain not speech, \f + \fr 4:23  \ft Gr. \fqa in an occasion of safety. \f* when it tendeth to safety; 
\q1 \f + \fr 4:23  \ft Most authorities omit this line. \f* And hide not thy wisdom for the sake of fair-seeming. 
\q1
\v 24 For by speech wisdom shall be known; 
\q1 And instruction by the word of the tongue. 
\q1
\v 25 Speak not against the truth; 
\q1 And be abashed for thine ignorance. 
\q1
\v 26 Be not ashamed to make confession of thy sins; 
\q1 And force not the current of the river. 
\q1
\v 27 Lay not thyself down for a fool to tread upon; 
\q1 And accept not the person of one that is mighty. 
\q1
\v 28 Strive for the truth unto death, and the Lord God shall fight for thee.

\q1
\v 29 Be not \f + \fr 4:29  \ft Some authorities read \fqa rough. \f* hasty in thy tongue,

\v 31 Let not thine hand be stretched out to receive, and \f + \fr 4:31  \ft Or, \fqa drawn back \f* closed when thou shouldest repay. 
\c 5  
\q1
\v 1 Set not thy heart upon thy goods; 
\q1 And say not, They are sufficient for me. 
\q1
\v 2 Follow not thine own mind and thy strength, 
\q1 To walk in the desires of thy heart; 
\q1
\v 3 And say not, Who shall have dominion over me? 
\q1 For the Lord will surely take vengeance on thee. 
\b
\q1
\v 4 Say not, I sinned, and what happened unto me? 
\q1 For the Lord is longsuffering. \f + \fr 5:4  \ft The remainder of this verse is omitted by the best authorities. \f* 
\q1
\v 5 Concerning atonement, be not without fear, 
\q1 To add sin upon sins: 
\q1
\v 6 And say not, His compassion is great; 
\q1 He will be pacified for the multitude of my sins: 
\q1 For mercy and wrath are with him, 
\q1 And his indignation will rest upon sinners. 
\q1
\v 7 Make no tarrying to turn to the Lord; 
\q1 And put not off from day to day: 
\q1 For suddenly shall the wrath of the Lord come forth; \f + \fr 5:7  \ft A line of this verse is here omitted by the best authorities. \f* 
\q1 And thou shalt perish in the time of vengeance. 
\b
\q1
\v 8 Set not thine heart upon unrighteous gains: 
\q1 For thou shalt profit nothing in the day of calamity. 
\q1
\v 9 Winnow not with every wind, 
\q1 And walk not in every path: 
\q1 Thus doeth the sinner that hath a double tongue. 
\q1
\v 10 Be stedfast in thy understanding; 
\q1 And let thy word be one. 
\b
\q1
\v 11 Be swift to hear; \f + \fr 5:11  \ft The remainder of this line is omitted by the best authorities. \f* 
\q1 And with patience make thine answer. 
\q1
\v 12 If thou hast understanding, answer thy neighbour; 
\q1 And if not, let thy hand be upon thy mouth. 
\q1
\v 13 Glory and dishonour is in talk: 
\q1 And the tongue of a man is his fall. 
\q1
\v 14 Be not called a whisperer; 
\q1 And lie not in wait with thy tongue: 
\q1 For upon the thief there is shame, 
\q1 And an evil condemnation upon him that hath a double tongue. 
\q1
\v 15 In a great matter and in a small, be not ignorant; 
\c 6  
\q1
\v 1 And instead of a friend become not an enemy; 
\q1 For an evil name shall inherit shame and reproach: 
\q1 Even so shall the sinner that hath a double tongue. 
\b
\q1
\v 2 Exalt not thyself in the counsel of thy soul; 
\q1 That thy soul be not torn in pieces as a bull: 
\q1
\v 3 Thou shalt eat up thy leaves, and destroy thy fruits, 
\q1 And leave thyself as a dry tree. 
\q1
\v 4 A wicked soul shall destroy him that hath gotten it, 
\q1 And shall make him \f + \fr 6:4  \ft Or, \fqa a rejoicing \f* a laughingstock to his enemies.

\v 5  \f + \fr 6:5  \ft Gr. \fqa A sweet throat. \f* Sweet words will multiply \f + \fr 6:5  \ft Gr. \fqa his. \f* a manâ€™s friends; 
\q1 And a fair-speaking tongue will multiply courtesies. 
\q1
\v 6 Let those that are at peace with thee be many; 
\q1 But thy counsellors one of a thousand. 
\q1
\v 7 If thou wouldest get thee a friend, get him \f + \fr 6:7  \ft Or, \fqa in the time of trial \f* by proving, 
\q1 And be not in haste to trust him. 
\q1
\v 8 For there is a friend \add that is so \add* for his own occasion; 
\q1 And he will not continue in the day of thy affliction. 
\q1
\v 9 And there is a friend that turneth to enmity; 
\q1 And he will discover strife to thy reproach. 
\q1
\v 10 And there is a friend that is a companion at the table; 
\q1 And he will not continue in the day of thy affliction. 
\q1
\v 11 And in thy prosperity he will be as thyself, 
\q1 And will be bold over thy servants: 
\q1
\v 12 If thou shalt be brought low, he will be against thee, 
\q1 And will hide himself from thy face. 
\q1
\v 13 Separate thyself from thine enemies; 
\q1 And beware of thy friends. 
\b
\q1
\v 14 A faithful friend is a strong \f + \fr 6:14  \ft Or, \fqa covert \f* defence; 
\q1 And he that hath found him hath found a treasure. 
\q1
\v 15 There is nothing that can be taken in exchange for a faithful friend; 
\q1 And his excellency is beyond \f + \fr 6:15  \ft Gr. \fqa weight. \f* price. 
\q1
\v 16 A faithful friend is a medicine of life; 
\q1 And they that fear the Lord shall find him. 
\q1
\v 17 He that feareth the Lord directeth his friendship aright; 
\q1 For as he is, so is his neighbour also. 
\b
\q1
\v 18 My son, gather instruction from thy youth up: 
\q1 And even unto hoar hairs thou shalt find wisdom. 
\q1
\v 19 Come unto her as one that ploweth and soweth, 
\q1 And wait for her good fruits; 
\q1 For thy toil shall be little in the tillage of her, 
\q1 And thou shalt eat of her fruits right soon. 
\q1
\v 20 How exceeding harsh is she to the unlearned! 
\q1 And he that is without understanding will not abide in her. 
\q1
\v 21 As a mighty stone of trial shall she rest upon him; 
\q1 And he will not delay to cast her from him. 
\q1
\v 22 For wisdom is according to her name; and she is not manifest unto many. 
\b
\q1
\v 23 Give ear, my son, and accept my judgement, 
\q1 And refuse not my counsel, 
\q1
\v 24 And bring thy feet into her fetters, 
\q1 And thy neck into her chain. 
\q1
\v 25 Put thy shoulder under her, and bear her, 
\q1 And be not grieved with her bonds. 
\q1
\v 26 Come unto her with all thy soul, 
\q1 And keep her ways with thy whole power. 
\q1
\v 27 Search, and seek, and she shall be made known unto thee; 
\q1 And when thou hast got hold of her, let her not go. 
\q1
\v 28 For at the last thou shalt find her rest; 
\q1 And \f + \fr 6:28  \ft Or, \fqa it \f* she shall be turned for thee into gladness. 
\q1
\v 29 And her fetters shall be to thee for a covering of strength, 
\q1 And her chains for a robe of glory. 
\q1
\v 30 For there is a golden ornament upon her, 
\q1 And her bands are \f + \fr 6:30  \ft Num. xv. 38. \f* a riband of blue. 
\q1
\v 31 Thou shalt put her on \add as \add* a robe of glory, 
\q1 And shalt array thee with her \add as \add* a crown of rejoicing. 
\b
\q1
\v 32 My son, if thou wilt, thou shalt be instructed; 
\q1 And if thou wilt yield thy soul, thou shalt be \f + \fr 6:32  \ft Or, \fqa shrewd \f* prudent. 
\q1
\v 33 If thou love to hear, thou shalt receive; 
\q1 And if thou incline thine ear, thou shalt be wise. 
\q1
\v 34 Stand thou in the multitude of the elders; 
\q1 And whoso is wise, cleave thou unto him. 
\q1
\v 35 Be willing to listen to every godly discourse; 
\q1 And let not the proverbs of understanding escape thee. 
\q1
\v 36 If thou seest a man of understanding, get thee betimes unto him, 
\q1 And let thy foot wear out the steps of his doors. 
\q1
\v 37 Let thy mind dwell upon the ordinances of the Lord, 
\q1 And meditate continually in his commandments: 
\q1 He shall establish thine heart, 
\q1 And thy desire of wisdom shall be given unto thee.

\v 22 When a rich man is fallen, there are many helpers;

\v 9 Praise is not comely in the mouth of a sinner;

\b
\q1
\v 11 Say not thou, It is through the Lord that I fell away;

\v 12 Say not thou, It is he that caused me to err; 
\q1 For he hath no need of a sinful man. 
\q1
\v 13 The Lord hateth every abomination; 
\q1 And they that fear him love it not. 
\q1
\v 14 He himself made man from the beginning, 
\q1 And left him in the hand of his own counsel. 
\q1
\v 15 If thou wilt, thou shalt keep the commandments;

\v 17 Before man is life and death;

\v 7 He was not pacified toward the giants of old time, 
\q1 Who revolted in their strength. 
\q1
\v 8 He spared not those with whom Lot sojourned, 
\q1 Whom he abhorred for their pride. 
\q1
\v 9 He pitied not the people of perdition, 
\q1 Who were taken away in their sins. 
\q1
\v 10 And in like manner the six hundred thousand footmen, 
\q1 Who were gathered together in the hardness of their hearts. 
\q1
\v 11 Even if there be one stiffnecked person, 
\q1 It is marvel if he shall be unpunished: 
\q1 For mercy and wrath are with him; 
\q1 He is mighty to forgive, and he poureth out wrath. 
\q1
\v 12 As his mercy is great, so is his correction also: 
\q1 He judgeth a man according to his works. 
\q1
\v 13 The sinner shall not escape with \add his \add* plunder;

\v 25 There is an exquisite subtilty, and the same is unjust;

\v 26 There is one that doeth wickedly, that hangeth down his head with mourning; 
\q1 But inwardly he is full of deceit, 
\q1
\v 27 Bowing down his face, and making as if he were deaf of one ear: 
\q1 Where he is not known, he will be beforehand with thee. 
\q1
\v 28 And if for want of power he be hindered from sinning, 
\q1 If he find opportunity, he will do mischief. 
\q1
\v 29 A man shall be known by his look,

\v 1 There is a reproof that is not comely; 
\q1 And there is a man that keepeth silence, and he is wise. 
\q1
\v 2 How good is it to reprove, rather than to be wroth; 
\q1 And he that maketh confession shall be kept back from hurt. 
\v 3  \f + \fr 20:3  \ft Verse 3 is omitted by the best authorities. \f* 
\q1
\v 4 As is the lust of an eunuch to deflower a virgin;

\v 5 There is one that keepeth silence, and is found wise; 
\q1 And there is one that is hated for his much talk. 
\q1
\v 6 There is one that keepeth silence, for he hath no answer to make; 
\q1 And there is that keepeth silence, as knowing his time. 
\q1
\v 7 A wise man will be silent till his time come; 
\q1 But the braggart and fool will overpass his time. 
\q1
\v 8 He that useth many words shall be abhorred;

\v 9 There is a prosperity that a man findeth in misfortunes;

\q1
\v 10 There is a gift that shall not profit thee;

\v 11 There is an abasement because of glory;

\v 12 There is that buyeth much for a little,

\v 15 He will give little, and upbraid much;

\q1 To-day he will lend, and to-morrow he will ask it again: 
\q1 Such an one is a hateful man. 
\q1
\v 16 The fool will say, I have no friend,

\v 22 There is that destroyeth his soul through bashfulness;

\v 23 There is that for bashfulness promiseth to his friend;

\b
\q1
\v 24 A lie is a foul blot in a man: 
\q1 It will be continually in the mouth of the ignorant. 
\q1
\v 25 A thief is better than a man that is continually lying: 
\q1 But they both shall inherit destruction. 
\q1
\v 26 The disposition of a liar is dishonour; 
\q1 And his shame is with him continually.

\q1
\v 27 He that is wise in words shall advance himself; 
\q1 And one that is prudent will please great men. 
\q1
\v 28 He that tilleth his land shall raise his heap high; 
\q1 And he that pleaseth great men shall get pardon for iniquity. 
\q1
\v 29 Presents and gifts blind the eyes of the wise,

\v 30 Wisdom that is hid, and treasure that is out of sight,

\q1
\v 3 All iniquity is as a two-edged sword; 
\q1 Its stroke hath no healing. 
\b
\q1
\v 4 Terror and violence will lay waste riches;

\v 5 Supplication from a poor manâ€™s mouth reacheth to the ears of \f + \fr 21:5  \ft Gr. \fqa him. \f* God,

\v 6 One that hateth reproof is in the path of the sinner;

\v 7 He that is mighty in tongue is known afar off:

\v 9 The congregation of wicked men is \add as \add* tow wrapped together;

\v 10 The way of sinners is made smooth with stones; 
\q1 And at the last end thereof is the pit of Hades. 
\b
\q1
\v 11 He that keepeth the law becometh master of the intent thereof; 
\q1 And the end of the fear of the Lord is wisdom. 
\q1
\v 12 He that is not clever will not be instructed; 
\q1 And there is a cleverness which maketh bitterness to abound. 
\q1
\v 13 The knowledge of a wise man shall be made to abound as a flood;

\q1
\v 14 The inward parts of a fool are like a broken vessel; 
\q1 And he will hold no knowledge. 
\b
\q1
\v 15 If a man of knowledge hear a wise word, 
\q1 He will commend it, and add unto it: 
\q1 The dissolute man heareth it, and it displeaseth him, 
\q1 And he putteth it away behind his back. 
\q1
\v 16 The discourse of a fool is like a burden in the way; 
\q1 But grace shall be found on the lips of the wise.

\v 17 The mouth of the prudent man shall be sought for in the congregation;

\v 20 A fool lifteth up his voice with laughter;

\v 13 Accustom not thy mouth to gross rudeness,

\q1
\v 22 So also a wife that leaveth her husband,

\q1
\v 23 For first, she was disobedient in the law of the Most High;

\v 24 She shall be brought out into the congregation;

\v 6 In the waves of the sea, and in all the earth, 
\q1 And in every people and nation, I got a possession. 
\q1
\v 7 With all these I sought rest; 
\q1 And in whose inheritance shall I lodge? 
\q1
\v 8 Then the Creator of all things gave me a commandment; 
\q1 And he that created me made my tabernacle to rest, 
\q1 And said, Let thy tabernacle be in Jacob, 
\q1 And thine inheritance in Israel.

\v 9 He created me from the beginning before the world;

\v 11 In the beloved city likewise he gave me rest;

\q1
\v 12 And I took root in a people that was glorified,

\q1
\v 13 I was exalted like a cedar in Libanus,

\v 17 Be first to leave off for mannersâ€™ sake;

\b
\q1
\v 19 How sufficient to a well-mannered man is a very little, 
\q1 And he doth not breathe hard upon his bed. 
\q1
\v 20 Healthy sleep cometh of moderate eating; 
\q1 He riseth early, and his wits are with him: 
\q1 The pain of wakefulness, and colic,

\v 21 And if thou hast been forced to eat, 
\q1 Rise up in the midst thereof, and thou shalt have rest. 
\q1
\v 22 Hear me, my son, and despise me not,

\v 23 Him that is liberal of his meat the lips shall bless;

\v 25 Shew not thyself valiant in wine;

\v 26 The furnace proveth the temper \add of steel \add* by dipping;

\v 27 Wine is as good as life to men, 
\q1 If thou drink it in its measure: 
\q1 What life is there to a man that is without wine? 
\q1 And it hath been created to make men glad. 
\q1
\v 28 Wine drunk in season \add and \add* to satisfy 
\q1 Is joy of heart, and gladness of soul: 
\q1
\v 29 Wine drunk largely is bitterness of soul, 
\q1 With provocation and conflict. 
\q1
\v 30 Drunkenness increaseth the rage of a fool unto his hurt; 
\q1 It diminisheth strength, and addeth wounds. 
\b
\q1
\v 31 Rebuke not thy neighbour at a banquet of wine, 
\q1 Neither set him at nought in his mirth:

\v 2 And when thou hast done all thy office, take thy place, 
\q1 That thou mayest be gladdened on their account, 
\q1 And receive a crown for thy well ordering.

\q1
\v 8 Sum up thy speech, many things in few words;

\q1
\v 9  \add If thou be \add* among great men, behave not as their equal;

\v 10 Before thunder speedeth lightning;

\q1
\v 11 Rise up betimes, and be not the last;

\q1
\v 12 There take thy pastime, and do what is in thy heart;

\v 13 And for these things bless him that made thee,

\v 15 He that seeketh the law shall be filled therewith: 
\q1 But the hypocrite shall stumble thereat. 
\q1
\v 16 They that fear the Lord shall find judgement, 
\q1 And shall kindle righteous acts as a light. 
\q1
\v 17 A sinful man shunneth reproof, 
\q1 And will find a judgement according to his will. 
\b
\q1
\v 18 A man of counsel will not neglect a thought; 
\q1 A strange and proud man will not crouch in fear, 
\q1 Even after he hath done a thing by himself without counsel. 
\q1
\v 19 Do nothing without counsel; 
\q1 And when thou hast once done, repent not. 
\q1
\v 20 Go not in a way of conflict;

\q1
\v 21 Be not confident in a \f + \fr 32:21  \ft Gr. \fqa without stumbling-blocks.\f* smooth way. 
\q1
\v 22 And beware of thine own children.

\c 33  
\q1
\v 1 There shall no evil happen unto him that feareth the Lord; 
\q1 But in temptation once and again will he deliver him. 
\q1
\v 2 A wise man will not hate the law; 
\q1 But he that is a hypocrite therein is as a ship in a storm. 
\q1
\v 3 A man of understanding will put his trust in the law; 
\q1 And the law is faithful unto him, as when one asketh at the oracle. 
\b
\q1
\v 4 Prepare \add thy \add* speech, and so shalt thou be heard;

\q1
\v 5 The heart of a fool is \add as \add* a cartwheel;

\v 6 A stallion horse is as a mocking friend;

\b
\q1
\v 7 Why doth one day excel another, 
\q1 When all the light of every day in the year is of the sun? 
\q1
\v 8 By the knowledge of the Lord they were distinguished; 
\q1 And he varied seasons and feasts: 
\q1
\v 9 Some of them he exalted and hallowed, 
\q1 And some of them hath he made ordinary days. 
\q1
\v 10 And all men are from the ground, 
\q1 And Adam was created of earth. 
\q1
\v 11 In the abundance of his knowledge the Lord distinguished them, 
\q1 And made their ways various: 
\q1
\v 12 Some of them he blessed and exalted, 
\q1 And some of them he hallowed and brought nigh to himself: 
\q1 Some of them he cursed and brought low, 
\q1 And overthrew them from their place. 
\q1
\v 13 As the clay of the potter in his hand, 
\q1 All his ways are according to his good pleasure; 
\q1 So men are in the hand of him that made them, 
\q1 To render unto them according to his judgement.

\v 14 Good is set over against evil,

\b
\q1
\v 16 And I waked up last, 
\q1 As one that gleaneth after the grape-gatherers: 
\q1 By the blessing of the Lord I got before them, 
\q1 And filled my winepress as one that gathereth grapes. 
\q1
\v 17 Consider that I laboured not for myself alone, 
\q1 But for all them that seek instruction.

\v 18 Hear me, ye great men of the people, 
\q1 And hearken with your ears, ye rulers of the congregation.

\q1
\v 19 To son and wife, to brother and friend, 
\q1 Give not power over thee while thou livest;

\q1
\v 20 Whilst thou yet livest, and breath is in thee, 
\q1 Give not thyself over to anybody.

\v 21 For better it is that thy children should supplicate thee, 
\q1 Than that thou shouldest look to the hand of thy sons. 
\q1
\v 22 In all thy works keep the upper hand; 
\q1 Bring not a stain on thine honour.

\v 23 In the day that thou endest the days of thy life,

\b
\q1
\v 24 Fodder, a stick, and burdens, for an ass; 
\q1 Bread, and discipline, and work, for a servant. 
\q1
\v 25 Set thy servant to work, and thou shalt find rest: 
\q1 Leave his hands idle, and he will seek liberty. 
\q1
\v 26 Yoke and thong will bow the neck: 
\q1 And for an evil servant there are racks and tortures. 
\q1
\v 27 Send him to labour, that he be not idle; 
\q1 For idleness teacheth much mischief. 
\q1
\v 28 Set him to work, as is fit for him; 
\q1 And if he obey not, make his fetters heavy. 
\q1
\v 29 And be not excessive toward any; 
\q1 And without judgement do nothing. 
\b
\q1
\v 30 If thou hast a servant, let him be as thyself, 
\q1 Because thou hast bought him with blood. 
\q1
\v 31 If thou hast a servant, treat him as thyself; 
\q1 \f + \fr 33:31  \ft The Greek text of this line is probably corrupt. \f* For as thine own soul wilt thou have need of him:

\q1 Which way wilt thou go to seek him?

\c  34  
\q1
\v 1 Vain and false hopes are for a man void of understanding; 
\q1 And dreams give wings to fools. 
\q1
\v 2 As one that catcheth at a shadow, and followeth after the wind, 
\q1 So is he that setteth his mind on dreams. 
\q1
\v 3 The vision of dreams is \add as \add* this thing against that, 
\q1 The likeness of a face over against a face. 
\q1
\v 4 Of an unclean thing what shall be cleansed? 
\q1 And of that which is false what shall be true? 
\q1
\v 5 Divinations, and soothsayings, and dreams, are vain: 
\q1 And the heart fancieth, as a womanâ€™s in travail. 
\q1
\v 6 If they be not sent from the Most High in \add thy \add* visitation, 
\q1 Give not thy heart unto them. 
\v 7 For dreams have led many astray:

\v 8 Without lying shall the law be accomplished;

\v 9 A well-instructed man knoweth many things;

\v 11 In my wandering I have seen many things; 
\q1 And more than my words is my understanding. 
\q1
\v 12 Ofttimes was I in danger even unto death; 
\q1 And I was preserved because of these things.

\v 13 The spirit of those that fear the Lord shall live;

\q1
\v 16 The eyes of the Lord are upon them that love him,

\q1 A cover from the hot blast, and a cover from the noonday, 
\q1 A guard from stumbling, and a succour from falling. 
\q1
\v 17 He raiseth up the soul, and enlighteneth the eyes:

\q1
\v 18 He that sacrificeth of a thing wrongfully gotten, his offering is made in mockery;

\v 23 One building, and another pulling down,

\q1
\v 26 Even so a man fasting for his sins,

\v 3 To depart from wickedness is a thing pleasing to the Lord;

\q1
\v 12 Think not to corrupt with gifts; for he will not receive them:

\q1 For the Lord is judge, 
\q1 And with him is no respect of persons. 
\q1
\v 13 He will not accept any person against a poor man; 
\q1 And he will listen to the prayer of him that is wronged.

\v 30 For in multitude of meats there shall be disease,

\v 31 Because of surfeiting have many perished;

\q1
\v 2 For from the Most High cometh healing; 
\q1 And from the king he shall receive a gift. 
\q1
\v 3 The skill of the physician shall lift up his head; 
\q1 And in the sight of great men he shall be admired. 
\q1
\v 4 The Lord created medicines out of the earth; 
\q1 And a prudent man will have no disgust at them. 
\q1
\v 5 Was not water made sweet with wood, 
\q1 That the virtue thereof might be known? 
\q1
\v 6 And he gave men skill, 
\q1 That \f + \fr 38:6  \ft Or, \fqa he \f* they might be glorified in his marvellous works. 
\q1
\v 7 With them doth he heal \add a man, \add* 
\q1 And taketh away his pain. 
\q1
\v 8 With these will the apothecary make a confection; 
\q1 And his works shall not be brought to an end; 
\q1 And from him is peace upon the face of the earth. 
\b
\q1
\v 9 My son, in thy sickness be not negligent; 
\q1 But pray unto the Lord, and he shall heal thee. 
\q1
\v 10 Put away wrong doing, and order thine hands aright, 
\q1 And cleanse thy heart from all manner of sin. 
\q1
\v 11 Give a sweet savour, and a memorial of fine flour; 
\q1 And make fat thine offering, as one that is not. 
\q1
\v 12 Then give place to the physician, for verily the Lord hath created him; 
\q1 And let him not go from thee, for thou hast need of him. 
\q1
\v 13 There is a time when in their very hands is the issue for good. 
\q1
\v 14 For they also shall beseech the Lord, 
\q1 That he may prosper them in \add giving \add* relief and in healing for the maintenance of life. 
\q1
\v 15 He that sinneth before his Maker, 
\q1 Let him fall into the hands of the physician. 
\b
\q1
\v 16 My son, let thy tears fall over the dead, 
\q1 And as one that suffereth grievously begin lamentation; 
\q1 And wind up his body according to his due, 
\q1 And neglect not his burial. 
\q1
\v 17 Make bitter weeping, and make passionate wailing, 
\q1 And let thy mourning be according to his desert, 
\q1 For one day or two, lest thou be evil spoken of: 
\q1 And so be comforted for thy sorrow. 
\q1
\v 18 For of sorrow cometh death, 
\q1 And sorrow of heart will bow down the strength. 
\q1
\v 19 In calamity sorrow also remaineth: 
\q1 And the poor manâ€™s life is \f + \fr 38:19  \ft Gr. \fqa against the heart. \f* grievous to the heart. 
\q1
\v 20 Give not thy heart unto sorrow: 
\q1 Put it away, remembering the last end: 
\q1
\v 21 Forget it not, for there is no returning again: 
\q1 Him thou shalt not profit, and thou wilt hurt thyself. 
\q1
\v 22 Remember the sentence upon him; for so also shall thine be; 
\q1 Yesterday for me, and today for thee. 
\q1
\v 23 When the dead is at rest, let his remembrance rest; 
\q1 And be comforted for him, when his spirit departeth from him. 
\b
\q1
\v 24 The wisdom of the scribe cometh by opportunity of leisure; 
\q1 And \f + \fr 38:24  \ft Gr. \fqa he that is lessened in his business. \f* he that hath little business shall become wise. 
\q1
\v 25 How shall he become wise that holdeth the plough, 
\q1 That glorieth in the shaft of the goad, 
\q1 That driveth oxen, and is occupied in their labours, 
\q1 And whose discourse is of the stock of bulls? 
\q1
\v 26 He will set his heart upon turning his furrows; 
\q1 And his wakefulness is to give his heifers their fodder. 
\q1
\v 27 So is every artificer and workmaster, 
\q1 That passeth his time by night as by day; 
\q1 They that cut gravings of signets, 
\q1 And his diligence is to make great variety; 
\q1 He will set his heart to preserve likeness in his portraiture, 
\q1 And will be wakeful to finish his work. 
\q1
\v 28 So is the smith sitting by the anvil, 
\q1 And considering the unwrought iron: 
\q1 The vapour of the fire will waste his flesh; 
\q1 And in the heat of the furnace will he wrestle \add with his work: \add* 
\q1 The noise of the hammer will \f + \fr 38:28  \ft Gr. \fqa renew. \f* be ever in his ear, 
\q1 And his eyes are upon the pattern of the vessel; 
\q1 He will set his heart upon perfecting his works, 
\q1 And he will be wakeful to adorn them perfectly. 
\q1
\v 29 So is the potter sitting at his work, 
\q1 And turning the wheel about with his feet, 
\q1 Who is alway anxiously set at his work, 
\q1 And all his handywork is by number; 
\q1
\v 30 He will fashion the clay with his arm, 
\q1 And will bend its strength in front of his feet; 
\q1 He will apply his heart to finish the glazing; 
\q1 And he will be wakeful to make clean the furnace. 
\b
\q1
\v 31 All these put their trust in their hands; 
\q1 And each becometh wise in his own work.

\v 34 But they will maintain the fabric of the \f + \fr 38:34  \ft Gr. \fqa age. \f* world;

\q1 And will be occupied in prophecies. 
\q1
\v 2 He will keep the discourse of the men of renown, 
\q1 And will enter in amidst the subtilties of parables. 
\q1
\v 3 He will seek out the hidden meaning of proverbs, 
\q1 And be conversant in the dark sayings of parables. 
\q1
\v 4 He will serve among great men, 
\q1 And appear before him that ruleth: 
\q1 He will travel through the land of strange nations; 
\q1 For he hath tried good things and evil among men. 
\q1
\v 5 He will apply his heart to resort early to the Lord that made him, 
\q1 And will make supplication before the Most High, 
\q1 And will open his mouth in prayer, 
\q1 And will make supplication for his sins. 
\b
\q1
\v 6 If the great Lord will, 
\q1 He shall be filled with the spirit of understanding: 
\q1 He shall pour forth the words of his wisdom, 
\q1 And in prayer give thanks unto the Lord. 
\q1
\v 7 He shall direct his counsel and knowledge, 
\q1 And in his secrets shall he meditate.

\v 8 He shall shew forth the instruction which he hath been taught, 
\q1 And shall glory in the law of the covenant of the Lord. 
\q1
\v 9 Many shall commend his understanding;

\q1 His memorial shall not depart, 
\q1 And his name shall live from generation to generation. 
\q1
\v 10 Nations shall declare his wisdom, 
\q1 And the congregation shall tell out his praise. 
\q1
\v 11 If he continue, he shall leave a greater name than a thousand: 
\q1 And if he \f + \fr 39:11  \ft Gr. \fqa cease. \f* die, he addeth thereto. 
\b
\q1
\v 12 Yet more will I utter, which I have thought upon; 
\q1 And I am filled as the moon at the full. 
\q1
\v 13 Hearken unto me, ye holy children, 
\q1 And bud forth as a rose growing by a brook of water: 
\q1
\v 14 And give ye a sweet savour as frankencense, 
\q1 And put forth flowers as a lily, 
\q1 Spread abroad a sweet smell, and sing a song of praise; 
\q1 Bless ye the Lord for all his works. 
\q1
\v 15 Magnify his name, 
\q1 And give utterance to his praise 
\q1 With the songs of your lips, and with harps;

\q1
\v 18 At his command is all his good pleasure \add done; \add* 
\q1 And there is none that shall hinder his salvation. 
\q1
\v 19 The works of all flesh are before him;

\v 20 He beholdeth from everlasting to everlasting; 
\q1 And there is nothing wonderful before him. 
\q1
\v 21 None can say, What is this? wherefore is that?

\q1
\v 22 His blessing covered the dry land as a river,

\v 23 As he hath turned the waters into saltness;

\v 28 There be winds that are created for vengeance,

\v 5 Great is the Lord that made him;

\q1
\v 6 The moon also is in all things for her season,

\q1
\v 7 From the moon is the sign of the feast day; 
\q1 A light that waneth when she is come to the full. 
\q1
\v 8 The month is called after her name, 
\q1 Increasing wonderfully in her changing; 
\q1 An instrument of the hosts on high, 
\q1 Shining forth in the firmament of heaven; 
\q1
\v 9 The beauty of heaven, the glory of the stars, 
\q1 An ornament giving light in the highest places of the Lord. 
\q1
\v 10 At the word of the Holy One they will stand in \f + \fr 43:10  \ft Gr. \fqa judgement. \f* due order,

\v 11 Look upon the rainbow, and praise him that made it;

\q1
\v 12 It compasseth the heaven round about with a circle of glory; 
\q1 The hands of the Most High have stretched it. 
\b
\q1
\v 13 By his commandment he maketh the snow to fall apace, 
\q1 And sendeth swiftly the lightnings of his judgement. 
\q1
\v 14 By reason thereof the treasure-houses are opened; 
\q1 And clouds fly forth as fowls. 
\q1
\v 15 By his mighty power he maketh strong the clouds, 
\q1 And the hailstones are broken small: 
\q1
\v 16 And at his appearing the mountains will be shaken, 
\q1 And at his will the south wind will blow. 
\q1
\v 17 The voice of his thunder maketh the earth to travail; 
\q1 So doth the northern storm and the whirlwind: 
\q1 As birds flying down he sprinkleth the snow; 
\q1 And as the lighting of the locust is the falling down thereof: 
\q1
\v 18 The eye will marvel at the beauty of its whiteness, 
\q1 And the heart will be astonished at the raining of it. 
\q1
\v 19 The hoar frost also he poureth on the earth as salt; 
\q1 And when it is congealed, it is \add as \add* points of thorns. 
\b
\q1
\v 20 The cold north wind shall blow, 
\q1 And the ice shall be congealed on the water: 
\q1 It shall lodge upon every gathering together of water, 
\q1 And the water shall put on as it were a breastplate. 
\q1
\v 21 It shall devour the mountains, and burn up the wilderness, 
\q1 And consume the green herb as fire. 
\q1
\v 22 A mist coming speedily is the healing of all things;

\v 23 By his counsel he hath stilled the deep,

\v 27 We may say many things, yet shall we not attain;

\v 28 How shall we have strength to glorify him? 
\q1 For he is himself the great one above all his works. 
\q1
\v 29 The Lord is terrible and exceeding great; 
\q1 And marvellous is his power. 
\q1
\v 30 When ye glorify the Lord, exalt him as much as ye can;

\v 31 Who hath seen him, that he may declare him?

\v 32 Many things are hidden greater than these;

\v 16 Enoch pleased the Lord, and was translated,

\q1
\v 17 Noah was found perfect \add and \add* righteous;

\v 18 Everlasting covenants were made with him,

\v 19 Abraham was a great father of a multitude of nations; 
\q1 And there was none found like him in glory; 
\q1
\v 20 Who kept the law of the Most High, 
\q1 And was taken into covenant with him: 
\q1 In his flesh he established the covenant; 
\q1 And when he was proved, he was found faithful. 
\b
\q1
\v 21 Therefore he assured him by an oath, 
\q1 That the nations should be blessed in his seed; 
\q1 That he would multiply him as the dust of the earth, 
\q1 And exalt his seed as the stars, 
\q1 And cause them to inherit from sea to sea, 
\q1 And from the River unto the utmost part of the earth. 
\q1
\v 22 In Isaac also did he establish likewise, for Abraham his fatherâ€™s sake, 
\q1 The blessing of all men, and the covenant: 
\q1
\v 23 And he made it rest upon the head of Jacob; 
\q1 He acknowledged him in his blessings, 
\q1 And gave to him by inheritance, 
\q1 And divided his portions; 
\q1 Among twelve tribes did he part them. 
\b
\c  45  
\q1
\v 1 And he brought out of him a man of mercy, 
\q1 Which found favour in the sight of all flesh; 
\q1 A man beloved of God and men, even Moses, 
\q1 Whose memorial is blessed. 
\q1
\v 2 He made him like to the glory of the saints,

\q1
\v 3 By his words he caused the wonders to cease;

\q1
\v 6 He exalted Aaron, a holy man like unto him,

\v 15 Moses \f + \fr 45:15  \ft Gr. \fqa filled his hands. \f* consecrated him,

\q1 To minister unto him, and to execute also the priestâ€™s office, 
\q1 And bless his people in his name. 
\q1
\v 16 He chose him out of all living 
\q1 To offer sacrifice to the Lord, 
\q1 Incense, and a sweet savour, for a memorial, 
\q1 To make reconciliation for thy people. 
\q1
\v 17 He gave unto him in his commandments,

\q1 To teach Jacob the testimonies, 
\q1 And to enlighten Israel in his law. 
\q1
\v 18 Strangers gathered themselves together against him,

\q1 \add Even \add* Dathan and Abiram with their company, 
\q1 And the congregation of Korah, with wrath and anger. 
\q1
\v 19 The Lord saw it, and it displeased him; 
\q1 And in the wrath of his anger they were destroyed: 
\q1 He did wonders upon them, 
\q1 To consume them with flaming fire. 
\q1
\v 20 And he added glory to Aaron, 
\q1 And gave him a heritage: 
\q1 He divided unto him the firstfruits of the increase; 
\q1 \add And \add* first did he prepare bread in abundance: 
\q1
\v 21 For they shall eat the sacrifices of the Lord, 
\q1 Which he gave unto him and to his seed. 
\q1
\v 22 Howbeit in the land of the people he shall have no inheritance,

\v 23 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar is the third in glory,

\q1 And he made reconciliation for Israel. 
\q1
\v 24 Therefore was there a covenant of peace established for him,

\v 25 Also \add he made \add* a covenant with David the son of Jesse, of the tribe of Judah;

\v 2 How was he glorified in the lifting up his hands,

\q1
\v 3 Who before him so stood fast? 
\q1 For the Lord himself brought his enemies unto him. 
\q1
\v 4 Did not the sun go back by his hand? 
\q1 And did not one day become as two? 
\q1
\v 5 He called upon the Most High \add and \add* Mighty One, 
\q1 When his foes pressed him round about; 
\q1 And the great Lord heard him. 
\q1
\v 6 With hailstones of mighty power 
\q1 He caused war to break violently upon the nation, 
\q1 And \f + \fr 46:6  \ft See Joshua x. 11 \f* in the going down he destroyed them that resisted; 
\q1 That the nations might know his \f + \fr 46:6  \ft Gr. \fqa panoply. \f* armour, 
\q1 How that he fought in the sight of the Lord; 
\q1 For he followed after the Mighty One. 
\q1
\v 7 Also in the time of Moses he did a work of mercy, 
\q1 He and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, 
\q1 In that they withstood the adversary, 
\q1 Hindered the people from sin, 
\q1 And stilled the murmuring of wickedness. 
\q1
\v 8 And of six hundred thousand people on foot, they two alone were preserved 
\q1 To bring them into the heritage, 
\q1 Even into a land flowing with milk and honey. 
\q1
\v 9 Also the Lord gave strength unto Caleb, 
\q1 And it remained with him unto his old age; 
\q1 So that he entered upon the height of the land, 
\q1 And his seed obtained it for a heritage: 
\q1
\v 10 That all the children of Israel might see 
\q1 That it is good to walk after the Lord.

\q1
\v 11 Also the judges, every one by his name,

\q1
\v 13 Samuel, the prophet of the Lord, beloved of his Lord, 
\q1 Established a kingdom, and anointed princes over his people. 
\q1
\v 14 By the law of the Lord he judged the congregation, 
\q1 And the Lord visited Jacob. 
\q1
\v 15 By his faithfulness he was proved to be a prophet, 
\q1 And by his words he was known to be faithful in vision. 
\q1
\v 16 Also when his enemies pressed him round about 
\q1 He called upon the Lord, the Mighty One, 
\q1 With the offering of the sucking lamb. 
\q1
\v 17 And the Lord thundered from heaven, 
\q1 And with a mighty sound made his voice to be heard. 
\q1
\v 18 And he utterly destroyed the rulers of the Tyrians, 
\q1 And all the princes of the Philistines. 
\q1
\v 19 Also before the time of his \f + \fr 46:19  \ft Gr. \fqa age-long sleep. \f* long sleep 
\q1 He made protestations in the sight of the lord and \add his \add* anointed, 
\q1 I have not taken any manâ€™s goods, so much as a shoe: 
\q1 And no man did accuse him. 
\q1
\v 20 And after he fell asleep he prophesied, 
\q1 And shewed the king his end, 
\q1 And lifted up his voice from the earth in prophecy, 
\q1 To blot out the wickedness of the people. 
\b
\c  47  
\q1
\v 1 And after him rose up Nathan 
\q1 To prophesy in the days of David. 
\q1
\v 2 As is the fat when it is separated from the peace offering, 
\q1 So was David \add separated \add* from the children of Israel. 
\q1
\v 3 He played with lions as with kids, 
\q1 And with bears as with lambs of the flock. 
\q1
\v 4 In his youth did he not slay a giant, 
\q1 And take away reproach from the people, 
\q1 When he lifted up his hand with a sling stone, 
\q1 And beat down the boasting of Goliath? 
\q1
\v 5 For he called upon the Most High Lord; 
\q1 And he gave him strength in his right hand, 
\q1 To slay a man mighty in war, 
\q1 To exalt the horn of his people. 
\q1
\v 6 So they glorified him for \add his \add* ten thousands, 
\q1 And praised him for the blessings of the Lord, 
\q1 In that there was given him a diadem of glory. 
\q1
\v 7 For he destroyed the enemies on every side, 
\q1 And brought to nought the Philistines his adversaries, 
\q1 Brake their horn in pieces unto this day. 
\q1
\v 8 In every work of his he gave thanks to the Holy One Most High with words of glory; 
\q1 With his whole heart he sang praise, 
\q1 And loved him that made him. 
\q1
\v 9 Also he set singers before the altar, 
\q1 And to make sweet melody by their music. \f + \fr 47:9  \ft The remainder of this verse is omitted by the best authorities. \f* 
\q1
\v 10 He gave comeliness to the feasts, 
\q1 And set in order the seasons to perfection, 
\q1 While they praised his holy name, 
\q1 And the sanctuary sounded from early morning. 
\q1
\v 11 The Lord took away his sins, 
\q1 And exalted his horn for ever; 
\q1 And gave him a covenant of kings, 
\q1 And a throne of glory in Israel. 
\q1
\v 12 After him rose up a son, a man of understanding; 
\q1 And for his sake he dwelt at large. 
\q1
\v 13 Solomon reigned in days of peace; 
\q1 And to him God gave rest round about, 
\q1 That he might set up a house for his name, 
\q1 And prepare a sanctuary for ever. 
\q1
\v 14 How wise wast thou made in thy youth, 
\q1 And filled as a river with understanding! 
\q1
\v 15 Thy soul covered the earth, 
\q1 And thou filledst it with \f + \fr 47:15  \ft Gr. \fqa parables of riddles. \f* dark parables. 
\q1
\v 16 Thy name reached unto the isles afar off; 
\q1 And for thy peace thou wast beloved. 
\q1
\v 17 For thy songs and proverbs and parables, 
\q1 And for thine interpretations, the countries marvelled at thee. 
\q1
\v 18 By the name of the Lord God, 
\q1 Which is called the God of Israel, 
\q1 Thou didst gather gold as tin, 
\q1 And didst multiply silver as lead. 
\q1
\v 19 Thou didst bow thy loins unto women, 
\q1 And in thy body thou wast brought into subjection. 
\q1
\v 20 Thou didst blemish thine honour, 
\q1 And profane thy seed, 
\q1 To bring wrath upon thy children; 
\q1 And I was grieved for thy folly: 
\q1
\v 21 So that the sovereignty was divided, 
\q1 And out of Ephraim ruled a disobedient kingdom. 
\q1
\v 22 But the Lord will never forsake his mercy; 
\q1 And he will not destroy any of his works, 
\q1 Nor blot out the posterity of his elect; 
\q1 And the seed of him that loved him he will not take away; 
\q1 And he gave a remnant unto Jacob, 
\q1 And unto David a root out of him. 
\b
\q1
\v 23 And \add so \add* rested Solomon with his fathers; 
\q1 And of his seed he left behind him Rehoboam, 
\q1 \add Even \add* the foolishness of the people, and one that lacked understanding, 
\q1 Who made the people to revolt by his counsel. 
\q1 Also Jeroboam the son of Nebat, 
\q1 Who made Israel to sin, 
\q1 And gave unto Ephraim a way of sin. 
\q1
\v 24 And their sins were multiplied exceedingly, 
\q1 To remove them from their land. 
\q1
\v 25 For they sought out all manner of wickedness, 
\q1 Till vengeance should come upon them. 
\b
\c  48  
\q1
\v 1 Also there arose Elijah the prophet as fire, 
\q1 And his word burned like a torch: 
\q1
\v 2 Who brought a famine upon them, 
\q1 And by his zeal made them few in number. 
\q1
\v 3 By the word of the Lord he shut up the heaven: 
\q1 Thrice did he thus bring down fire. 
\q1
\v 4 How wast thou glorified, O Elijah, in thy wondrous deeds! 
\q1 And who shall glory like unto thee? 
\q1
\v 5 Who did raise up a dead man from death, 
\q1 And from \f + \fr 48:5  \ft Gr. \fqa Hades. \f* the place of the dead, by the word of the Most High:

\v 6 Who brought down kings to destruction,

\q1
\v 7 Who heard rebuke in Sinai, 
\q1 And judgements of vengeance in Horeb: 
\q1
\v 8 Who anointed kings for retribution, 
\q1 And prophets to succeed after him: 
\q1
\v 9 Who was taken up in a tempest of fire, 
\q1 In a chariot of fiery horses: 
\q1
\v 10 Who was recorded for reproofs in their seasons, 
\q1 To pacify anger, before it brake forth into wrath; 
\q1 To turn the heart of the father unto the son, 
\q1 And to restore the tribes of Jacob. 
\q1
\v 11 Blessed are they that saw thee, 
\q1 And they that have been beautified with love; 
\q1 For we also shall surely live.

\q1
\v 12 Elijah \add it was, \add* who was wrapped in a tempest:

\q1
\v 14 As in his life he did wonders, 
\q1 So in death were his works marvellous. 
\q1
\v 15 For all this the people repented not, 
\q1 And they departed not from their sins, 
\q1 Till they were carried away as a spoil from their land, 
\q1 And were scattered through all the earth; 
\q1 And the people was left very few in number, 
\q1 And a ruler \add was left \add* in the house of David. 
\q1
\v 16 Some of them did that which was pleasing \add to God, \add* 
\q1 And some multiplied sins.

\v 19 Then were their hearts and their hands shaken, 
\q1 And they were in pain, as women in travail; 
\q1
\v 20 And they called upon the Lord which is merciful, 
\q1 Spreading forth their hands unto him: 
\q1 And the Holy One heard them speedily out of Heaven, 
\q1 And delivered them by the hand of Isaiah. 
\q1
\v 21 He smote the camp of the Assyrians, 
\q1 And his angel utterly destroyed them. 
\q1
\v 22 For Hezekiah did that which was pleasing to the Lord, 
\q1 And was strong in the ways of David his father, 
\q1 Which Isaiah the prophet commanded, 
\q1 Who was great and faithful in his vision. 
\q1
\v 23 In his days the sun went backward; 
\q1 And he added life to the king. 
\q1
\v 24 He saw by an excellent spirit what should come to pass at the last; 
\q1 And he comforted them that mourned in Sion. 
\q1
\v 25 He shewed the things that should be to the end of time, 
\q1 And the hidden things or ever they came.

\v 1 The memorial of Josiah is like the composition of incense 
\q1 Prepared by the work of the apothecary: 
\q1 It shall be sweet as honey in every mouth, 
\q1 And as music at a banquet of wine. 
\q1
\v 2 He behaved himself uprightly in the conversion of the people, 
\q1 And took away the abominations of iniquity. 
\q1
\v 3 He set his heart right toward the Lord; 
\q1 In the days of wicked men he made godliness to prevail. 
\b
\q1
\v 4 Except David and Hezekiah and Josiah, 
\q1 All committed trespass: 
\q1 For they forsook the law of the Most High; 
\q1 The kings of Judah failed. 
\q1
\v 5 For they gave their \f + \fr 49:5  \ft Gr. \fqa horn. \f* power unto others, 
\q1 And their glory to a strange nation. 
\q1
\v 6 They set on fire the chosen city of the sanctuary, 
\q1 And made her streets desolate, \add as it was written \add* by the hand of Jeremiah. 
\q1
\v 7 For they entreated him evil; 
\q1 And yet he was sanctified in the womb to be a prophet, 
\q1 To root out, and to afflict, and to destroy; 
\q1 \add And \add* in like manner to build and to plant. 
\q1
\v 8  \add It was \add* Ezekiel who saw the vision of glory, 
\q1 Which \add God \add* shewed him upon the chariot of the cherubim. 
\q1
\v 9 For verily he remembered the enemies in \f + \fr 49:9  \ft Gr. \fqa rain. \f* storm, 
\q1 And to do good to them that directed their ways aright. 
\q1
\v 10 Also of the twelve prophets \f + \fr 49:10  \ft The remainder of this line is omitted by the best authorities. \f* 
\q1 May the bones flourish again out of their place.

\q1
\v 11 How shall we magnify Zerubbabel? 
\q1 And he was as a signet on the right hand: 
\q1
\v 12 So was Jesus the son of Josedek: 
\q1 Who in their days builded the house, 
\q1 And exalted a \f + \fr 49:12  \ft Some ancient authorities read \fqa temple. \f* people holy to the Lord, 
\q1 Prepared for everlasting glory. 
\q1
\v 13 Also of Nehemiah the memorial is great; 
\q1 Who raised up for us the walls that were fallen, 
\q1 And set up the gates and bars, 
\q1 And raised up our homes again.

\q1
\v 14 No man was created upon the earth such as was Enoch; 
\q1 For he was taken up from the earth. 
\q1
\v 15 Neither was there a man born like unto Joseph, 
\q1 A governor of his brethren, a stay of the people: 
\q1 Yea, his bones were visited. 
\q1
\v 16 Shem and Seth were glorified among men; 
\q1 And above every living thing in the creation is Adam.

\v 2 And by him was built from the foundation the height of the double \add wall, \add* 
\q1 The lofty underworks of the inclosure of the temple: 
\q1
\v 3 In his days the cistern of waters was \f + \fr 50:3  \ft The text here seems to be corrupt. \f* diminished, 
\q1 The brazen vessel in compass as the sea. 
\q1
\v 4  \add It was \add* he that took thought for his people that they should not fall, 
\q1 And fortified the city \f + \fr 50:4  \ft Gr. \fqa to beseige: \ft that is, \fqa as to besieging it. \f* against besieging: 
\q1
\v 5 How glorious was he when the people gathered round him 
\q1 At his coming forth out of the \f + \fr 50:5  \ft Gr. \fqa house of the veil. \f* sanctuary! 
\q1
\v 6 As the morning star in the midst of a cloud, 
\q1 As the moon at the full: 
\q1
\v 7 As the sun shining forth upon the temple of the Most High, 
\q1 And as the rainbow giving light in clouds of glory: 
\q1
\v 8 As the flower of roses in the days of new \add fruits, \add* 
\q1 As lilies at the waterspring, 
\q1 As the shoot of the frankencense tree in the time of summer: 
\q1
\v 9 As fire and incense in the censer, 
\q1 As a vessel all of beaten gold 
\q1 Adorned with all manner of precious stones: 
\q1
\v 10 As an olive tree budding forth fruits, 
\q1 And as a cypress growing high among the clouds. 
\q1
\v 11 When he took up the robe of glory, 
\q1 And put on the perfection of exultation, 
\q1 In the ascent of the holy altar, 
\q1 He made glorious the precinct of the sanctuary. 
\q1
\v 12 And when he received the portions out of the priestsâ€™ hands, 
\q1 Himself also standing by the hearth of the altar, 
\q1 His brethren as a garland round about him, 
\q1 He was as a young cedar in Libanus; 
\q1 And as stems of palm trees compassed they him round about, 
\q1
\v 13 And all the sons of Aaron in their glory, 
\q1 And the Lordâ€™s offering in their hands, before all the congregation of Israel. 
\q1
\v 14 And finishing the service at the altars, 
\q1 That he might adorn the offering of the Most High, the Almighty, 
\q1
\v 15 He stretched out his hand to the \f + \fr 50:15  \ft Gr. \fqa cup of libation. \f* cup, 
\q1 And poured out the cup of the grape; 
\q1 He poured out at the foot of the altar 
\q1 A sweet-smelling savour unto the Most High, the King of all. 
\q1
\v 16 Then shouted the sons of Aaron, 
\q1 They sounded the trumpets of beaten work, 
\q1 They made a great noise to be heard, 
\q1 For a remembrance before the Most High. 
\q1
\v 17 Then all the people together hasted, 
\q1 And fell down upon the earth on their faces 
\q1 To worship their Lord, the Almighty, God Most High. 
\q1
\v 18 The singers also praised him with their voices; 
\q1 In the whole house was there made sweet melody. 
\q1
\v 19 And the people besought the Lord Most High, 
\q1 In prayer before him that is merciful. 
\q1 Till the \f + \fr 50:19  \ft Gr. \fqa adornment. \f* worship of the Lord should be ended; 
\q1 And so they accomplished his service. 
\q1
\v 20 Then he went down, and lifted up his hands 
\q1 Over the whole congregation of the children of Israel, 
\q1 To give blessing unto the Lord with his lips, 
\q1 And to glory in his name. 
\q1
\v 21 And he bowed himself down in worship the second time, 
\q1 To declare the blessing from the Most High. 
\b
\q1
\v 22 And now bless ye the God of all, 
\q1 Which everywhere doeth great things, 
\q1 Which exalteth our days from the womb, 
\q1 And dealeth with us according to his mercy.

\v 23 May he grant us joyfulness of heart, 
\q1 And that peace may be in our days in Israel for the days of eternity:

\p A Prayer of Jesus the son of Sirach. 
\q1
\v 1 I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, O King, 
\q1 And will praise thee, O God my Saviour: 
\q1 I do give thanks unto thy name: 
\q1
\v 2 For thou wast my protector and helper, 
\q1 And didst deliver my body out of destruction, 
\q1 And out of the snare of a slanderous tongue, 
\q1 From lips that forge lies, 
\q1 And wast my helper before them that stood by; 
\q1
\v 3 And didst deliver me, according to the abundance of thy mercy, and \add greatness \add* of thy name, 
\q1 From the gnashings \add of teeth \add* ready to devour, 
\q1 Out of the hand of such as sought my life, 
\q1 Out of the manifold afflictions which I had; 
\q1
\v 4 From the choking of a fire on every side, 
\q1 And out of the midst of fire which I kindled not; 
\q1
\v 5 Out of the depth of the belly of \f + \fr 51:5  \ft Gr. \fqa Hades. \f* the grave, 
\q1 And from an unclean tongue, 
\q1 And from lying words, 
\q1
\v 6 The slander of an unrighteous tongue unto the king. 
\q1 My soul drew near even unto death, 
\q1 And my life was near to \f + \fr 51:6  \ft Gr. \fqa Hades \f* the grave beneath. 
\q1
\v 7 They compassed me on every side, 
\q1 And there was none to help \add me. \add* 
\q1 \add I was \add* looking for the succour of men, 
\q1 And it was not. 
\q1
\v 8 And I remembered thy mercy, O Lord, 
\q1 And thy working which hath been from everlasting, 
\q1 How thou deliverest them that wait for thee, 
\q1 And savest them out of the hand of the enemies. 
\q1
\v 9 And I lifted up my supplication from the earth, 
\q1 And prayed for deliverance from death. 
\q1
\v 10 I called upon the Lord, the Father of my Lord, 
\q1 That he would not forsake me in the days of affliction, 
\q1 In the time when there was no help against the proud. 
\q1
\v 11 I will praise thy name continually, 
\q1 And will sing praise with thanksgiving; 
\q1 And my supplication was heard: 
\q1
\v 12 For thou savedst me from destruction, 
\q1 And deliveredst me from the evil time: 
\q1 Therefore will I give thanks and praise unto thee, 
\q1 And bless the name of the Lord. 
\b
\q1
\v 13 When I was yet young, 
\q1 Or ever I went abroad, 
\q1 I sought wisdom openly in my prayer. 
\q1
\v 14 Before the temple I asked for her, 
\q1 And I will seek her out even to the end. 
\q1
\v 15 From \add her \add* flower as from the ripening grape my heart delighted in her: 
\q1 My foot trod in uprightness, 
\q1 From my youth I tracked her out. 
\q1
\v 16 I bowed down mine ear a little, and received her, 
\q1 And found for myself much instruction. 
\q1
\v 17 I profited in her: 
\q1 Unto him that giveth me wisdom I will give glory. 
\q1
\v 18 For I purposed to practice her, 
\q1 And I was zealous for that which is good; 
\q1 And I shall never be put to shame. 
\q1
\v 19 My soul hath wrestled in her, 
\q1 And in my doing I was exact: 
\q1 I spread forth my hands to the heaven above, 
\q1 And bewailed my ignorances of her. 
\q1
\v 20 I set my soul aright unto her, 
\q1 And in pureness I found her. 
\q1 I gat me a heart \add joined \add* with her from the beginning: 
\q1 Therefore shall I not be forsaken. 
\q1
\v 21 My inward part also was troubled to seek her: 
\q1 Therefore have I gotten a good possession. 
\q1
\v 22 The Lord gave me a tongue for my reward; 
\q1 And I will praise him therewith. 
\b
\q1
\v 23 Draw near unto me, ye unlearned, 
\q1 And lodge in the house of instruction. 
\q1
\v 24 Say, wherefore are ye lacking in these things, 
\q1 And your souls are very thirsty? 
\q1
\v 25 I opened my mouth, and spake, 
\q1 Get her for yourselves without money. 
\q1
\v 26 Put your neck under the yoke, 
\q1 And let your soul receive instruction: 
\q1 She is hard at hand to find. 
\q1
\v 27 Behold with your eyes, 
\q1 How that I laboured but a little, 
\q1 And found for myself much rest. 
\q1
\v 28 Get you instruction with a great sum of silver, 
\q1 And gain much gold by her. 
\q1
\v 29 May your soul rejoice in his mercy, 
\q1 And may ye not be put to shame in praising him. 
\q1
\v 30 Work your work before the time cometh, 
\q1 And in his time he will give you your reward.
