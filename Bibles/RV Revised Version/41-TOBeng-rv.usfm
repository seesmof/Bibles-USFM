\p
\v 1 THE book of the words of Tobit, the son of Tobiel, the son of Ananiel, the son of Aduel, the son of Gabael, of the seed of Asiel, of the tribe of Naphtali; 
\v 2 who in the days of \f + \fr 1:2  \ft That is, \fqa Shalmaneser. \ft Compare 2 Kings xvii. 3, 23. \f* Enemessar king of the Assyrians was carried away captive out of Thisbe, which is on the right hand of Kedesh Naphtali in Galilee above Asher. 
\p
\v 3 I Tobit walked in the ways of truth and righteousness all the days of my life, and I did many almsdeeds to my brethren and my nation, who went with me into the land of the Assyrians, to Nineveh. 
\v 4 And when I was in mine own country, in the land of Israel, while I was yet young, all the tribe of Naphtali my father fell away from the house of Jerusalem, which was chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, that all the tribes should sacrifice \add there, \add* and the temple of the habitation of the Most High was hallowed and built \add therein \add* for all ages. 
\v 5 And all the tribes which fell away together sacrificed to the heifer Baal, and so did the house of Naphtali my father. 
\v 6 And I alone went often to Jerusalem at the feasts, as it hath been ordained unto all Israel by an everlasting decree, having the firstfruits and the tenths of mine increase, and that which was first shorn; and I gave them at the altar to the priests the sons of Aaron. 
\v 7 The tenth part of all mine increase I gave to the sons of Levi, who ministered at Jerusalem: and the second tenth part I sold away, and went, and spent it each year at Jerusalem: 
\v 8 and the third I gave unto them to whom it was meet, as Deborah my father’s mother had commanded me, because I was left an orphan by my father. 
\v 9 And when I became a man, I took to wife Anna of the seed of our own family, and of her I begat Tobias. 
\v 10 And when I was carried away captive to Nineveh, all my brethren and those that were of my kindred did eat of the bread of the Gentiles: 
\v 11 but I kept myself from eating, 
\v 12 because I remembered God with all my soul. 
\v 13 And the Most High gave me grace and \f + \fr 1:13  \ft Gr. \fqa beauty. \f* favour in the sight of Enemessar, and I was his purveyor. 
\v 14 And I went into Media, and left in trust with Gabael, the brother of Gabrias, at Rages of Media, ten talents of silver. 
\p
\v 15 And when Enemessar was dead, Sennacherib his son reigned in his stead; and \f + \fr 1:15  \ft Gr. \fqa his highways were troubled. \f* in his time the highways were troubled, and I could no more go into Media. 
\v 16 And in the days of Enemessar I did many almsdeeds to my brethren: I gave my bread to the hungry, 
\v 17 and my garments to the naked: and if I saw any of my race dead, and cast forth \f + \fr 1:17  \ft Some ancient authorities read \fqa behind. \f* on the wall of Ninevah, I buried him. 
\v 18 And if Sennacherib the king slew any, when he came fleeing from Judaea, I buried them privily; for in his wrath he slew many; and the bodies were sought for by the king, and were not found. 
\v 19 But one of the Ninevites went and shewed to the king concerning me, how that I buried them, and hid myself; and when I knew that I was sought for to be put to death, I withdrew myself for fear. 
\v 20 And all my goods were forcibly taken away, and there was nothing left unto me, save my wife Anna and my son Tobias. 
\v 21 And there passed not five and fifty days, before two of his sons slew him, and they fled into the mountains of Ararat. And \f + \fr 1:21  \ft That is, \fqa Esar-haddon, \ft and so in ver. 22. \f* Sarchedonus his son reigned in his stead; and he appointed over all the accounts of his kingdom, and over all his affairs, Achiacharus my brother Anael’s son. 
\v 22 And Achiacharus made request for me, and I came to Nineveh. Now Achiacharus was cupbearer, and keeper of the signet, and steward, and overseer of the accounts: and Sarchedonus appointed him next unto himself: but he was my brother’s son. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 Now when I was come home again, and my wife Anna was restored unto me, and my son Tobias, in the feast of Pentecost, which is the holy feast of the seven weeks, there was a good dinner prepared me, and I sat down to eat. 
\v 2 And I saw abundance of meat, and I said to my son, Go and bring what poor man soever thou shalt find of our brethren, who is mindful of the Lord; and lo, I tarry for thee. 
\v 3 And he came, and said, Father, one of our race is strangled, and is cast out in the marketplace. 
\v 4 And before I had tasted aught, I sprang up, and took him up into a chamber until the sun was set. 
\v 5 And I returned, and washed myself, and ate my bread in heaviness, 
\v 6 and remembered the prophecy of Amos, as he said, 
\q1 \x + \xo 2:6  \xt Amos viii. 10.\x*Your feasts shall be turned into mourning, 
\q1 And all your mirth into lamentation. 
\p
\v 7 And I wept: and when the sun was set, I went and made a grave, and buried him. 
\v 8 And my neighbours mocked me, and said, He is no longer afraid to be put to death for this matter: and yet he fled away: and, lo, he burieth the dead again. 
\v 9 And the same night I returned from burying him, and slept by the wall of my courtyard, being polluted; and my face was uncovered: 
\v 10 and I knew not that there were sparrows in the wall; and, mine eyes being open, the sparrows muted warm dung into mine eyes, and white films came in mine eyes; and I went to the physicians, and they helped me not: but Achiacharus did nourish me, \f + \fr 2:10  \ft Some authorities read \fqa until he went. \f* until I went into Elymais. 
\p
\v 11 And my wife Anna did spin in the women’s chambers, 
\v 12 and did send the work back to the owners. And they on their part paid her wages, and gave her also besides a kid. 
\v 13 But when it came to my house, it began to cry, and I said unto her, From whence is this kid? is it stolen? render it to the owners; for it is not lawful to eat anything that is stolen. 
\v 14 But she said, It hath been given me for a gift more than the wages. And I did not believe her, and I bade her render it to the owners; and I was abashed at her. But she answered and said unto me, Where are thine alms and thy righteous deeds? behold, \f + \fr 2:14  \ft Gr. \fqa all things are known with thee. \f* thou and all thy works are known. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 And I was grieved and wept, and prayed in sorrow, saying, 
\p
\v 2 O Lord, thou art righteous, and all thy works and all thy ways are mercy and truth, and thou judgest true and righteous judgement for ever. 
\v 3 Remember me, and look on me; take not vengeance on me for my sins and mine ignorances, and \add the sins \add* of my fathers, which sinned before thee: 
\v 4 for they disobeyed thy commandments; and thou gavest us for a spoil, and for captivity, and for death, and for a proverb of reproach to all the nations among whom we are dispersed. 
\v 5 And now many are thy judgments, true are they; that thou shouldest deal with me according to my sins and \add the sins \add* of my fathers: because we did not keep thy commandments, for we walked not in truth before thee. 
\v 6 And now deal with me according to that which is pleasing in thy sight, command my spirit to be taken from me, that I may be released, and become earth: for it is profitable for me to die rather than to live, because I have heard false reproaches, and there is much sorrow in me: command that I be now released from my distress, and go to the everlasting place: turn not thy face away from me. 
\p
\v 7 The same day it happened unto Sarah the daughter of Raguel in Ecbatana of Media, that she also was reproached by her father’s maidservants; 
\v 8 because that she had been given to seven husbands, and Asmodaeus the evil \f + \fr 3:8  \ft Gr. \fqa demon. \f* spirit slew them, before they had lain with her. And they said unto her, Dost thou not know that thou stranglest thy husbands? thou hast had already seven husbands, and thou hast had no profit of any one of them. 
\v 9 Wherefore dost thou scourge us? if they be dead, go thy ways with them; let us never see of thee either son or daughter. 
\v 10 When she heard these things, she was grieved exceedingly, so that she thought to have hanged herself: and she said, I am the only daughter of my father; if I do this, it shall be a reproach unto him, and I shall bring down his old age with sorrow to \f + \fr 3:10  \ft Gr. \fqa Hades. \f* the grave. 
\v 11 And she prayed by the window, and said, Blessed art thou, O Lord my God, and blessed is thy holy and honourable name for ever: let all thy works praise thee for ever. 
\v 12 And now, Lord, I have set mine eyes and my face toward thee: 
\v 13 command that I be released from the earth, and that I no more hear reproach. 
\v 14 Thou knowest, Lord, that I am pure from all sin with man, 
\v 15 and that I never polluted my name, nor the name of my father, in the land of my captivity: I am the only daughter of my father, and he hath no child that shall be his heir, nor brother near him, nor son belonging to him, that I should keep myself for a wife unto him: seven husbands of mine are dead already; why should I live? And if it pleaseth thee not to slay me, command some regard to be had of me, and pity taken of me, and that I hear no more reproach. 
\p
\v 16 And the prayer of both was heard before the glory of the great \add God. \add* 
\v 17 Raphael also was sent to heal them both, to scale away the white films from Tobit’s eyes, and to give Sarah the daughter of Raguel for a wife to Tobias the son of Tobit; and to bind Asmodaeus the evil \f + \fr 3:17  \ft Gr. \fqa demon. \f* spirit; because it belonged to Tobias that he should inherit her. The selfsame time did Tobit return and enter into his house, and Sarah the daughter of Raguel came down from her upper chamber. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 In that day Tobit remembered concerning the money which he had left in trust with Gabael in Rages of Media, 
\v 2 and he said in himself, I have asked for death; why do I not call my son Tobias, that I may shew to him \add of the money \add* before I die? 
\v 3 And he called him, and said, 
\p My child, \f + \fr 4:3  \ft Gr. \fqa if. \f* when I die, bury me: and despise not thy mother; honour her all the days of thy life, and do that which is pleasing unto her, and grieve her not. 
\v 4 Remember, my child, that she hath seen many dangers for thee, \add when thou wast \add* in her womb. When she is dead, bury her by me in one grave. 
\v 5 My child, be mindful of the Lord our God all thy days, and let not thy will be set to sin and to transgress his commandments: do righteousness all the days of thy life, and follow not the ways of unrighteousness. 
\v 6 For if thou doest the truth, thy doings shall prosperously succeed to thee, and to all them that do righteousness. 
\v 7 Give alms of thy substance; and when thou givest alms, let not thine eye be envious: turn not away thy face from any poor man, and the face of God shall not be turned away from thee. 
\v 8 As thy substance is, give alms of it according to thine abundance: if thou have little, be not afraid to give alms according to that little: 
\v 9 for thou layest up a good treasure for thyself against the day of necessity: 
\v 10 because alms delivereth from death, and suffereth not to come into darkness. 
\v 11 Alms is a good gift in the sight of the Most High for all that give it. 
\v 12 Beware, my child, of all whoredom, and take first a wife of the seed of thy fathers, and take not a strange wife, which is not of thy father’s tribe: for we are the sons of the prophets. Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, our fathers of old time, remember, my child, that they all took wives of their brethren, and were blessed in their children, and their seed shall inherit the land. 
\v 13 And now, my child, love thy brethren, and scorn not in thy heart thy brethren, and the sons and the daughters of thy people, to take a wife of them: for in scornfulness is destruction and much trouble, and in naughtiness is decay and great want: for naughtiness is the mother of famine. 
\v 14 Let not the wages of any man, which shall work for thee, tarry with thee, but render it unto him out of hand: and if thou serve God, recompense shall be made unto thee. Take heed to thyself, my child, in all thy works, and be discreet in all thy behaviour. 
\v 15 And what thou thyself hatest, do to no man. Drink not wine unto drunkenness, and let not drunkenness go with thee on thy way. 
\v 16 Give of thy bread to the hungry, and of thy garments to them that are naked: of all thine abundance give alms; and let not thine eye be envious when thou givest alms. 
\v 17 Pour out thy bread on the \f + \fr 4:17  \ft Or, \fqa tomb \f* burial of the just, and give nothing to sinners. 
\v 18 Ask counsel of every man that is wise, and despise not any counsel that is profitable. 
\v 19 And bless the Lord thy God at all times, and ask of him that thy ways may be made straight, and that all thy paths and counsels may prosper: for every nation hath not counsel; but the Lord himself giveth all good things, and he humbleth whom he will, as he will. And now, my child, remember my commandments, and let them not be blotted out of thy mind. 
\v 20 And now I shew thee of the ten talents of silver, which I left in trust with Gabael the son of Gabrias at Rages of Media. 
\v 21 And fear not, my child, because we are made poor: thou hast much wealth, if thou fear God, and depart from all sin, and do that which is pleasing in his sight. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 And Tobias answered and said unto him, Father, I will do all things, whatsoever thou hast commanded me: 
\v 2 but how shall I be able to receive the money, seeing I know him not? 
\v 3 And he gave him the handwriting, and said unto him, Seek thee a man which shall go with thee, and I will give him wages, whiles I yet live: and go and receive the money. 
\v 4 And he went to seek a man, and found Raphael which was an angel; 
\v 5 and he knew it not; and he said unto him, Can I go with thee to Rages of Media? and knowest thou the places well? 
\v 6 And the angel said unto him, I will go with thee, and I know the way well: and I have lodged with our brother Gabael. 
\v 7 And Tobias said unto him, Wait for me, and I will tell my father. 
\v 8 And he said unto him, Go, and tarry not. And he went in and said to his father, Behold, I have found one which will go with me. But he said, Call him unto me, that I may know of what tribe he is, and whether he be a trusty man to go with thee. 
\p
\v 9 And he called him, and he came in, and they saluted one another. 
\v 10 And Tobit said unto him, Brother, of what tribe and of what family art thou? Shew me. 
\v 11 And he said unto him, Seekest thou a tribe and a family, or a hired man which shall go with thy son? And Tobit said unto him, I would know, brother, thy kindred and thy name. 
\v 12 And he said, I am Azarias, the son of Ananias the great, of thy brethren. 
\v 13 And he said unto him, Welcome, brother; and be not angry with me, because I sought to know thy tribe and family: and thou art my brother, of an honest and good lineage: for I knew Ananias and Jathan, the sons of Shemaiah the great, when we went together to Jerusalem to worship, and offered the firstborn, and the tenths of our increase; and they went not astray in the error of our brethren: my brother, thou art of a great stock. 
\v 14 But tell me, what wages shall I give thee? a drachma a day, and those things that be necessary for thee, as unto my son? 
\v 15 And moreover, if ye return safe and sound, I will add something to thy wages. 
\v 16 And so they consented. And he said to Tobias, Prepare thyself for the journey, and God prosper you. And his son prepared what was needful for the journey, and his father said unto him, Go thou with this man; but God, which dwelleth in heaven, shall prosper your journey; and may his angel go with you. And they both went forth to depart, and the young man’s dog with them. 
\p
\v 17 But Anna his mother wept, and said to Tobit, Why hast thou sent away our child? is he not the staff of our hand, in going in and out before us? 
\v 18 Be not greedy to add money to money: but let it be as refuse in respect of our child. 
\v 19 For as the Lord hath given us to live, so doth it suffice us. 
\v 20 And Tobit said to her, Take no care, my sister; he shall return safe and sound, and thine eyes shall see him. 
\v 21 For a good angel shall go with him, and his journey shall be prospered, and he shall return safe and sound. 
\v 22 And she made an end of weeping. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1 Now as they went on their journey, they came at eventide to the river Tigris, and they lodged there. 
\v 2 But the young man went down to wash himself, and a fish leaped out of the river, and would have swallowed up the young man. 
\v 3 But the angel said unto him, Take hold on the fish. And the young man caught hold of the fish, and cast it up on the land. 
\v 4 And the angel said unto him, Cut the fish open, and take the heart and the liver and the gall, and put them up safely. 
\v 5 And the young man did as the angel commanded him; but they roasted the fish, and ate it. And they both went on their way, till they drew near to Ecbatana. 
\v 6 And the young man said to the angel, Brother Azarias, to what use is the heart and the liver and the gall of the fish? 
\v 7 And he said unto him, Touching the heart and the liver, if a \f + \fr 6:7  \ft Gr. \fqa demon. \f* devil or an evil spirit trouble any, we must make a smoke thereof before the man or the woman, and the party shall be no more vexed. 
\v 8 But as for the gall, \add it is good \add* to anoint a man that hath white films in his eyes, and he shall be healed. 
\p
\v 9 But when they drew nigh unto Rages, 
\v 10 the angel said to the young man, Brother, to-day we shall lodge with Raguel, and he is thy kinsman; and he hath an only daughter, named Sarah. I will speak for her, that she should be given thee for a wife. 
\v 11 For to thee doth the inheritance of her appertain, and thou only art of her kindred: 
\v 12 and the maid is fair and wise. And now hear me, and I will speak to her father; and when we return from Rages we will celebrate the marriage: for I know that Raguel may in no wise marry her to another according to the law of Moses, or else he shall be liable to death, because it appertaineth unto thee to take the inheritance, rather than any other. 
\v 13 Then the young man said unto the angel, Brother Azarias, I have heard that this maid hath been given to seven men, and that they all perished in the bride-chamber. 
\v 14 And now I am the only son of my father, and I am afraid, lest I go in and die, even as those before me: for a \f + \fr 6:14  \ft Gr. \fqa demon, \ft and so in ver. 15, 17. \f* devil loveth her, which hurteth no man, but those which come unto her: and now I fear lest I die, and bring my father’s and my mother’s life to the grave with sorrow because of me: and they have no other son to bury them. 
\v 15 But the angel said unto him, Dost thou not remember the words which thy father commanded thee, that thou shouldest take a wife of thine own kindred? and now hear me, brother; for she shall be thy wife; and make thou no reckoning of the devil; for this night shall she be given thee to wife. 
\v 16 And \f + \fr 6:16  \ft Gr. \fqa if. \f* when thou shalt come into the bride-chamber, thou shalt take the ashes of incense, and shalt lay upon them some of the heart and liver of the fish, and shalt make a smoke \add therewith: \add* 
\v 17 and the devil shall smell it, and flee away, and never come again any more. But when thou goest nigh unto her, rise up both of you, and cry to God which is merciful, and he shall save you, and have mercy on you. Fear not, for she was prepared for thee from the beginning; and thou shalt save her, and she shall go with thee. And I suppose that thou shalt have children of her. And when Tobias heard these things, he loved her, and his soul clave to her exceedingly. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1 And they came to Ecbatana, and arrived at the house of Raguel. But Sarah met them; and she saluted them, and they her; and she brought them into the house. 
\v 2 And he said to Edna his wife, How like is the young man to Tobit my cousin. 
\v 3 And Raguel asked them, From whence are ye, brethren? And they said unto him, We are of the sons of Naphtali, which are captives in Nineveh. 
\v 4 And he said unto them, Know ye Tobit our brother? But they said, We know him. And he said unto them, Is he in good health? 
\v 5 But they said, He is both alive, and in good health: and Tobias said, He is my father. 
\v 6 And Raguel sprang up, and kissed him, and wept, 
\v 7 and blessed him, and said unto him, Thou art the son of an honest and good man. And when he had heard that Tobit had lost his sight, he was grieved, and wept; 
\v 8 and Edna his wife and Sarah his daughter wept. And they received them gladly; and they killed a ram of the flock, and set store of meat before them. 
\p But Tobias said to Raphael, Brother Azarias, speak of those things of which thou didst talk in the way, and let the matter be finished. 
\v 9 And he communicated the thing to Raguel: and Raguel said to Tobias, Eat and drink, and make merry: 
\v 10 for it appertaineth unto thee to take my child. Howbeit I will shew thee the truth. 
\v 11 I have given my child to seven men, and whensoever they came in unto her, they died in the night. But for the present be merry. And Tobias said, I will taste nothing here, until ye make covenant and enter into covenant with me. 
\v 12 And Raguel said, Take her to thyself from henceforth according to the manner: thou art her brother, and she is thine: but the merciful God shall give all good success to you. 
\v 13 And he called his daughter Sarah, and took her by the hand, and gave her to be wife to Tobias, and said, Behold, take her to thyself after the law of Moses, and lead her away to thy father. And he blessed them; 
\v 14 And he called Edna his wife, and took a book, and wrote an instrument, and sealed it. 
\v 15 And they began to eat. 
\p
\v 16 And Raguel called his wife Edna, and said unto her, Sister, prepare the other chamber, and bring her in thither. 
\v 17 And she did as he bade her, and brought her in thither: and she wept, and she received the tears of her daughter, and said unto her, 
\v 18 Be of good comfort, my child; the Lord of heaven and earth give thee \f + \fr 7:18  \ft Many ancient authorities read \fqa joy. \f* favour for this thy sorrow: be of good comfort, my daughter. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1 And when they had finished their supper, they brought Tobias in unto her. 
\v 2 But as he went, he remembered the words of Raphael, and took the ashes of the incense, and put the heart and the liver of the fish thereupon, and made a smoke \add therewith. \add* 
\v 3 But when the \f + \fr 8:3  \ft Gr. \fqa demon. \f* devil smelled the smell, he fled into the uppermost parts of Egypt, and the angel bound him. 
\v 4 But after they were both shut in together, Tobias rose up from the bed, and said, Sister, arise, and let us pray that the Lord may have mercy on us. 
\v 5 And Tobias began to say, Blessed art thou, O God of our fathers, and blessed is thy holy and glorious name for ever; let the heavens bless thee, and all thy creatures. 
\v 6 Thou madest Adam, and gavest him Eve his wife for a helper and a stay: of them came the seed of men: thou didst say, it is not good that the man should be alone; let us make him a helper like unto him. 
\v 7 And now, O Lord, I take not this my sister for lust, but in truth: command that I may find mercy and grow old with her. 
\v 8 And she said with him, Amen. And they slept both that night. 
\p
\v 9 And Raguel arose, and went and digged a grave, 
\v 10 saying, Lest he also should die. 
\v 11 And Raguel came into his house, 
\v 12 and said to Edna his wife, Send one of the maidservants, and let them see whether he be alive: but if not, that we may bury him, and no man know it. 
\v 13 So the maidservant opened the door, and went in, and found them both sleeping, 
\v 14 and came forth, and told them that he was alive. 
\v 15 And Raguel blessed God, saying, 
\p Blessed art thou, O God, with all pure and holy blessing; and let thy saints bless thee, and all thy creatures; and let all thine angels and thine elect bless thee for ever. 
\v 16 Blessed art thou, because thou hast made me glad; and it hath not befallen me as I suspected; but thou hast dealt with us according to thy great mercy. 
\v 17 Blessed art thou, because thou hast had mercy on two that were the only begotten children of their parents: shew them mercy, O Lord; accomplish their life in health with gladness and mercy. 
\p
\v 18 But he commanded his servants to fill the grave. 
\v 19 And he kept the wedding feast for them fourteen days. 
\v 20 And before the days of the wedding feast were finished, Raguel sware unto him, that he should not depart till the fourteen days of the wedding feast were fulfilled; 
\v 21 and that then he should take the half of his goods, and go in safety to his father; and the rest, \add said he, \add* when I and my wife shall die. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 And Tobias called Raphael, and said unto him, 
\v 2 Brother Azarias, take with thee a servant, and two camels, and go to Rages of Media to Gabael, and receive the money for me, and bring him to the wedding feast: 
\v 3 because Raguel hath sworn that I shall not depart; 
\v 4 and my father counteth the days; and if I tarry long, he will be sorely grieved. 
\v 5 And Raphael went on his way, and lodged with Gabael, and gave him the handwriting: but he brought forth the bags with their seals, and gave them to him. 
\v 6 And they rose up early in the morning together, and came to the wedding feast: and Tobias blessed his wife. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1 And Tobit his father made his count every day: and when the days of the journey were expired, and they came not, 
\v 2 he said, \f + \fr 10:2  \ft Many ancient authorities read \fqa Are they perchance put to shame? \f* Is he perchance detained? or is Gabael perchance dead, and there is no man to give him the money? 
\v 3 And he was sorely grieved. 
\v 4 But his wife said unto him, The child hath perished, seeing he tarrieth long; and she began to bewail him, and said, 
\v 5  \f + \fr 10:5  \ft Some authorities read \fqa Woe is me. \f* I care for nothing, my child, since I have let thee go, the light of mine eyes. 
\v 6 And Tobit saith unto her, Hold thy peace, take no care; he is in good health. 
\v 7 And she said unto him, Hold thy peace, deceive me not; my child hath perished. And she went out every day into the way by which they went, and did eat no bread in the day-time, and ceased not whole nights to bewail her son Tobias, until the fourteen days of the wedding feast were expired, which Raguel had sworn that he should spend there. 
\p But Tobias said unto Raguel, Send me away, for my father and my mother look no more to see me. 
\v 8 But his father in law said unto him, Abide with me, and I will send to thy father, and they shall declare unto him how things go with thee. 
\v 9 And Tobias saith, No; but send me away to my father. 
\v 10 But Raguel arose, and gave him Sarah his wife, and half his goods, servants and cattle and money; 
\v 11 and he blessed them, and sent them away, saying, The God of heaven shall prosper you, my children, before I die. 
\v 12 And he said to his daughter, Honour thy father and thy mother in law; they are now thy parents; let me hear a good report of thee. And he kissed her. And Edna said to Tobias, The Lord of heaven restore thee, dear brother, and grant to me that I may see thy children of my daughter Sarah, that I may rejoice before the Lord: and, behold, I commit my daughter unto thee in special trust: vex her not. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 After these things Tobias also went his way, blessing God because he had prospered his journey; and he blessed Raguel and Edna his wife. And he went on his way till they drew near unto Nineveh. 
\v 2 And Raphael said to Tobias, Knowest thou not, brother, how thou didst leave thy father? 
\v 3 Let us run forward before thy wife, and prepare the house. 
\v 4 But take in thy hand the gall of the fish. And they went their way, and the dog went after them. 
\v 5 And Anna sat looking about toward the way for her son. 
\v 6 And she espied him coming, and said to his father, Behold, thy son cometh, and the man that went with him. 
\v 7 And Raphael said, I know, Tobias, that thy father will open his eyes. 
\v 8 Do thou therefore anoint his eyes with the gall, and being pricked therewith, he shall rub, and shall make the white films to fall away, and he shall see thee. 
\p
\v 9 And Anna ran unto him, and fell upon the neck of her son, and said unto him, I have seen thee, my child; from henceforth I will die. And they wept both. 
\v 10 And Tobit went forth toward the door, and stumbled: but his son ran unto him, 
\v 11 and took hold of his father: and he strake the gall on his father’s eyes, saying, Be of good cheer, my father. 
\v 12 But when his eyes began to smart, he rubbed them; 
\v 13 and the white films scaled away from the corners of his eyes; and he saw his son, and fell upon his neck. 
\v 14 And he wept, and said, Blessed art thou, O God, and blessed is thy name for ever, and blessed are all thy holy angels; 
\v 15 for thou didst scourge, and didst have mercy on me: behold, I see my son Tobias. And his son went in rejoicing, and told his father the great things that had happened to him in Media. 
\p
\v 16 And Tobit went out to meet his daughter in law at the gate of Nineveh, rejoicing, and blessing God: and they which saw him go marvelled, because he had received his sight. 
\v 17 And Tobit gave thanks before them, because God had shewed mercy on him. And when Tobit came near to Sarah his daughter in law, he blessed her, saying, Welcome, daughter: blessed is God which hath brought thee unto us, and \add blessed are \add* thy father and thy mother. And there was joy to all his brethren which were at Nineveh. 
\v 18 And Achiacharus, and Nasbas his brother’s son, came: 
\v 19 and Tobias’ wedding feast was kept seven days with great gladness. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 And Tobit called his son Tobias, and said unto him, See, my child, that the man which went with thee have his wages, and thou must give him more. 
\v 2 And he said unto him, Father, it is no harm to me to give him the half of those things which I have brought: 
\v 3 for he hath led me for thee in safety, and he cured my wife, and brought my money, and likewise cured thee. 
\v 4 And the old man said, It is due unto him. 
\v 5 And he called the angel, and said unto him, Take the half of all that ye have brought. 
\v 6 Then he called them both privily, and said unto them, 
\p Bless God, and give him thanks, and magnify him, and give him thanks in the sight of all that live, for the things which he hath done with you. It is good to bless God and exalt his name, shewing forth with honour the works of God; and be not slack to give him thanks. 
\v 7 It is good to keep close the secret of a king, but to reveal gloriously the works of God. Do good, and evil shall not find you. 
\v 8 Good is prayer with fasting and alms and righteousness. A little with righteousness is better than much with unrighteousness. It is better to give alms than to lay up gold: 
\v 9 alms doth deliver from death, and it shall purge away all sin. They that do alms and righteousness shall be filled with life; 
\v 10 but they that sin are enemies to their own life. 
\v 11 Surely I will keep close nothing from you. I have said, It is good to keep close the secret of a king, but to reveal gloriously the works of God. 
\v 12 And now, when thou didst pray, and Sarah thy daughter in law, I did bring the memorial of your prayer before the Holy One: and when thou didst bury the dead, I was with thee likewise. 
\v 13 And when thou didst not delay to rise up, and leave thy dinner, that thou mightest go and cover the dead, thy good deed was not hid from me: but I was with thee. 
\v 14 And now God did send me to heal thee and Sarah thy daughter in law. 
\v 15 I am Raphael, one of the seven holy angels, which present the prayers of the saints, and go in before the glory of the Holy One. 
\p
\v 16 And they were both troubled, and fell upon their faces; for they were afraid. 
\v 17 And he said unto them, Be not afraid, ye shall have peace; but bless God for ever. 
\v 18 For not of any favour of mine, but by the will of your God I came; wherefore bless him for ever. 
\v 19 All these days did I appear unto you; and I did neither eat nor drink, but ye saw a vision. 
\v 20 And now give God thanks: because I ascend to him that sent me: and write in a book all the things which have been done. 
\v 21 And they rose up, and saw him no more. 
\v 22 And they confessed the great and wonderful works of God, and how the angel of the Lord had appeared unto them. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 And Tobit wrote a prayer for rejoicing, and said, 
\q1 Blessed is God that liveth for ever, 
\q1 And \add blessed is \add* his kingdom. 
\q1
\v 2 For he scourgeth, and sheweth mercy: 
\q1 He leadeth down to \f + \fr 13:2  \ft Gr. \fqa Hades. \f* the grave, and bringeth up again: 
\q1 And there is none that shall escape his hand. 
\q1
\v 3 Give thanks unto him before the Gentiles, ye children of Israel: 
\q1 For he hath scattered us among them. 
\q1
\v 4 There declare his greatness, 
\q1 And extol him before all the living: 
\q1 Because he is our Lord, 
\q1 And God is our Father for ever. 
\q1
\v 5 And he will scourge us for our iniquities, and will again shew mercy, 
\q1 And will gather us out of all the nations among whom ye are scattered. 
\q1
\v 6 If ye turn to him with your whole heart and with your whole soul, 
\q1 To do truth before him, 
\q1 Then will he turn unto you, 
\q1 And will not hide his face from you. 
\q1 And see what he will do with you, 
\q1 And give him thanks with your whole mouth, 
\q1 And bless the Lord of righteousness, 
\q1 And exalt the everlasting King. 
\q1 I in the land of my captivity give him thanks, 
\q1 And shew his strength and majesty to a nation of sinners. 
\q1 Turn, ye sinners, and do righteousness before him: 
\q1 Who can tell if he will accept you and have mercy on you? 
\q1
\v 7 I exalt my God, 
\q1 And my soul \add doth exalt \add* the King of heaven, 
\q1 And it shall rejoice in his greatness. 
\q1
\v 8 Let all men speak, and let them give him thanks in Jerusalem. 
\q1
\v 9 O Jerusalem, the holy city, 
\q1 He will scourge thee for the works of thy sons, 
\q1 And will again have mercy on the sons of the righteous. 
\q1
\v 10 Give thanks to the Lord with goodness, 
\q1 And bless the everlasting King, 
\q1 That his tabernacle may be builded in thee again with joy, 
\q1 And that he may make glad in thee those that are captives, 
\q1 And love in thee for ever those that are miserable. 
\q1
\v 11 Many nations shall come from far to the name of the Lord God 
\q1 With gifts in their hands, even gifts to the King of heaven; 
\q1 Generations of generations shall praise thee, 
\q1 And sing songs of rejoicing. 
\q1
\v 12 Cursed are all they that hate thee; 
\q1 Blessed shall be all they that love thee for ever. 
\q1
\v 13 Rejoice and be exceeding glad for the sons of the righteous: 
\q1 For they shall be gathered together and shall bless the Lord of the righteous. 
\q1
\v 14 O blessed are they that love thee; 
\q1 They shall rejoice for thy peace: 
\q1 Blessed are all they that sorrowed for all thy scourges: 
\q1 Because they shall rejoice for thee, 
\q1 When they have seen all thy glory; 
\q1 And they shall be made glad for ever. 
\q1
\v 15 Let my soul bless God the great King. 
\q1
\v 16 For Jerusalem shall be builded with sapphires and emeralds and precious stones; 
\q1 Thy walls and towers and battlements with pure gold. 
\q1
\v 17 And the streets of Jerusalem shall be paved with beryl and carbuncle and stones of Ophir. 
\q1
\v 18 And all her streets shall say, Hallelujah, and give praise, 
\q1 Saying, Blessed is God, which hath exalted \add thee \add* for ever. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1 And Tobit made an end of giving thanks. 
\v 2 And he was eight and fifty years old when he lost his sight; and after eight years he received it again: and he gave alms, and he feared the Lord God more and more, and gave thanks unto him. 
\p
\v 3 Now he grew very old; and he called his son, and the six sons of his son, and said unto him, 
\p My child, take thy sons: behold, I am grown old, and am ready to depart out of this life. 
\v 4 Go into Media, my child, for I surely believe all the things which Jonah the prophet spake of Nineveh, that it shall be overthrown, but in Media there shall rather be peace for a season; and that our brethren shall be scattered in the earth from the good land; and Jerusalem shall be desolate, and the house of God in it shall be burned up, and shall be desolate for a time; 
\v 5 and God shall again have mercy on them, and bring them back into the land, and they shall build the house, but not like to the former \add house, \add* until the times of that age be fulfilled; and afterward they shall return from the places of their captivity, and build up Jerusalem with honour, and the house of God shall be built in it for ever with a glorious building, even as the prophets spake concerning it. 
\v 6 And all the nations shall turn to fear the Lord God truly, and shall bury their idols. 
\v 7 And all the nations shall bless the Lord, and his people shall give thanks unto God, and the Lord shall exalt his people; and all they that love the Lord God in truth and righteousness shall rejoice, shewing mercy to our brethren. 
\v 8 And now, my child, depart from Nineveh, because those things which the prophet Jonah spake shall surely come to pass. 
\v 9 But keep thou the law and the ordinances, and shew thyself merciful and righteous, that it may be well with thee. 
\v 10 And bury me decently, and thy mother with me; and dwell ye no longer at Nineveh. See, my child, what Aman did to Achiacharus that nourished him, how out of light he brought him into darkness, and all the recompense that he made him: and Achiacharus was saved, but the other had his recompense, and he went down into darkness. Manasses gave alms, and escaped the snare of death which he set for him: but Aman fell into the snare, and perished. 
\v 11 And now, my children, consider what alms doeth, and how righteousness doth deliver. 
\p And while he was saying these things, he gave up the ghost in the bed; but he was a hundred and eight and fifty years old; and he buried him magnificently. 
\v 12 And when Anna died, he buried her with his father. But Tobias departed with his wife and his sons to Ecbatana unto Raguel his father in law, 
\v 13 and he grew old in honour, and he buried his father and mother in law magnificently, and he inherited their substance, and his father Tobit’s. 
\v 14 And he died at Ecbatana of Media, being a hundred and seven and twenty years old. 
\v 15 And before he died he heard of the destruction of Nineveh, which Nebuchadnezzar and Ahasuerus took captive; and before his death he rejoiced over Nineveh.
