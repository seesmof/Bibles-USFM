\v 1 O LORD Almighty, that art in heaven, thou God of our fathers, of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and of their righteous seed; 
\v 2 who hast made heaven and earth, with all the \f + \fr 1:2 \ft Or, \fqa order \ft Or, \fqa array \ft Gen. ii. 1 (Sept.).\f* ornament thereof; 
\v 3 who hast bound the sea by the word of thy commandment; who hast shut up the deep, and sealed it by thy terrible and glorious name; 
\v 4 whom all things fear, yea, tremble before thy power; 
\v 5 for the majesty of thy glory cannot be borne, and the anger of thy threatening toward sinners is importable: 
\v 6 thy merciful promise is unmeasurable and unsearchable; 
\v 7 for thou art the Lord Most High, of great compassion, longsuffering and abundant in mercy, and repentest \f + \fr 1:7 \ft Gr. \fqa of the evils of men.\f* of bringing evils upon men. 
\v 8  \f + \fr 1:8 \ft The Alex. MS. omits \fqa Thou... saved.\f*Thou, O Lord, according to thy great goodness hast promised repentance and forgiveness to them that have sinned against thee: and of thine infinite mercies hast appointed repentance unto sinners, that they may be saved. Thou therefore, O Lord, that art the God of the just, hast not appointed repentance to the just, to Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, which have not sinned against thee; but thou hast appointed repentance unto me that am a sinner: 
\v 9 for I have sinned above the number of the sands of the sea. My transgressions are multiplied, \f + \fr 1:9 \ft The Alex. MS. omits \fqa O Lord... multiplied.\f* O Lord: my transgressions are multiplied, and I am not worthy to behold and see the height of heaven for the multitude of mine iniquities. 
\v 10 I am bowed down with many iron bands, that I cannot lift up mine head \f + \fr 1:10 \ft Some authorities omit \fqa by reason of my sins.\f*by reason of my sins, neither have I any respite: for I have provoked thy wrath, and done that which is evil before thee: \f + \fr 1:10 \ft The Alex. MS. omits \fqa I did... commandments.\f*I did not thy will, neither kept I thy commandments: I have set up abominations, and have multiplied \f + \fr 1:10 \ft Or, \fqa stumbling-blocks\f*detestable things. 
\v 11 Now therefore I bow the knee of mine heart, beseeching thee of grace. 
\v 12 I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned, and I acknowledge mine iniquities: 
\v 13 but, I humbly beseech thee, forgive me, O Lord, forgive me, and destroy me not with mine iniquities. Be not angry with me for ever, by reserving evil for me; neither condemn me into the lower parts of the earth. For thou, \f + \fr 1:13 \ft Another reading is, \fqa O God.\f* O Lord, art the God of them that repent; 
\v 14 and in me thou wilt shew all thy goodness: for thou wilt save me, that am unworthy, according to thy great mercy. 
\v 15 And I will praise thee for ever all the days of my life: for all the host of heaven doth sing thy praise, and thine is the glory for ever and ever. Amen.
