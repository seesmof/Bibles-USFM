\v 1 Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy the brother, to Philemon our beloved friend and fellow-laborer, 
\v 2 and to the beloved Apphia, and to Archippus our fellow-soldier, and to the church in thy house: 
\v 3 Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
\v 4 I thank my God at all times, making mention of thee in my prayers, 
\v 5 hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints; 
\v 6 that the fellowship of thy faith may become effectual in the knowledge of every good thing which is in us, for Christ Jesus. 
\v 7 For we have great thankfulness and comfort on account of thy love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed by thee, brother. 
\v 8 Wherefore, though I have much boldness in Christ to enjoin upon thee that which is befitting, 
\v 9 yet for love's sake I beseech thee rather; being such a one as Paul an old man, and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus, 
\v 10 I beseech thee for my child, whom I begot in my bonds, Onesimus; 
\v 11 who in time past was unprofitable to thee, but is now profitable to thee and to me; 
\v 12 whom I have sent back; and do thou [[receive]] him, that is, my own flesh. 
\v 13 Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might minister to me in the bonds of the gospel; 
\v 14 but I chose to do nothing without thy consent, that thy benefit may be not as from necessity, but willingly. 
\v 15 For perhaps he was separated from thee for a season to this end, that thou shouldst receive him back as thine for ever; 
\v 16 no longer as a bond-servant, but above a bond-servant, a brother beloved, especially to me, but how much more to thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord! 
\v 17 If thou then regardest me as a partner, receive him as myself. 
\v 18 And if he wronged thee in anything, or oweth thee, put that to my account. 
\v 19 I Paul have written it with my own hand, I will repay it; not to say to thee, that to me thou owest even thy own self besides. 
\v 20 Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ. 
\v 21 Having confidence in thy obedience I have written to thee, knowing that thou wilt do even more than I say. 
\v 22 And at the same time make ready a lodging for me; for I hope that through your prayers I shall be granted to you. 
\v 23 Epaphras, my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus, 
\v 24 Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow-laborers, salute thee. 
\v 25 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
