\p
\v 1 Inasmuch as many have undertaken to arrange a narrative of those things which are fully believed among us, 
\v 2 even as they were delivered to us by those who were eye-witnesses from the beginning and became ministers of the word, 
\v 3 it seemed good to me also, having accurately traced up all things from the first, to write to thee a connected account, most excellent Theophilus, 
\v 4 that thou mightst know the exact truth with regard to those things in which thou wast instructed. 
\v 5 There was in the days of Herod, king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zachariah, of the course of Abijah; and he had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth. 
\v 6 And they were both righteous in the sight of God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless. 
\v 7 And they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both far advanced in years. 
\v 8 And it came to pass, that, while he was serving as priest before God in the order of his course, 
\v 9 according to the custom of the priesthood the lot fell to him to go into the temple of the Lord and burn the incense. 
\v 10 And the whole multitude of the people was praying without at the time of the incense. 
\v 11 And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord, standing on the right of the altar of incense. 
\v 12 And Zachariah was troubled at the sight, and fear fell upon him. 
\v 13 But the angel said to him, Fear not, Zachariah; for thy prayer was heard, and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son; and thou shalt call his name John. 
\v 14 And thou wilt have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice for his birth. 
\v 15 For he will be great in the sight of the Lord; and will drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit from his very birth. 
\v 16 And many of the sons of Israel will he turn to the Lord their God. 
\v 17 And he will go before his face in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of fathers to children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, to make ready for the Lord a prepared people. 
\v 18 And Zachariah said to the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife is far advanced in years. 
\v 19 And the angel answering said to him, I am Gabriel, who stand in the presence of God; and I was sent to speak to thee, and to tell thee these glad tidings. 
\v 20 And lo! thou shalt be silent, and not able to speak, until the day when these things shall come to pass, because thou didst not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their season. 
\v 21 And the people were looking for Zachariah, and wondering that he remained so long in the temple. 
\v 22 And on coming out, he was not able to speak to them; and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple; and he was beckoning to them, and remained speechless. 
\v 23 And it came to pass, when the days of his ministration were completed, that he returned to his house. 
\v 24 And after those days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying, 
\v 25 Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me to take away my reproach among men. 
\v 26 And in her sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee, called Nazareth, 
\v 27 to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary. 
\v 28 And the angel came in to her and said, Hail, thou that art highly favored! the Lord is with thee. 
\v 29 And she was troubled at the words, and was considering what this salutation could mean. 
\v 30 And the angel said to her, Fear not, Mary; for thou hast found favor with God. 
\v 31 And lo! thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and hear a son, and shalt call his name Jesus. 
\v 32 He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give to him the throne of David his father; 
\v 33 and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end. 
\v 34 Then said Mary to the angel, How shall this be, since I know not a man? 
\v 35 And the angel answering said to her, The Holy Spirit will come upon thee, and the power of the Most High will overshadow thee; wherefore the holy one that is to be born will be called the Son of God. 
\v 36 And lo! Elizabeth, thy kinswoman, she also hath conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her who is called barren. 
\v 37 For nothing will be impossible with God. 
\v 38 And Mary said, Lo, the handmaid of the Lord! May it be to me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her. 
\v 39 And Mary arose and went in those days into the hill-country with haste, into a city of Judah. 
\v 40 And she entered the house of Zachariah, and saluted Elizabeth. 
\v 41 And it came to pass, when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, that the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit, 
\v 42 and cried out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art thou among women; and blessed is the fruit of thy womb! 
\v 43 And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? 
\v 44 For lo! as soon as the voice of thy salutation came to my ears, the babe leaped in my womb in exultation. 
\v 45 And blessed is she who hath believed that there will be an accomplishment of those things which were told her from the Lord. 
\v 46 And Mary said, My soul magnifieth the Lord, 
\v 47 and my spirit hath exulted in God my Saviour; 
\v 48 for he hath looked upon the low estate of his handmaiden. For lo! from this time all generations will call me blessed; 
\v 49 for the Mighty One hath done great things for me; and holy is his name; 
\v 50 and his mercy is from generation to generation on them that fear him. 
\v 51 He hath wrought mightily with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the device of their heart. 
\v 52 He hath cast down princes from thrones, and exalted men of low degree. 
\v 53 The hungry he hath filled with good things, and the rich he hath sent away empty. 
\v 54 He hath given help to Israel his servant, in remembrance of his mercy 
\v 55 toward Abraham and his offspring for ever, as he spoke to our fathers. 
\v 56 And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house. 
\v 57 Now Elizabeth's full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son. 
\v 58 And her neighbors and her kinsfolk heard that the Lord had showed great mercy toward her; and they rejoiced with her. 
\v 59 And it came to pass that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they were about to call him Zachariah, after the name of his father. 
\v 60 And his mother answering said, Not so; but he shall be called John. 
\v 61 And they said to her, There is no one of thy kindred that is called by this name. 
\v 62 And they made signs to his father, how he would have him named. 
\v 63 And he asked for a writing-tablet, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they all marveled. 
\v 64 And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue was loosed; and he spoke, blessing God. 
\v 65 And fear came on all that dwelt around them; and all these things were talked of throughout the whole of the hill-country of Judaea. 
\v 66 And all that heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What then will this child be? For the hand of the Lord was with him. 
\v 67 And Zachariah his father was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying, 
\v 68 Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel! for he hath visited and redeemed his people, 
\v 69 and hath raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of David his servant,— 
\v 70 as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets of old, 
\v 71 salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us, 
\v 72 to accomplish his mercy toward our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant, 
\v 73 the oath which he swore to Abraham our father, 
\v 74 to grant to us, that being delivered from the hand of our enemies, we might worship him without fear, 
\v 75 in holiness and righteousness before him, all our days. 
\v 76 And thou, child, shalt be called a prophet of the Most High; for thou shalt go in advance before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways, 
\v 77 to give knowledge of salvation to his people in the remission of their sins 
\v 78 through the tender mercy of our God, whereby the day-spring from on high hath visited us, 
\v 79 to give light to those sitting in darkness and the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace. 
\v 80 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit; and was in the deserts till the day of his manifestation to Israel.

\v 1 And it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be registered. 
\v 2 (This registering was the first made while Quirinius was governor of Syria.) 
\v 3 And all went to be registered, each to his own city. 
\v 4 And Joseph also went up from Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into Judaea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, 
\v 5 to be registered with Mary who had been betrothed to him, who was with child. 
\v 6 And it came to pass, while they were there, that the days for her delivery were completed. 
\v 7 And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swathing-clothes, and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn. 
\v 8 And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, and keeping watch over their flock by night. 
\v 9 And an angel of the Lord came to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them; and they were in great fear. 
\v 10 And the angel said to them, Fear not; for lo! I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to the whole people; 
\v 11 for to you hath been born this day, in the city of David, a Saviour, who is the Christ, the Lord. 
\v 12 And this shall be the sign to you: Ye shall find a babe wrapped in swathing-clothes, [[lying]] in a manger. 
\v 13 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, 
\v 14 “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among men of good will!” 
\v 15 And it came to pass, when the angels had gone away from them into heaven, that the shepherds said one to another, Let us go at once to Bethlehem, and see that which hath come to pass, which the Lord hath made known to us. 
\v 16 And they came with haste, and found Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in the manger. 
\v 17 And when they had seen it, they made known abroad what had been told them concerning this child. 
\v 18 And all who heard wondered at the things which were told them by the shepherds. 
\v 19 But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart. 
\v 20 And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all which they had heard and seen, as had been told them. 
\v 21 And when eight days were completed for him to be circumcised, his name was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb. 
\v 22 And when the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were completed, they brought him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord, 
\v 23 as it is written in the law of the Lord: “Every first-born male shall be called holy to the Lord,” 
\v 24 and to offer a sacrifice, according to what is directed in the law of the Lord: “A pair of turtle doves, or two young pigeons.” 
\v 25 And lo! there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and he was a righteous and devout man, waiting for the consolation of Israel. And the Holy Spirit was upon him; 
\v 26 and it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death before he had seen the Christ of the Lord. 
\v 27 And he came in the Spirit into the temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the law, 
\v 28 he took him in his arms, and blessed God, and said, 
\v 29 Lord! now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word; 
\v 30 for mine eyes have seen thy salvation, 
\v 31 which thou hast prepared before the face of all the peoples; 
\v 32 a light to enlighten the gentiles, and to be the glory of thy people Israel. 
\v 33 And his father and his mother marveled at what was spoken concerning him. 
\v 34 And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, Behold, this child is appointed for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign that will be spoken against;— 
\v 35 yea, a sword will pierce through thine own soul,—that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed. 
\v 36 And there was Anna, a prophetess, daughter of Phanuel: of the tribe of Asher; she was of great age, and had lived with a husband seven years from her virginity; 
\v 37 and she was a widow eighty-four years old, who never left the temple, worshipping with fastings and prayers night and day. 
\v 38 And she came up at this very time, and gave thanks to God, and spoke of him to all that were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem. 
\v 39 And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own city Nazareth. 
\v 40 And the child grew, and waxed strong, being filled with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon him. 
\v 41 Now his parents used to go yearly to Jerusalem at the feast of the passover. 
\v 42 And when he was twelve years old, and they went up, after the custom of the feast, 
\v 43 and had completed the days, on their returning, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and his parents did not know it, 
\v 44 but, supposing him to be in the company, went a day's journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance; 
\v 45 and not finding him, they returned to Jerusalem in search of him. 
\v 46 And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the teachers, both listening to them and asking them questions. 
\v 47 And all who heard him were astonished at his understanding and his answers. 
\v 48 And when they saw him, they were amazed; and his mother said to him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have been seeking thee in much distress. 
\v 49 And he said to them, Why is it that ye have been seeking me? Did ye not know that I must be about my Father's business? 
\v 50 And they understood not what he spoke to them. 
\v 51 And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them. And his mother kept all these things in her heart. 
\v 52 And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.

\v 1 Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene, 
\v 2 when Annas and Caiaphas were high-priests, the word of God came to John, the son of Zachariah, in the wilderness. 
\v 3 And he came into all the country about the Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins; 
\v 4 as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet: “The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight his paths! 
\v 5 Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be made low; and the crooked places shall be made straight, and the rough ways smooth; 
\v 6 and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.” 
\v 7 He said therefore to the multitudes that came forth to be baptized by him, Brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? 
\v 8 Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance; and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for our father; for I say to you, that God is able out of these stones to raise up children to Abraham. 
\v 9 And already also is the axe lying at the root of the trees; every tree therefore that beareth not good fruit is to be cut down, and cast into the fire. 
\v 10 And the multitudes asked him, saying, What then must we do? 
\v 11 He answered and said to them, He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath food, let him do likewise. 
\v 12 And there came also publicans to be baptized, and said to him, Teacher, what must we do? 
\v 13 And he said to them, Exact no more than hath been ordered you. 
\v 14 And soldiers also asked him, saying, And what must we do? And he said to them, Do violence to no one, accuse no one falsely, and be content with your wages. 
\v 15 And while the people were in expectation, and all were considering in their hearts concerning John, whether he were the Christ, 
\v 16 John answered and said to them all, I indeed baptize you with water; but he who is mightier than I is coming, the latchet of whose sandals I am not worthy to loose; he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and in fire. 
\v 17 His winnowing-shovel is in his hand to thoroughly cleanse his threshing-floor, and gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire. 
\v 18 And giving many other exhortations he published the glad tidings to the people. 
\v 19 But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him on account of Herodias the wife of his brother, and on account of all the evil deeds which Herod had done, 
\v 20 added this also to them all, that he shut up John in prison. 
\v 21 And it came to pass, when all the people had been baptized, and Jesus also had been baptized, and was praying, that the heaven was opened, 
\v 22 and the Holy Spirit descended upon him in a bodily shape as a dove; and a voice came from heaven: “Thou art my beloved Son; with thee I am well pleased.” 
\v 23 And Jesus himself was, when he began, about thirty years of age, being, as was supposed, the son of Joseph, who was the son of Heli, 
\v 24 who was the son of Matthath, who was the son of Levi, who was the son of Melchi, who was the son of Jannai, who was the son of Joseph, 
\v 25 who was the son of Mattathias, who was the son of Amos, who was the son of Nahum, who was the son of Esli, who was the son of Naggai, 
\v 26 who was the son of Maath, who was the son of Mattathias, who was the son of Shimei, who was the son of Josech, who was the son of Joda, 
\v 27 who was the son of Joanan, who was the son of Rhesa, who was the son of Zerubbabel, who was the son of Shealtiel, who was the son of Neri, 
\v 28 who was the son of Melchi, who was the son of Addi, who was the son of Kosam, who was the son of Elmadam, who was the son of Er, 
\v 29 who was the son of Jesus, who was the son of Eliezer, who was the son of Jorim, who was the son of Matthath, who was the son of Levi, 
\v 30 who was the son of Simeon, who was the son of Judah, who was the son of Joseph, who was the son of Jonam, who was the son of Eliakim, 
\v 31 who was the son of Melea, who was the son of Menna, who was the son of Mattatha, who was the son of Nathan, who was the son of David, 
\v 32 who was the son of Jesse, who was the son of Obed, who was the son of Boaz, who was the son of Salma, who was the son of Nahshon, 
\v 33 who was the son of Amminadab, who was the son of Admin, who was the son of Arni, who was the son of Hezron, who was the son of Pharez, who was the son of Judah, 
\v 34 who was the son of Jacob, who was the son of Isaac, who was the son of Abraham, who was the son of Terah, who was the son of Nahor, 
\v 35 who was the son of Serug, who was the son of Reu, who was the son of Peleg, who was the son of Eber, who was the son of Shelah, 
\v 36 who was the son of Cainan, who was the son of Arphaxad, who was the son of Shem, who was the son of Noah, who was the son of Lamech, 
\v 37 who was the son of Methuselah, who was the son of Enoch, who was the son of Jared, who was the son of Mahalaleel, who was the son of Cainan, 
\v 38 who was the son of Enos, who was the son of Seth, who was the son of Adam, who was the son of God.

\v 1 And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan, and was led in the Spirit in the wilderness 
\v 2 forty days, tempted by the Devil. And he ate nothing in those days; and when they were ended, he was hungry. 
\v 3 And the Devil said to him, If thou art the Son of God, command this stone that it become a loaf of bread. 
\v 4 And Jesus answered him, It is written, “Not on bread alone shall man live.” 
\v 5 And taking him up, he showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. 
\v 6 And the Devil said to him, All this power will I give thee, and their glory; because to me it hath been delivered, and I give it to whomever I will. 
\v 7 If thou then wilt worship me, it shall all be thine. 
\v 8 And Jesus answering said to him, It is written, “Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.” 
\v 9 And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down from hence; 
\v 10 for it is written, “He will give his angels charge concerning thee, to guard thee; 
\v 11 and in their hands they will bear thee up, that thou mayst not dash thy foot against a stone.” 
\v 12 And Jesus answering said to him, It hath been said, “Thou shalt not make trial of the Lord thy God.” 
\v 13 And when he had brought every temptation to an end, the Devil departed from him for a season. 
\v 14 And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee; and there went out a report concerning him through all the surrounding country 
\v 15 And he taught in their synagogues, honored by all. 
\v 16 And he came to Nazara, where he had been brought up, and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath-day; and stood up to read. 
\v 17 And there was delivered to him the book of the prophet Isaiah; and unrolling the book, he found the place where it was written, 
\v 18 “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he anointed me to preach glad tidings to the poor; he hath sent me to proclaim deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty the oppressed, 
\v 19 to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.” 
\v 20 And rolling up the book, he gave it back to the attendant, and sat down; and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed upon him. 
\v 21 And he began to say to them, To-day hath this scripture been fulfilled in your ears. 
\v 22 And they all spoke in his praise, and wondered at the words of grace which proceeded from his mouth; and they said, Is not this Joseph's son? 
\v 23 And he said to them, Ye will doubtless say to me this proverb, “Physician, heal thyself;” whatever things we have heard of as having been done in Capernaum, do here too in thy own country. 
\v 24 And he said, Truly do I say to you, No prophet is acceptable in his own country. 
\v 25 But I tell you in truth, that there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, and there was a great famine throughout all the land; 
\v 26 and yet to none of them was Elijah sent, but to Sarepta in Sidonia, to a woman that was a widow. 
\v 27 And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet; and not one of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian. 
\v 28 And all in the synagogue, when they heard this, were filled with wrath. 
\v 29 And they rose up, and forced him out of the city and took him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built, to cast him down headlong; 
\v 30 but he, passing through the midst of them, went away. 
\v 31 And he came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and was teaching them on the sabbath. 
\v 32 And they were astonished at his teaching; for his word was with authority. 
\v 33 And in the synagogue there was a man having a spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice, 
\v 34 Ha! what have we to do with thee, Jesus of Nazareth? Thou hast come to destroy us. I know who thou art, the Holy One of God. 
\v 35 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be silent, and come out of him. And the demon threw him down in the midst, and came out of him, having done him no hurt. 
\v 36 And all were amazed; and they spoke with one another, saying, What kind of word is this, that with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out? 
\v 37 And there went out a report concerning him into every place of the surrounding country. 
\v 38 And he arose and went from the synagogue into the house of Simon. And Simon's wife's mother was seized with a great fever; and they besought him for her. 
\v 39 And standing over her, he rebuked the fever, and it left her. And immediately she arose and waited on them. 
\v 40 And when the sun was setting, all who had any sick with divers diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them. 
\v 41 And demons also came out from many, crying out, and saying, Thou art the Son of God. And he rebuked them, and did not suffer them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ. 
\v 42 And when it was day, he went out, and betook himself to a desert place; and the multitudes went in search of him; and they came to him, and would have prevented him from leaving them. 
\v 43 But he said to them, I must publish the good tidings of the kingdom of God to the other cities also; because for this I was sent forth. 
\v 44 And he continued to preach in the synagogues of Galilee. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass, as the multitude was pressing upon him and hearing the word of God, that he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret, 
\v 2 and saw two boats standing by the lake; but the fishermen had gone out of them, and had washed the nets. 
\v 3 And going into one of the boats, which was Simon's, he asked him to put out a little from the land. And sitting down in the boat, he taught the multitudes. 
\v 4 And when he had done speaking, he said to Simon, Put out into deep water, and let down your nets for a draught. 
\v 5 And Simon answering said, Master, we toiled all night, and took nothing; but at thy word I will let down the nets. 
\v 6 And having done this, they inclosed great multitude of fishes; and their nets began to break. 
\v 7 And they beckoned to their partners in the other boat, to come and help them; and they came, and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink. 
\v 8 And Simon Peter seeing it fell down at the knees of Jesus, saying, Depart from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man. 
\v 9 For he and all that were with him were amazed at the draught of fishes, which they had taken; 
\v 10 and so were also James and John the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon And Jesus said to Simon, Fear not; henceforth thou shalt catch men. 
\v 11 And when they had brought their boats to land, they left everything, and followed him. 
\v 12 And it came to pass, when he was in one of the cities, lo! a man full of leprosy; and seeing Jesus, he fell on his face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst cleanse me. 
\v 13 And he put forth his hand and touched him, saying, I will; be thou cleansed. And immediately the leprosy left him. 
\v 14 And he charged him to tell no one: but go, and show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing as Moses commanded, for a testimony to them. 
\v 15 But so much the more went abroad the report concerning him; and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed of their infirmities. 
\v 16 But he was wont to withdraw to desert places, and pray. 
\v 17 And it came to pass on a certain day, that he was teaching, and there were sitting by Pharisees and teachers of the law, who had come from every town of Galilee and Judea, and from Jerusalem; and the power of the Lord was present that he might heal. 
\v 18 And lo! men brought on a bed a man that was palsied; and they endeavored to bring him in, and to set him before him. 
\v 19 And not finding any way to bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the house-top, and let him down through the tiling with the couch into the midst before Jesus. 
\v 20 And seeing their faith, he said, Man, thy sins have been forgiven thee. 
\v 21 And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this that speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone? 
\v 22 But Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, answered and said to them, What are ye thinking in your hearts? 
\v 23 Which is easier? to say, Thy sins have been forgiven thee? or to say, Arise, and walk? 
\v 24 But that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins,—he said to the palsied man,—I say to thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go to thy house. 
\v 25 And he immediately rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and went away to his house, giving glory to God. 
\v 26 And amazement seized them all, and they gave glory to God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to-day. 
\v 27 And after these things he went out, and saw a publican named Levi, sitting at the custom-house; and he said to him, Follow me. 
\v 28 And leaving everything, he arose and followed him. 
\v 29 And Levi made a great feast for him at his house, and there was a great company of publicans and others, who were reclining at table with them. 
\v 30 And the Pharisees and their scribes murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with the publicans and sinners? 
\v 31 And Jesus answering said to them, They who are well do not need a physician, but they who are sick. 
\v 32 I have not come to call righteous men, but sinners to repentance. 
\v 33 And they said to him, The disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise those of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink. 
\v 34 But Jesus said to them, Can ye make the companions of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? 
\v 35 But the days will come—and when the bridegroom is taken from them, then will they fast in those days. 
\v 36 And he spoke also a parable to them: No one taketh a patch from a new garment and putteth it upon an old one; for then both the new garment would be rent, and the patch from the new garment would not match with the old. 
\v 37 And no one putteth new wine into old skins; for the new wine would burst the skins, and would itself run out, and the skins would be spoilt. 
\v 38 But new wine must be put into new skins. 
\v 39 And no one, having drunk old wine, desireth new; for he saith, The old is good.

\p
\v 1 And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he was going through grain-fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of grain, and ate them, rubbing them with their hands. 
\v 2 And some of the Pharisees said, Why are ye doing that which it is not lawful to do on the sabbath? 
\v 3 And Jesus answering them, said, Have ye not even read what David did, when he was himself hungry, and they who were with him? 
\v 4 how he went into the house of God, and took and ate the show-bread, and gave it also to those who were with him, which it is not lawful for any to eat but the priests alone? 
\v 5 And he said to them, The Son of man is lord even of the sabbath. 
\v 6 And it came to pass on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue, and taught; and there was a man there whose right hand was withered. 
\v 7 And the scribes and the Pharisees were watching whether he would heal on the sabbath, that they might find an accusation against him. 
\v 8 But he knew their thoughts; and he said to the man having the withered hand, Rise, and stand up in the midst. And he arose, and stood up. 
\v 9 And Jesus said to them, I ask you whether it is lawful on the sabbath to do good, or to do evil; to save life, or to kill? 
\v 10 And looking round on them all, he said to him, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so; and his hand was restored. 
\v 11 But they were filled with madness, and conferred with one another as to what they should do to Jesus. 
\v 12 And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into the mountain to pray; and he continued all night in prayer to God. 
\v 13 And when it was day, he called to him his disciples; and he chose from them twelve, whom he also named apostles; 
\v 14 Simon, whom he named Peter, and Andrew his brother, and James and John, and Philip and Bartholomew, 
\v 15 and Matthew and Thomas, and James the Son of Alphaeus, and Simon called the zealot, 
\v 16 and Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor. 
\v 17 And he came down with them, and stood on a level place with a great multitude of his disciples, and a great crowd of the people from all Judaea and Jerusalem and the sea-coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases. 
\v 18 And they that were harassed with unclean spirits were cured. 
\v 19 And the whole multitude sought to touch him, because power went out of him and healed all. 
\v 20 And raising his eyes toward his disciples, he said, Blessed are ye poor; for yours is the kingdom of God. 
\v 21 Blessed are ye that hunger now; for ye will be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now; for ye will laugh. 
\v 22 Blessed are ye when men hate you, and when they exclude you, and revile and cast out your name as evil, on account of the Son of man. 
\v 23 Rejoice in that day, and leap for joy; for lo! your reward is great in heaven; for thus their fathers did to the prophets. 
\v 24 But woe to you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation. 
\v 25 Woe to you that are full now! for ye will hunger. Woe to you that laugh now! for ye will mourn and weep. 
\v 26 Woe, when all men speak well of you! for so did their fathers of the false prophets. 
\v 27 But I say to you who hear: Love your enemies; do good to those who hate you; 
\v 28 bless those who curse you; pray for those who are spiteful to you. 
\v 29 To him that smiteth thee on one cheek, offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloak, forbid not to take thy coat also. 
\v 30 Give to every one that asketh of thee; and from him that taketh away thy goods, demand them not again. 
\v 31 And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also in like manner to them. 
\v 32 And if ye love those who love you, what thanks do ye deserve? for sinners also love those who love them. 
\v 33 For if ye do good to those who do good to you, what thanks do ye deserve? even sinners do the same. 
\v 34 And if ye lend to those from whom ye expect to receive, what thanks do ye deserve? even sinners lend to sinners, to receive as much in return. 
\v 35 But love your enemies, and do good and lend, despairing of no one; and your reward will be great, and ye will be sons of the Most High; for he is kind to the unthankful and wicked. 
\v 36 Be merciful, as your Father is merciful. 
\v 37 And judge not, and ye will not be judged; and condemn not, and ye will not be condemned; forgive, and ye will be forgiven; 
\v 38 give, and it will be given to you; good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, will men give into your bosom; for with what measure ye mete, it will be measured to you in return. 
\v 39 And he spoke also a parable to them: Can the blind lead the blind? Will they not both fall into a ditch? 
\v 40 A disciple is not above his teacher; but every one when fully instructed will be as his teacher. 
\v 41 And why dost thou look at the mote in thy brother's eye, and not perceive the beam that is in thine own eye? 
\v 42 How canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me take out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself perceivest not the beam in thine own eye? Hypocrite! first cast the beam out of thine own eye, and then thou wilt see clearly to take out the mote that is in thy brother's eye. 
\v 43 For there is no good tree that beareth bad fruit; and again, there is no bad tree that beareth good fruit. 
\v 44 For every tree is known by its own fruit; for from thorns men do not gather figs, nor from a bramble-bush do they gather grapes. 
\v 45 The good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and the evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth that which is evil; for out of the abundance of his heart his mouth speaketh. 
\v 46 But why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say? 
\v 47 Every one that cometh to me and heareth my sayings and doeth them, I will show you whom he is like. 
\v 48 He is like a man building a house, who dug deep, and laid its foundation on a rock; and when a flood arose, the stream dashed against that house, and could not shake it; because it was well built. 
\v 49 But he that heareth and doeth not, is like a man that built a house upon the earth without a foundation; against which the stream dashed, and it fell at once, and the ruin of that house was great. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1 When he had ended all his discourse in the hearing of the people, he entered Capernaum. 
\v 2 And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear to him, was sick, and about to die. 
\v 3 And having heard about Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, and besought him to come and save his servant. 
\v 4 And they came to Jesus, and besought him earnestly, saying, He is worthy that thou shouldst do this for him; 
\v 5 for he loveth our nation, and himself built the synagogue for us. 
\v 6 And Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends, saying, Lord, trouble not thyself; for I am not worthy that thou shouldst come under my roof; 
\v 7 on which account I did not think myself worthy to come to thee; but command with a word, and let my servant be healed. 
\v 8 For even I am a man set under authority, having soldiers under me; and I say to this one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it. 
\v 9 And Jesus hearing this, wondered at him; and turning round said to the multitude that followed him, I say to you, Not even in Israel have I found such faith. 
\v 10 And they who were sent, returning to the house, found the servant well. 
\v 11 And it came to pass the day after, that he was going to a city called Nain; and many of his disciples were with him, and a great multitude. 
\v 12 And as he came near the gate of the city, lo! there was carried out dead an only son of his mother, and she was a widow; and a great multitude from the city was with her. 
\v 13 And when the Lord saw her, he was moved with compassion for her, and said to her, Weep not. 
\v 14 And he came up, and touched the bier; and they who bore it stood still; and he said, Young man, I say to thee, Rise. 
\v 15 And he that was dead sat up and began to speak; and he gave him to his mother. 
\v 16 And fear seized on all, and they gave glory to God, saying, A great prophet hath risen up among us; and, God hath visited his people. 
\v 17 And this report about him went forth in all Judaea, and in all the neighboring country. 
\v 18 And the disciples of John told him all these things. 
\v 19 And calling to him two of his disciples, John sent them to the Lord, saying, Art thou he that is to come, or are we to look for another? 
\v 20 And the men came to him and said, John the Baptist hath sent us to thee, saying, Art thou he that is to come, or are we to look for another? 
\v 21 In that hour he cured many of diseases, and plagues, and evil spirits, and to many who were blind he gave sight. 
\v 22 And he answered and said to them, Go and tell John what ye have seen and heard; that the blind receive sight, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor good tidings are brought; 
\v 23 and blessed is he, whoever shall find no occasion of stumbling in me. 
\v 24 And when the messengers of John had departed, he began to say to the multitudes concerning John, What have ye gone out into the wilderness to see? the reeds shaken by the wind? 
\v 25 But what have ye gone out to see? a man clothed in soft raiment? Lo! they who wear gorgeous apparel, and live luxuriously, are in kings' palaces. 
\v 26 But what have ye gone out to see? A prophet? Yea, I say to you, and more than a prophet. 
\v 27 This is he of whom it is written, “Lo! I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.” 
\v 28 I say to you, Among those born of women there is no greater prophet than John; but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he. 
\v 29 And all the people when they heard him, and the publicans, acknowledged God as righteous by being baptized with the baptism of John. 
\v 30 But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the purpose of God toward themselves, not being baptized by him. 
\v 31 To what then shall I compare the men of this generation, and what are they like? 
\v 32 They are like children sitting in the market-place, and calling one to another, saying, We piped to you, and ye did not dance; we sung a dirge, and ye did not weep. 
\v 33 For John the Baptist hath come not eating bread, nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a demon. 
\v 34 The Son of man hath come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold, a glutton and a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and sinners! 
\v 35 But wisdom is acknowledged by all her children. 
\v 36 And one of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him; and he went into the Pharisee's house, and reclined at the table. 
\v 37 And lo! a woman who was in the city, a sinner, learning that he was at table in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster-bottle of ointment, 
\v 38 and standing behind at his feet, weeping, began to wet his feet with tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment. 
\v 39 And the Pharisee who had invited him, when he saw this, said within himself, This man, if he were a prophet, would know who, and what sort of woman, this is that toucheth him; for she is a sinner. 
\v 40 And Jesus answering said to him, Simon, I have somewhat to say to thee. And he saith, Teacher, say on. 
\v 41 A certain money-lender had two debtors; one owed five hundred denaries, and the other fifty. 
\v 42 When they had nothing to pay, he freely remitted the debt of both. Which of them, now, will love him the most? 
\v 43 Simon answering said, He, I suppose, to whom he remitted the most. And he said to him, Thou hast judged rightly. 
\v 44 And turning to the woman, he said to Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered thy house, no water didst thou give me for my feet; but she wet my feet with tears, and wiped them with her hair. 
\v 45 No kiss didst thou give me; but she, from the time I came in, did not cease to kiss my feet. 
\v 46 My head with oil thou didst not anoint; but she anointed my feet with costly ointment. 
\v 47 Wherefore, I say to thee, her many sins have been forgiven; for she loved much; but he to whom little is forgiven loveth little. 
\v 48 And he said to her, Thy sins have been forgiven. 
\v 49 And those who were at table with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that even forgiveth sins? 
\v 50 But he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass afterward, that he journeyed through cities and villages, preaching and publishing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God; and the twelve were with him, 
\v 2 and certain women who had been cured of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom had come seven demons, 
\v 3 and Joanna, the wife of Chuzas, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, who afforded them aid from their substance. 
\v 4 And a great multitude collecting together, and people from the cities going out to him, he spoke by a parable: 
\v 5 A sower went forth to sow his seed; and as he sowed, some seeds fell by the way-side; and they were trodden down, and the birds of the air devoured them. 
\v 6 And others fell upon rocky ground; and when they had sprung up they withered away, because they had no moisture. 
\v 7 And others fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up with them, and choked them. 
\v 8 And others fell upon good ground, and sprung up, and bore fruit, a hundred-fold. While saying these things, he cried aloud, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. 
\v 9 And his disciples asked him what this parable meant. 
\v 10 And he said, To you it hath been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God; but to others [[these things are spoken]] in parables; that while seeing they may not see, and while hearing they may not understand. 
\v 11 Now the meaning of the parable is this. The seed is the word of God. 
\v 12 Those by the way-side are they that hear; then cometh the Devil and taketh away the word from their heart, that they may not believe and be saved. 
\v 13 Those on the rocky ground are they who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root; and for a while they believe, and in time of temptation fall away. 
\v 14 And those seeds which fell among the thorns, these are they who, when they have heard, go away and are choked with the cares and riches and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to perfection. 
\v 15 But the seeds on the good ground, these are they who in an honest and good heart, when they have heard the word, hold it fast, and bear fruit with constancy. 
\v 16 And no one having lighted a lamp, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a lampstand, that those who come in may see the light. 
\v 17 For nothing is secret, that will not be made manifest; nor hidden, that will not be known, and come to light. 
\v 18 Take heed therefore how ye hear; for whoever hath, to him will be given; and whoever hath not, from him will be taken even what he seemeth to have. 
\v 19 And his mother and his brothers came where he was, and could not get to him on account of the crowd. 
\v 20 And word was brought to him, Thy mother and thy brothers stand without, desiring to see thee. 
\v 21 And he answering said to them, My mother and my brothers are these, who hear the word of God, and do it. 
\v 22 Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a boat with his disciples, and said to them, Let us go over to the other side of the lake; and they put off. 
\v 23 But as they were sailing, he fell asleep. And there came down a storm of wind on the lake, and they were filling with water, and were in jeopardy. 
\v 24 And they came and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we are perishing! And he rose, and rebuked the wind, and the surging of the water; and they ceased, and there was a calm. 
\v 25 And he said to them, Where is your faith? And they were afraid, and wondered, saying one to another, Who then is this, that he commandeth even the winds and the water, and they obey him? 
\v 26 And they sailed to the country of the Gergesenes, which is over against Galilee. 
\v 27 And when he had landed, there met him a certain man out of the city who had demons, and for a long time had worn no clothes, and abode not in a house, but in the tombs. 
\v 28 And seeing Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and said with a loud voice, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, Son of the most high God? I beseech thee, do not torment me. 
\v 29 For he was about to command the unclean spirit to come out of the man; for it had possessed him for a long time, and he had been kept bound and secured with chains and fetters; and bursting the bands, he had been driven by the demon into the wilderness. 
\v 30 And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion; because many demons had entered into him. 
\v 31 And they besought him not to command them to go away into the abyss. 
\v 32 Now there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain; and they besought him to permit them to go into them. And he permitted them. 
\v 33 And the demons coming out of the man went into the swine; and the herd rushed down the steep into the lake, and were drowned. 
\v 34 And the herdsmen, seeing what was done, fled, and told the news in the city and in the country. 
\v 35 And they went out to see what had been done. And they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone out sitting, clothed, and in his right mind, at the feet of Jesus; and they were afraid. 
\v 36 And they who had seen it told them how he that was possessed by demons was made well. 
\v 37 And the whole multitude in the surrounding country of the Gergesenes besought him to depart from them; for they were seized with great fear. And he went on board a boat and returned. 
\v 38 And the man out of whom the demons had gone besought him that he might be with him. But he sent him away, saying, 
\v 39 Return to thy house, and tell what great things God hath done for thee. And he went and published through the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him. 
\v 40 And it came to pass when Jesus returned, that the multitude welcomed him; for they were all waiting for him. 
\v 41 And lo! there came a man, named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue; and falling at the feet of Jesus, he besought him to come into his house; 
\v 42 for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. And as he went, the multitudes thronged him. 
\v 43 And a woman who had had an issue of blood twelve years, and had spent all her living upon physicians, and could not be cured by any one, 
\v 44 came up behind and touched the fringe of his garment; and immediately her issue of blood ceased. 
\v 45 And Jesus said, Who touched me? And when all denied it, Peter and those with him said, Master, the multitudes are thronging thee, and pressing against thee. 
\v 46 But Jesus said, Some one touched me; for I perceived that power went out from me. 
\v 47 And the woman, seeing that she was discovered, came trembling, and falling down before him declared before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was cured immediately. 
\v 48 And he said to her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee well; go in peace. 
\v 49 While he was yet speaking, there cometh one from the house of the ruler of the synagogue, saying, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Teacher any further. 
\v 50 But Jesus hearing this, answered him, Fear not; only believe, and she will be made well. 
\v 51 And going into the house, he suffered no one to go in with him but Peter and John and James, and the father of the maiden, and the mother. 
\v 52 And all were weeping, and lamenting for her. But he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleeping. 
\v 53 And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead. 
\v 54 But he took hold of her hand, and called aloud, saying, Maiden, arise! 
\v 55 And her spirit returned, and she immediately arose. And he ordered food to be given to her. 
\v 56 And her parents were amazed. But he charged them to tell no one what had been done. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 And he called together the twelve, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases. 
\v 2 And he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God, and to heal. 
\v 3 And he said to them, Take nothing for the journey, neither a staff, nor a bag, nor bread, nor money, nor have two coats apiece. 
\v 4 And into whatever house ye enter, there abide, and from it take your departure. 
\v 5 And whoever shall not receive you, shake off, when ye leave that city, even the dust from your feet as a testimony against them. 
\v 6 And they departed, and went through the towns publishing the glad tidings, and performing cures everywhere. 
\v 7 And Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was taking place, and was perplexed; because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead; 
\v 8 and by some, that Elijah had appeared; and by others, that one of the old prophets had risen. 
\v 9 But Herod said, John I beheaded; but who is this, about whom I hear such things? And he sought to see him. 
\v 10 And the apostles returned and told him what they had done; and taking them with him, he withdrew privately to a city called Bethsaida. 
\v 11 But the multitudes, when they knew it, followed him; and he welcomed them, and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who had need of healing. 
\v 12 And when the day began to decline, the twelve came and said to him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages around, and the open country, and lodge, and get food; for we are here in a desert place. 
\v 13 But he said to them, Do ye give them food. And they said, We have not more than five loaves and two fishes, unless we ourselves should go and buy food for l all these people. 
\v 14 They were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them lie down in companies of fifty. 
\v 15 And they did so, and made them all lie down. 
\v 16 Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and broke and gave them to the disciples to set before the multitude. 
\v 17 And they ate, and were all filled; and what remained to them of fragments was taken up, twelve baskets. 
\v 18 And it came to pass as he was in a private place praying, that his disciples were with him; and he asked them, saying, Who do the multitudes say that I am? 
\v 19 And they answering said, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and others, that one of the old prophets hath risen. 
\v 20 And he said to them, But who do ye say that I am? And Peter answering said, The Christ of God. 
\v 21 But he strictly charged them, and commanded them to tell this to no one; 
\v 22 saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be put to death, and rise again on the third day. 
\v 23 And he said to all, If any one chooseth to come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily, and follow me. 
\v 24 For whoever chooseth to save his life, will lose it; and whoever loseth his life for my sake, he will save it. 
\v 25 For what is a man profited, if he gain the whole world, and lose or forfeit himself? 
\v 26 For whoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of man be ashamed, when be cometh in his glory, and that of his Father, and of the holy angels. 
\v 27 And I tell you in truth, that there are some of those standing here who will not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God. 
\v 28 And it came to pass about eight days after this discourse, that he took with him Peter and John and James, and went up into the mountain to pray. 
\v 29 And while he was praying, the appearance of his countenance was changed, and his raiment became white and glistening. 
\v 30 And lo! two men were talking with him, who were Moses and Elijah; 
\v 31 who appeared in glory, and spoke of his departure which he was about to fulfill in Jerusalem. 
\v 32 But Peter and those who were with him were weighed down with sleep. But when they awoke, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him. 
\v 33 And it came to pass as they were parting from him, that Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tents, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah;—not knowing what he said. 
\v 34 But as he was saying this, there came a cloud and overshadowed them; and they were afraid as they entered the cloud. 
\v 35 And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, “This is my chosen Son; hear him.” 
\v 36 And when the voice had come, Jesus was found alone. And they kept it secret, and told no one in those days anything of what they had seen. 
\v 37 And it came to pass that on the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great multitude met him. 
\v 38 And lo! a man from the multitude cried out, saying, Teacher, I beseech thee, look upon my son, for he is my only child; 
\v 39 and lo! a spirit seizeth him, and suddenly crieth out, and convulseth him so that he foameth, and it departeth from him hardly, taking away all his strength. 
\v 40 And I besought thy disciples to cast it out, and they could not. 
\v 41 And Jesus answering said, O unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and bear with you? Bring thy son hither. 
\v 42 And while he was yet coming, the demon threw him down, and convulsed him. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him to his father. 
\v 43 And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they were all wondering at all the things which he did, he said to his disciples, 
\v 44 As for you, let these words sink into your ears; for the Son of man is about to be delivered up into the hands of men. 
\v 45 But they knew not the meaning of these words, and it was hidden from them, that they might not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask him about these words. 
\v 46 And there arose a reasoning among them, which of them was greatest. 
\v 47 And Jesus knowing the reasoning of their heart, took a child and set him by his side, 
\v 48 and said to them, Whoever receiveth this child in my name, receiveth me; and whoever receiveth me, receiveth him who sent me. For he that is least among you all, he is great. 
\v 49 And John answering said, Master, we saw one casting out demons in thy name, and we forbade him, because he doth not follow in our company. 
\v 50 But Jesus said to him, Forbid him not; for he that is not against you is for you. 
\v 51 And it came to pass, when the time was near for his being received up, that he himself steadily set his face to go to Jerusalem. 
\v 52 And he sent messengers before him; and they went and entered a city of the Samaritans, to make ready for him. 
\v 53 And they did not receive him, because his face was as if he were going to Jerusalem. 
\v 54 And the disciples James and John, on seeing it, said, Lord, wilt thou have us bid fire come down from heaven, and consume them? 
\v 55 But he turned and rebuked them. 
\v 56 And they went to another village. 
\v 57 And as they were traveling on the way, one said to him, I will follow thee wherever thou goest. 
\v 58 And Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have lodging-places; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head. 
\v 59 And he said to another, Follow me. But he said, Suffer me first to go and bury my father. 
\v 60 And he said to him, Let the dead bury their own dead; but go thou and carry the tidings of the kingdom of God. 
\v 61 And another also said, I will follow thee, Lord; but first let me bid farewell to those who are in my house. 
\v 62 And Jesus said to him, No one who looketh back after putting his hand to the plough is fit for the kingdom of God. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1 After these things, the Lord appointed also seventy others, and sent them two and two before him into every city and place where he himself was about to come. 
\v 2 And he said to them, The harvest is great, but the laborers are few. Pray therefore the Lord of the harvest to send forth laborers for his harvest. 
\v 3 Go forth; lo! I send you as lambs into the midst of wolves. 
\v 4 Carry no purse, no bag, no sandals; salute no one by the way. 
\v 5 And into whatever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house. 
\v 6 And if a son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it; if not, it shall return to you. 
\v 7 And abide in the same house, eating and drinking such things as they give; for the laborer is worthy of his wages. Do not go from house to house. 
\v 8 And into whatever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat what is set before you, 
\v 9 and heal the sick that are therein, and say to them, The kingdom of God hath come near to you. 
\v 10 But into whatever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go out into its streets and say, 
\v 11 Even the dust of your city that cleaveth to our feet we wipe off to you; but know this, that the kingdom of God hath come near. 
\v 12 And I tell you, that it will be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city. 
\v 13 Woe to thee, Chorazin! woe to thee, Bethsaida! for if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would long ago have repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. 
\v 14 But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment, than for you. 
\v 15 And thou, Capernaum! shalt thou be exalted to heaven? thou shalt be brought down to the underworld. 
\v 16 He that hearkeneth to you, hearkeneth to me; and he that rejecteth you, rejecteth me; but he that rejecteth me, rejecteth him that sent me. 
\v 17 And the seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject to us in thy name. 
\v 18 And he said to them, I saw Satan fall from heaven like lightning. 
\v 19 Lo! I have given you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the might of the enemy; and nothing shall by any means hurt you. 
\v 20 Yet rejoice not in this, that the spirits are subject to you; but rejoice that your names have been written in heaven. 
\v 21 In that hour he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that, though thou didst hide these things from the wise and discerning, thou didst reveal them to babes. Yea, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight. And turning to the disciples he said, 
\v 22 All things were delivered to me by my Father; and no one knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and he to whom it is the will of the Son to reveal him. 
\v 23 And turning to the disciples, he said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye are seeing. 
\v 24 For I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see the things which ye are seeing, and saw them not; and to hear the things which ye are hearing, and heard them not. 
\v 25 And lo! a certain lawyer stood up to try him, saying, Teacher, what shall I do to inherit everlasting life? 
\v 26 And he said to him, What is written in the Law? How readest thou? 
\v 27 And he answering said “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself.” 
\v 28 And he said to him, Thou hast answered rightly; do this, and thou shalt live. 
\v 29 But he, wishing to justify himself, said to Jesus, And who is my neighbor? 
\v 30 Jesus answering said, A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among robbers; who after stripping him of his raiment, and wounding him, departed, leaving him half dead. 
\v 31 And by chance a certain priest was going down on that road; and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. 
\v 32 And in like manner also a Levite, having arrived at the place, came and saw, and passed by on the other side. 
\v 33 But a certain Samaritan, as he was journeying, came where he was, and when he saw him, had compassion, 
\v 34 and went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine, and setting him on his own beast, brought him to an inn, and took care of him. 
\v 35 And the next day, he took out two denaries and gave them to the host, and said, Take care of him; and whatever thou spendest more, I, when I come back, will repay thee. 
\v 36 Which of these three, dost thou think, was neighbor to him that fell among the robbers? 
\v 37 And he said, He that took pity on him. Then said Jesus to him, Go, and do thou likewise. 
\v 38 And it came to pass, as they journeyed, that he entered into a certain village; and a certain woman, named Martha, received him into her house. 
\v 39 And she had a sister called Mary, who sat down at the feet of the Lord, and listened to his word. 
\v 40 But Martha was cumbered about much serving; and she came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? Tell her therefore to help me. 
\v 41 But the Lord answering said to her, Martha, Martha, thou art anxious and troubled about many things. 
\v 42 But one thing is needful. For Mary hath chosen the good part, which shall not be taken away from her. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass, as he was in a certain place praying, that when he ceased one of his disciples said to him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples. 
\v 2 And he said to them, When ye pray, say, Father, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come; 
\v 3 give us day by day our daily bread; 
\v 4 and forgive us our sins, for even we ourselves forgive every one that is indebted to us; and lead us not into temptation. 
\v 5 And he said to them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go to him at midnight, and say to him Friend, lend me three loaves; 
\v 6 for a friend of mine hath come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him? 
\v 7 And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not; the door is now shut, and I and my children are in bed; I cannot rise and give thee. 
\v 8 I say to you, though he will not rise and give him because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth. 
\v 9 And I say to you, Ask, and it will be given you; seek, and ye will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you. 
\v 10 For every one that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, the door will be opened. 
\v 11 And what father is there, among you, who, if his son ask for bread, will give him a stone? or if he ask for a fish, will instead of a fish give him a serpent? 
\v 12 or, if he ask for an egg, will give him a scorpion? 
\v 13 If ye then, though evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him! 
\v 14 And he was casting out a demon, and it was dumb; and it came to pass, when the demon had gone out, that the dumb man spoke. And the multitudes wondered. 
\v 15 But some of them said, He casteth out the demons through Beelzebul, the prince of the demons; 
\v 16 and others, to make trial of him, asked of him a sign from heaven. 
\v 17 But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and house divided against house falleth. 
\v 18 And if Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? For ye say that I cast out the demons through Beelzebul. 
\v 19 But if I cast out the demons through Beelzebul, through whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore shall they be judges of you. 
\v 20 But if I cast out the demons through the finger of God, then hath the kingdom of God already come to you. 
\v 21 When a strong man armed guardeth his palace, his goods are in peace; 
\v 22 but when one stronger than he cometh upon him and overcometh him, he taketh from him his whole armor wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils. 
\v 23 He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad. 
\v 24 When the unclean spirit is gone out from a man, it goeth through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, it saith, I will return to my house whence I came out. 
\v 25 And on coming, it findeth it swept and put in order. 
\v 26 Then it goeth, and taketh with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they enter in, and dwell there; and the last state of that man becometh worse than the first. 
\v 27 And it came to pass, as he was saying these things, that a certain woman lifted up her voice from the crowd, and said to him, Blessed is the womb that bore thee, and the breasts from which thou drewest nourishment. 
\v 28 But he said, Blessed rather are they that hear the word of God and keep it. 
\v 29 And when the crowds were thronging about him, he began to say, This generation is a wicked generation; it seeketh a sign; and no sign will be given it, but the sign of Jonah. 
\v 30 For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so will also the Son of man be to this generation. 
\v 31 The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and will condemn them; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and lo! something more than Solomon is here. 
\v 32 The men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and lo! something more than Jonah is here. 
\v 33 No one when he has lighted a lamp, puts it into a secret place, or under the bushel, but on the lamp-stand, that they who come in may see the light. 
\v 34 The lamp of the body is thine eye. When thine eye is clear, thy whole body also is in the light; but when it is disordered, thy body also is in darkness. 
\v 35 Take heed therefore, that the light which is within thee be not darkness. 
\v 36 If then thy whole body is enlightened, having no part dark, the whole will be as fully enlightened, as when a lamp with its bright shining giveth thee light. 
\v 37 And when he had done speaking, a Pharisee asked him to dine with him. And he went in and reclined at the table. 
\v 38 And the Pharisee, seeing it, wondered that he did not bathe before dinner. 
\v 39 But the Lord said to him, Now ye Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inside is full of rapacity and wickedness. 
\v 40 Fools, did not he who made the outside, make the inside also? 
\v 41 But give what they contain in alms, and lo! all is clean to you. 
\v 42 But woe to you Pharisees! for ye pay tithes of the mint, and the rue, and every herb; and pass by justice and the love of God. These ought ye to have done, and not to leave those undone. 
\v 43 Woe to you Pharisees! for ye love the chief seats in the synagogues, and salutations in the markets. 
\v 44 Woe to you, for ye are as tombs which are unseen, and men walking over them know it not. 
\v 45 And one of the lawyers answering saith to him, Teacher, in saying these things, thou revilest us also. 
\v 46 And he said, To you lawyers also, woe! for ye load men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers. 
\v 47 Woe to you! for ye build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them. 
\v 48 So then ye bear witness to and approve the deeds of your fathers; for they indeed killed them, and ye are building [[their tombs]]. 
\v 49 Therefore the wisdom of God also said, I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they will kill and persecute; 
\v 50 that the blood of all the prophets, which hath been shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation; 
\v 51 from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was slain between the altar and the temple. Yea, I tell you, it will be required of this generation. 
\v 52 Woe to you lawyers! because ye have taken away the key of knowledge; ye have not entered yourselves, and those who were entering ye have hindered. 
\v 53 And as he came out thence, the scribes and the Pharisees began to be very spiteful, and to press him to speak off hand about many things, 
\v 54 lying in wait to catch something out of his mouth. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 In the mean time, when the multitude was gathered together in myriads, so that they trod one upon another, he began to say to his disciples first, Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. 
\v 2 But there is nothing covered, that will not be revealed; and hid, that will not be known. 
\v 3 Therefore, whatever ye have said in darkness, will be heard in the light; and what ye have spoken in the ear in closets, will be proclaimed upon the house-tops. 
\v 4 And I say to you my friends, Fear not those who kill the body, and after this can do nothing more. 
\v 5 But I will warn you whom to fear; fear him who after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say to you, fear him. 
\v 6 Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? and not one of them is forgotten before God. 
\v 7 But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not: ye are of more value than many sparrows. 
\v 8 And I say to you, Every one that acknowledgeth me before men, him will the Son of man also acknowledge before the angels of God. 
\v 9 But he that hath denied me before men, shall be denied before the angels of God. 
\v 10 And every one that shall speak a word against the Son of man, it will be forgiven him; but to him that hath blasphemed against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven. 
\v 11 And when they bring you to the synagogues and the magistrates and the authorities, be not anxious as to how or what ye shall answer, or what ye shall say; 
\v 12 for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what ye ought to say. 
\v 13 And one from the multitude said to him, Teacher, bid my brother divide the inheritance with me. 
\v 14 But he said to him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you? 
\v 15 And he said to them, Take heed and beware of all covetousness; for even when one hath great abundance, his life doth not depend upon his possessions. 
\v 16 And he spoke a parable to them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully. 
\v 17 And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do? for I have not where to store my crops. 
\v 18 And he said, This will I do; I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I store all my crops and my goods; 
\v 19 and I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast many goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, be merry. 
\v 20 But God said to him, Fool! this night will thy soul he required of thee; and whose will those things be which thou hast laid up? 
\v 21 So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich towards God. 
\v 22 And he said to his disciples, Therefore I say to you, Be not anxious for the life, what ye shall eat; nor for the body, what ye shall put on. 
\v 23 The life is more than its food, and the body than its raiment. 
\v 24 Consider the ravens, that they neither sow nor reap; which have neither store-house, nor barn; and God feedeth them. Of how much greater value are ye than the birds! 
\v 25 And who of you can by anxious thought add a cubit to his life? 
\v 26 If then ye cannot do even that which is least, why are ye anxious about the rest? 
\v 27 Consider the lilies, that they neither spin nor weave; and yet I say to you, Not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed like one of these. 
\v 28 But if God so clothes the herbage in the field, which is to-day, and tomorrow is cast into an oven, how much more will he clothe you, O ye of little faith! 
\v 29 And seek not ye what ye shall eat, and what ye shall drink; and be not of a doubtful mind. 
\v 30 For all these things do the nations of the world seek after; and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things. 
\v 31 But rather seek his kingdom, and these things will also be given you. 
\v 32 Fear not, little flock! for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom. 
\v 33 Sell what ye have, and give alms. Make for yourselves purses which wax not old, treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, nor moth destroyeth. 
\v 34 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. 
\v 35 Let your loins be girded about, and your lamps burning; 
\v 36 and be yourselves like men waiting for the return of their lord from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open to him immediately. 
\v 37 Happy are those servants, whom their lord when he cometh shall find watching; truly do I say to you, that he will gird himself, and place them at table, and will come and wait on them. 
\v 38 And if in the second, or if in the third watch, he cometh and findeth them thus, happy are they. 
\v 39 And be sure of this, that if the master of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have suffered his house to be broken through. 
\v 40 Be ye also ready; for at an hour when ye think not the Son of man cometh. 
\v 41 And Peter said to him, Lord, dost thou speak this parable to us, or also to all? 
\v 42 And the Lord said, Who then is the faithful, the wise steward, whom his lord will place over his household, to give the portion of food in due season? 
\v 43 Happy is that servant whom his lord, when he cometh, shall find so doing. 
\v 44 I say to you in truth, that he will place him in charge of all his substance. 
\v 45 But if that servant say in his heart, My lord is long in coming; and begin to beat the men-servants and maid-servants, and to eat and drink and be drunken, 
\v 46 the lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the unfaithful. 
\v 47 And that servant who knew his lord's will, and did not make ready, nor do according to his will, will be beaten with many stripes; 
\v 48 but he that knew not and did things worthy of stripes, will be beaten with few. And from every one to whom much hath been given, will much be required; and to whom much hath been entrusted, of him will the more be demanded. 
\v 49 I came to cast fire upon the earth; and what do I wish, if it hath been already kindled? 
\v 50 But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how is my soul troubled, till it be accomplished! 
\v 51 Think ye that I came to give peace in the earth? I tell you, nay, but rather division. 
\v 52 For from this time forth five in one house will be divided, three against two, and two against three. 
\v 53 They will be divided, father against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against mother; the mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. 
\v 54 And he said also to the multitudes, When ye see a cloud rising in the west, ye say at once, A shower is coming; and it is so; 
\v 55 and when ye perceive the south wind blowing, ye say, It will be hot; and it cometh to pass. 
\v 56 Hypocrites! ye know how to judge of the face of the earth and the sky; but how is it that ye know not how to judge of this time 
\v 57 And why even of yourselves do ye not judge what is right? 
\v 58 When thou art going with thine adversary at law to the magistrate, take pains, while on the way, to be released by him; lest he drag thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee into prison. 
\v 59 I tell thee, Thou wilt not come out thence, till thou hast paid the very last mite. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 There were present also at the same time some who told him of the Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate mingled with their sacrifices. 
\v 2 And he answering said to them, Do ye think that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they have suffered such things? 
\v 3 I tell you, nay; but unless ye repent, ye will all in like manner perish. 
\v 4 Or those eighteen, on whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think ye that they were offenders above all the men that dwell in Jerusalem? 
\v 5 I tell you, nay; but unless ye repent, ye will all in like manner perish. 
\v 6 He spoke also this parable: A certain man had a fig-tree planted in his vineyard; and he came seeking fruit thereon, and found none. 
\v 7 Then said he to the vine-dresser, Lo! three years I have come seeking fruit on this fig-tree, and have found none; cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground? 
\v 8 And he answering saith to him, Lord, let it alone this year also; till I shall dig about it, and dung it; 
\v 9 and if it bear fruit hereafter, well; but if not, thou shalt cut it down. 
\v 10 And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath. 
\v 11 And lo! there was a woman who had had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years; and she was bent together, and wholly unable to lift herself up. 
\v 12 And Jesus, seeing her, called to her, and said to her, Woman, thou art set free from thy infirmity. 
\v 13 And he laid his hands on her; and immediately she stood upright, and gave glory to God. 
\v 14 But the ruler of the synagogue answering, being filled with indignation because Jesus had performed a cure on the sabbath, said to the multitude, There are six days in which it is proper to work; on those therefore come and be cured, and not on the sabbath-day. 
\v 15 But the Lord answered him and said, Hypocrites, doth not each of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead him away and water him? 
\v 16 And ought not this woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo! for eighteen years, to be loosed from this bond on the sabbath-day? 
\v 17 And on his speaking thus, all his adversaries were ashamed; and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him. 
\v 18 He said therefore, To what is the kingdom of God like? and to what shall I compare it? 
\v 19 It is like a grain of mustard, which a man took, and cast into his garden; and it grew, and became a tree, and the birds of the air lodged in its branches. 
\v 20 And again he said, To what shall I liken the kingdom of God? 
\v 21 It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened. 
\v 22 And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and journeying towards Jerusalem. 
\v 23 And one said to him, Lord, are there few that are to be saved? And he said to them, 
\v 24 Strive to enter in through the narrow door; for many, I say to you, will seek to enter in, and will not be able. 
\v 25 When once the master of the house shall have risen, and shut the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, open to us, and he answering shall say to you, I know not whence ye are; 
\v 26 then will ye begin to say, We ate and drank in thy presence, and thou didst teach in our streets. 
\v 27 And he will say, I tell you, I know not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity. 
\v 28 There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth there, when ye see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and yourselves thrust out. 
\v 29 And from the east and the west and the north and the south will men come, and take their places at table in the kingdom of God. 
\v 30 And lo! there are last who will be first, and there are first who will be last. 
\v 31 In the same hour there came certain Pharisees, saying to him, Depart, and go hence; for Herod designeth to kill thee. 
\v 32 And he said to them, Go, tell that fox, Lo! I cast out demons and perform cures to-day and to-morrow, and on the third day I make an end. 
\v 33 But to-day and to-morrow and the next day I must go on; for it cannot be that a prophet should perish out of Jerusalem. 
\v 34 Jerusalem! Jerusalem! that killeth the prophets, and stoneth those who are sent to her! How often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen gathereth her brood under her wings, and ye would not! 
\v 35 Lo! your house is abandoned to you. I declare to you, Ye will not see me until the time come when ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass, when he had come into the house of one of the chief men of the Pharisees on the sabbath to eat bread, that they were watching him. 
\v 2 And lo! there was a certain man before him, who had the dropsy. 
\v 3 And Jesus answering spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to cure on the sabbath, or not? 
\v 4 But they were silent. And taking hold of him, he cured him, and sent him away. 
\v 5 And he answered them and said, Who is there of you, who, if his son or his ox fall into a pit, will not immediately pull him out on the sabbath-day? 
\v 6 And they could make no answer to this. 
\v 7 And he spoke a parable to those who were invited, when he observed how they chose out the highest places at the table, saying to them, 
\v 8 When thou art invited by any one to a wedding, do not take the highest place, lest one more honorable than thou may have been invited by him; 
\v 9 and he who invited thee and him come and say to thee, Give place to this man; and then thou wilt begin with shame to take the lowest place. 
\v 10 But when thou art invited, go and recline in the lowest place, that when he who invited thee cometh, he may say to thee, Friend, go up higher. Then wilt thou have honor in the presence of all who are at table with thee. 
\v 11 For every one that exalteth himself will be humbled; and he that humbleth himself will be exalted. 
\v 12 And he said also to him who invited him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, do not invite thy friends, nor thy brothers, nor thy kinsmen, nor rich neighbors; lest they too invite thee in return, and a recompense be made thee. 
\v 13 But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind; 
\v 14 and thou shalt be blessed, because they cannot recompense thee; but thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the righteous. 
\v 15 And one of those who were at table with him, hearing this, said to him, Blessed is he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God. 
\v 16 And he said to him, A certain man made a great supper, and invited many. 
\v 17 And at the hour of supper he sent his servant to say to those who had been invited, Come, for things are now ready. 
\v 18 And all with one accord began to excuse themselves. The first said to him, I have bought a piece of land, and must needs go out and see it; I pray that I may be excused. 
\v 19 And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and am going out to try them; I pray that I may be excused. 
\v 20 And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come. 
\v 21 And the servant came, and reported these things to his lord. Then the master of the house, being angry, said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, the blind, and the lame. 
\v 22 And the servant said, Lord, what thou didst command hath been done, and yet there is room. 
\v 23 And the lord said to the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and constrain them to come in, that my house may be filled. 
\v 24 For I say to you, that none of those men who were invited shall taste of my supper. 
\v 25 And great multitudes were going with him; and he turned and said to them, 
\v 26 If any one cometh to me, and hateth not his father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple. 
\v 27 Whoever doth not bear his own cross and follow me, cannot be my disciple. 
\v 28 For which of you, intending to build a tower, doth not sit down first and count the cost, whether he hath the means to finish it? 
\v 29 lest haply when he hath laid a foundation, and is not able to finish, all that behold begin to make sport of him, 
\v 30 saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish. 
\v 31 Or what king, setting out to give battle to another king, will not first sit down and consider whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand? 
\v 32 Else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an embassy, and asketh conditions of peace. 
\v 33 So likewise, whoever of you doth not forsake all that he hath, cannot be my disciple. 
\v 34 Salt then is good; but if the salt itself have lost its savor, wherewith shall it be seasoned? 
\v 35 It is fit neither for the land, nor for the dunghill; men cast it out. He that hath ears, let him hear. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1 And all the publicans and the sinners were drawing near to him, to hear him. 
\v 2 And the Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them. 
\v 3 And he spoke to them this parable, saying, 
\v 4 What man of you having a hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he findeth it? 
\v 5 And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing. 
\v 6 And when he hath come home, he calleth together his friends and neighbors, saying to them, Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost. 
\v 7 I say to you, that in like manner there will be joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety-nine righteous men who have no need of repentance. 
\v 8 Or what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, doth not light a lamp, and sweep the house, and search carefully till she findeth it? 
\v 9 And when she hath found it, she calleth together her friends and neighbors, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the piece which I lost. 
\v 10 I say to you, that thus there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth. 
\v 11 He said also, A certain man had two sons. 
\v 12 And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of the property that falleth to me. And he divided to them his living. 
\v 13 And not many days after, the younger son gathered all together, and went abroad into a far country; and there wasted his substance in riotous living. 
\v 14 And when he had spent all, there arose a great famine in that country; and he began to be in want. 
\v 15 And he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine. 
\v 16 And he longed to fill himself with the husks that the swine ate; and no one gave to him. 
\v 17 And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish here with hunger! 
\v 18 I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against Heaven and before thee; 
\v 19 I am no longer worthy to be called thy son; make me as one of thy hired servants. 
\v 20 And he arose, and went to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and ran and fell on his neck, and kissed him. 
\v 21 And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against Heaven and before thee; I am no longer worthy to be called thy son. 
\v 22 But the father said to his servants, Bring out the best robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and sandals on his feet. 
\v 23 And bring the fatted calf; kill it, and let us eat and make merry. 
\v 24 For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to make merry. 
\v 25 Now his elder son was in the field; and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing. 
\v 26 And calling one of the servants, he inquired what these things meant. 
\v 27 And he said to him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound. 
\v 28 But he was angry, and would not go in; and his father came out, and entreated him. 
\v 29 And he answering said to his father, Lo! for so many years have I served thee, and never transgressed thy command; and yet to me thou never gavest a kid, that I might make merry with my friends. 
\v 30 But as soon as this thy son came, who devoured thy living with harlots, thou didst kill for him the fatted calf. 
\v 31 And he said to him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine. 
\v 32 It was meet that we should make merry and be glad; for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. 
\c 16  
\p
\v 1 And he said also to the disciples, There was a certain rich man, who had a steward; and the same was accused to him as wasting his goods. 
\v 2 And he called him, and said to him, What is this that I hear of thee? Give an account of thy stewardship; for thou canst be no longer steward. 
\v 3 Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do, now that my lord taketh away from me the stewardship? I cannot dig, I am ashamed to beg. 
\v 4 I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, I may be received into their houses. 
\v 5 So he called to him every one of his lord's debtors, and said to the first, How much dost thou owe my lord? 
\v 6 And he said, A hundred measures of oil. And he said to him, Take thy bond, and sit down quickly, and write fifty. 
\v 7 Then he said to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, A hundred measures of wheat. He saith to him, Take thy bond, and write eighty. 
\v 8 And the lord commended the unjust steward for having done wisely; for the sons of this world are wiser toward their generation than the sons of light. 
\v 9 And I say to you, Make to yourselves friends with the unrighteous mammon; that, when it faileth, ye may be received into everlasting habitations. 
\v 10 He that is faithful in that which is least, is faithful also in much; and he that is unjust in the least, is unjust also in much. 
\v 11 If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches? 
\v 12 and if ye have not been faithful in that which is another's, who will give you that which is your own? 
\v 13 No servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate one, and love the other; or he will cleave to one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. 
\v 14 And the Pharisees, who were covetous, heard all this, and they derided him. 
\v 15 And he said to them, Ye are they who justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts; for that which is highly exalted among men is an abomination before God. 
\v 16 The Law and the Prophets were till John; from that time the glad tidings of the kingdom of God have been published, and every one is forcing his way into it. 
\v 17 But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one tittle of the law to fail. 
\v 18 Whoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery; and he who marrieth a woman that hath been put away from her husband, committeth adultery. 
\v 19 There was a certain rich man, who was clothed in purple and fine linen, and feasted sumptuously every day. 
\v 20 And a certain beggar named Lazarus was laid at his gate, full of sores, 
\v 21 and longing to be fed with what fell from the rich man's table. But even the dogs came and licked his sores. 
\v 22 And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels to the bosom of Abraham. The rich man also died and was buried. 
\v 23 And in the underworld he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. 
\v 24 And he called and said, Father Abraham, have pity on me, and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame. 
\v 25 But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou didst receive thy good things in thy lifetime, and Lazarus in like manner his evil things; but now he is comforted here, and thou art tormented. 
\v 26 And besides all this, between us and you there is placed a great gulf, so that those who wish to cross from hence to you may not be able, and that those on that side cannot cross over to us. 
\v 27 Then he said, I pray thee then, father, to send him to my father's house; 
\v 28 for I have five brothers; that he may give earnest warning to them, that they too may not come into this place of torment. 
\v 29 But Abraham saith, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them. 
\v 30 But he said, Nay, father Abraham; but if one should go to them from the dead, they would repent. 
\v 31 But he said to him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, they will not be persuaded, though one should rise from the dead. 
\c 17  
\p
\v 1 And he said to his disciples, It is impossible but that stumbling-blocks will come; but woe to him through whom they come! 
\v 2 It were better for him to have a millstone hung round his neck, and be cast into the sea, than to cause one of these little ones to fall away. 
\v 3 Take heed to yourselves. If thy brother sin, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him. 
\v 4 And if he sin against thee seven times in a day, and seven times turn to thee, saying, I repent, thou shalt forgive him. 
\v 5 And the apostles said to the Lord, Give us more faith. 
\v 6 But the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard, ye might say to this sycamine-tree, Be plucked up by the roots, and planted in the sea! and it would obey you. 
\v 7 And which of you having a servant plowing, or feeding cattle, will say to him, when he hath come in from the field, Come immediately and place thyself at table? 
\v 8 Will he not rather say to him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself and serve me till I have eaten and drunken, and afterward thou shalt eat and drink? 
\v 9 Doth he owe any thanks to that servant, because he did what was commanded? 
\v 10 So also do ye, when ye have done all that hath been commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants; we have done what we were bound to do. 
\v 11 And it came to pass, as he was going to Jerusalem, that he was traveling on the confines of Samaria and Galilee. 
\v 12 And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten lepers, who stood afar off. 
\v 13 And they lifted up their voice, saying, Jesus, Master, have pity on us. 
\v 14 And when he saw them, he said to them, Go, show yourselves to the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they were on their way, they were cleansed. 
\v 15 And one of them, perceiving that he was freed from his disease, turned back, giving glory to God with a loud voice; 
\v 16 and he fell down on his face at his feet, giving thanks to him; and he was a Samaritan. 
\v 17 And Jesus answering said, Were not the ten cleansed? Where are the nine? 
\v 18 Were there none found returning to give glory to God but this foreigner? 
\v 19 And he said to him, Rise and go; thy faith hath made thee well. 
\v 20 And being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God was coming, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not in such a manner as to be watched for; 
\v 21 nor will they say, Lo here! or there! for behold, the kingdom of God is in the midst of you. 
\v 22 And he said to the disciples, The days will come, when ye will desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and will not see it. 
\v 23 And they will say to you, Lo there! lo here! Go not away, and follow not. 
\v 24 For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of one part under heaven, shineth to the other part under heaven, so will the Son of man be in his day. 
\v 25 But first he must suffer much, and be rejected by this generation. 
\v 26 And as it was in the days of Noah, so will it be also in the days of the Son of man. 
\v 27 They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all. 
\v 28 In like manner, as it was in the days of Lot; they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded; 
\v 29 but on the day when Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all. 
\v 30 Thus will it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed. 
\v 31 In that day, let not him who is upon the house-top, and whose furniture is in the house, come down to take it away; and he that is in the field, let him likewise not turn back. 
\v 32 Remember Lot's wife. 
\v 33 Whoever shall seek to save his life will lose it; and whoever shall lose it will preserve it. 
\v 34 I tell you, In that night there will be two men on one bed; one will be taken, and the other will be left. 
\v 35 Two women will be grinding together; one will be taken, and the other left. 
\v 36  
\v 37 And they answering say to him, Where, Lord? And he said to them, Where the body is, there also will the eagles be gathered together. 
\c 18  
\p
\v 1 And he spoke a parable to them to show that they ought to pray always, and not be faint-hearted: 
\v 2 saying, There was in a certain city a judge, who feared not God, nor regarded man. 
\v 3 And there was a widow in that city; and she kept coming to him, saying, Avenge me of my adversary! 
\v 4 And he would not for some time. But afterward he said within himself, Though I neither fear God, nor regard man, 
\v 5 yet, because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her; lest by coming for ever she weary me out. 
\v 6 And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith. 
\v 7 And will not God avenge his chosen, who cry to him day and night, though he be slow to punish in their behalf? 
\v 8 I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. But yet, when the Son of man cometh, will he find faith on the earth? 
\v 9 And to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised all others, he spoke this parable: 
\v 10 Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican. 
\v 11 The Pharisee stood and prayed by himself thus: O God, I thank thee that I am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. 
\v 12 I fast twice in the week; I give tithes of all that I gain. 
\v 13 But the publican, standing afar off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven; but smote his breast, saying, O God, be merciful to me a sinner! 
\v 14 I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for every one that exalteth himself will be humbled; but he that humbleth himself will be exalted. 
\v 15 And they brought to him infants also, that he might touch them; and the disciples, on seeing it, rebuked them. 
\v 16 But Jesus called them to him, saying, Suffer the little children to come to me, and forbid them not; for to such belongeth the kingdom of God. 
\v 17 Truly do I say to you, Whoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, will not enter therein. 
\v 18 And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good teacher, what shall I do to inherit everlasting life? 
\v 19 And Jesus said to him, Why dost thou call me good? None is good but one, that is, God. 
\v 20 Thou knowest the commandments: “Do not commit adultery; Do not kill; Do not steal; Do not bear false witness; Honor thy father and thy mother.” 
\v 21 And he said, All these have I kept from my youth. 
\v 22 And Jesus hearing this said to him, One thing thou still lackest: sell all that thou hast, and distribute to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me. 
\v 23 But when he heard this, he became very sorrowful; for he was very rich. 
\v 24 And Jesus seeing him said, How hardly do they that have riches enter the kingdom of God! 
\v 25 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God. 
\v 26 And those who heard this said, Who then can be saved? 
\v 27 But he said, What is impossible with men is possible with God. 
\v 28 Then Peter said, Lo! we left what we had, and followed thee. 
\v 29 And he said to them, Truly do I say to you, There is no one that hath left house, or wife, or brothers, or parents, or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God, 
\v 30 who will not receive many fold more in the present time, and in the world to come everlasting life. 
\v 31 And taking the twelve aside, he said to them, Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all that hath been written by the prophets concerning the Son of man will be accomplished. 
\v 32 For he will be delivered up to the gentiles, and will be mocked, and insulted, and spit upon; 
\v 33 and they will scourge him, and put him to death; and the third day he will rise again. 
\v 34 And they understood none of these things; and the meaning of these words was hidden from them, and they did not comprehend what was said. 
\v 35 And it came to pass, as he drew near to Jericho, that a certain blind man was sitting by the wayside begging. 
\v 36 And hearing a multitude passing by, he asked what this meant. 
\v 37 And they told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by. 
\v 38 And he cried out, saying, Jesus, Son of David, have pity on me! 
\v 39 And they who went before sharply bade him hold his peace. But he cried out the more, Son of David, have pity on me! 
\v 40 And Jesus stopped, and ordered him to be brought to him. And when he had come near, he asked him, 
\v 41 What dost thou wish me to do for thee? And he said, Lord, to restore my sight. 
\v 42 And Jesus said to him, Receive thy sight; thy faith hath saved thee. 
\v 43 And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, giving glory to God; and all the people on seeing it gave praise to God. 
\c 19  
\p
\v 1 And he entered and was passing through Jericho. 
\v 2 And lo! a man named Zacchaeus; and he was a chief publican, and he was rich. 
\v 3 And he sought to see Jesus, what sort of man he was; and he could not on account of the multitude; because he was small of stature. 
\v 4 And he ran on before, and climbed up a sycamore-tree to see him; for he was to pass that way. 
\v 5 And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and said to him, Zacchaeas, make haste and come down; for today I must abide at thy house. 
\v 6 And he made haste and came down, and received him joyfully. 
\v 7 And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, He hath gone in to be the guest of a sinner. 
\v 8 And Zacchaeus stood up, and said to the Lord, Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken anything from any one by false representation, I restore him four-fold. 
\v 9 And Jesus said to him, This day hath salvation come to this house, inasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham; 
\v 10 for the Son of man came to seek and to save that which was lost. 
\v 11 And while they were hearing these things, he proceeded and spoke a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem, and they thought that the kingdom of God would immediately appear. 
\v 12 He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return. 
\v 13 And he called his ten servants, and gave them ten pounds, and said to them, Trade with these, till I come. 
\v 14 But his citizens hated him, and sent an embassy after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us. 
\v 15 And it came to pass, when he had returned, having received the kingdom, that he commanded these servants to whom he had given the money to be called to him, that he might know what each had gained by trading. 
\v 16 And the first came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds. 
\v 17 And he said to him, Well done, good servant! because thou hast been faithful in a very little, have authority over ten cities. 
\v 18 And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds. 
\v 19 And he said also to this servant, And be thou over five cities. 
\v 20 And another came, saying, Lord, behold thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin. 
\v 21 For I feared thee, because thou art a harsh man; thou takest up what thou didst not lay down, and reapest what thou didst not sow. 
\v 22 He saith to him, Out of thy mouth will I judge thee, wicked servant! thou knewest that I was a harsh man, taking up what I laid not down, and reaping what I did not sow; 
\v 23 why then didst thou not put my money into a bank? Then I at my coming might have received it back with interest. 
\v 24 And he said to them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that hath the ten pounds. 
\v 25 (And they said to him, He hath ten pounds, Lord.) 
\v 26 I say to you, that to every one who hath, will be given; but from him that hath not, even what he hath will be taken away. 
\v 27 But as for those enemies of mine, who would not that I should reign over them, bring them here, and slay them before me. 
\v 28 And when he had thus spoken, he went forward, going up to Jerusalem. 
\v 29 And it came to pass, as he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples, 
\v 30 saying, Go to the village over against us; on entering which ye will find a colt tied, whereon no man ever sat; and loose, and bring it. 
\v 31 And if any one ask you, Why are ye loosing it? ye shall say thus, The Lord hath need of it. 
\v 32 And they who were sent went and found just as he told them. 
\v 33 And as they were loosing the colt, its owners said to them, Why are ye loosing the colt? 
\v 34 And they said, The Lord hath need of it. 
\v 35 And they brought it to Jesus; and having thrown their garments on the colt, they set Jesus thereon. 
\v 36 And as he went on, they spread their garments in the road. 
\v 37 And as he was drawing near, just at the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the miracles which they had seen; 
\v 38 saying, Blessed be the King in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest heavens! 
\v 39 And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said to him, Teacher, rebuke thy disciples. 
\v 40 And he answering said, I tell you, that if these are silent, the stones will cry out. 
\v 41 And when he came near, as he beheld the city, he wept over it, 
\v 42 saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, and that in this thy day, the things that concern thy peace! but now they are hidden from thine eyes. 
\v 43 For the days will come upon thee, when thine enemies will cast up a mound about thee, and compass thee round, and shut thee in on every side, 
\v 44 and will level thee with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they will not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation. 
\v 45 And entering the temple, he began to cast out those who sold, 
\v 46 saying to them, It is written, “And my house shall be a house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of robbers.” 
\v 47 And he was teaching daily in the temple; but the chief priests, and the scribes, and the leading men of the people sought to destroy him. 
\v 48 And they could not find an opportunity of doing any thing; for all the people hung upon him, listening. 
\c 20  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass, on one of those days, as he was teaching the people in the temple, and publishing the good tidings, that the priests and the scribes with the elders came upon him, 
\v 2 and spoke to him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things? Or who is he that gave thee this authority? 
\v 3 And he answering said to them, I also will ask you a question; and tell me: 
\v 4 The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men? 
\v 5 And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we say, From heaven, he will say, Why did ye not believe him? 
\v 6 But if we say, From men, all the people will stone us; for they are persuaded that John was a prophet. 
\v 7 And they answered, that they did not know whence it was. 
\v 8 And Jesus said to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things. 
\v 9 And he began to speak to the people this parable: A man planted a vineyard, and let it out to husbandmen, and went abroad for a long time. 
\v 10 And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard; but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty-handed. 
\v 11 And he sent still another servant; and they beat him also, and treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty-handed. 
\v 12 And he went on to send a third; and they wounded him also, and cast him out. 
\v 13 And the lord of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps they will respect him. 
\v 14 But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir; let us kill him, that the inheritance may become ours. 
\v 15 So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What then will the lord of the vineyard do to them? 
\v 16 He will come and destroy these husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to others. And when they heard this, they said, God forbid! 
\v 17 But he, looking upon them, said, What then is this which is written, “The stone which the builders rejected, the same hath become the corner-stone”? 
\v 18 Every one who falleth upon that stone will be broken; but on whomever it falleth, it will grind him to powder. 
\v 19 And the scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on him in that hour, but they feared the people; for they knew that he spoke this parable against them. 
\v 20 And they kept watch on him, and sent forth spies feigning themselves to be righteous men, that they might take hold of his words, in order to deliver him up to the civil power and to the authority of the governor. 
\v 21 And they asked him, saying, Teacher, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, and hast no regard to the person of men, but teachest the way of God truly. 
\v 22 Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or not? 
\v 23 But perceiving their craftiness, he said to them, 
\v 24 Show me a denary. Whose image and inscription hath it? And they answered and said, Caesar's. 
\v 25 And he said to them, Render then to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. 
\v 26 And they could not take hold of his words before the people; and marveling at his answer, they held their peace. 
\v 27 Then some of the Sadducees, who deny that there is a resurrection, came to him, and asked him, 
\v 28 saying, Teacher, Moses wrote to us, “If a man's brother die, having a wife, and the same die without children, his brother shall take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.” 
\v 29 Now there were seven brothers; and the first took a wife and died childless. 
\v 30 And the second 
\v 31 and the third took her; and in like manner also the seven left no children, and died. 
\v 32 At last the woman also died. 
\v 33 In the resurrection then, of which of them is the woman the wife? for the seven had her for a wife. 
\v 34 And Jesus said to them, The sons of this world marry, and are given in marriage; 
\v 35 but they who have been accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage; 
\v 36 for they cannot die any more; for they are like the angels, and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection. 
\v 37 But that the dead are raised, even Moses hath shown at the Bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. 
\v 38 Now he is not a God of the dead, but of the living; for all live to him. 
\v 39 Then some of the scribes answering, said, Teacher, thou hast well said. 
\v 40 For they dared no longer to ask him any question. 
\v 41 And he said to them, How is it that men say that the Christ is David's son? 
\v 42 For David himself saith in the book of Psalms, “The Lord said to my lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 
\v 43 till I make thine enemies thy footstool.” 
\v 44 David then calleth him lord; and how is he his son? 
\v 45 And in the hearing of all the people he said to his disciples, 
\v 46 Beware of the scribes, who like to walk about in long robes, and love salutations in the markets, and the chief seats in the synagogues, and the first places at feasts; 
\v 47 who devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers. These will receive a far greater condemnation. 
\c 21  
\p
\v 1 And he looked up and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury. 
\v 2 And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites. 
\v 3 And he said, In truth I say to you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all. 
\v 4 For all these out of their abundance cast in to the offerings; but she out of her penury cast in all the living that she had. 
\v 5 And as some were saying of the temple, that it was adorned with goodly stones, and sacred gifts, he said, 
\v 6 As for these things which ye behold, the days will come, in which there will not be left here one stone upon another, that will not be throw down. 
\v 7 And they asked him, saying, Teacher, when then will these things be? and what will be the sign when these things are about to come to pass? 
\v 8 And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived. For many will come in my name, saying, I am He, and the time is at hand. Go not after them. 
\v 9 And when ye hear of wars and tumults, be not terrified; for these things must first come to pass; but not immediately is the end. 
\v 10 Then he said to them, Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; 
\v 11 and there will be great earthquakes, and in divers places famines and pestilences; and there will be fearful sights and great signs from heaven. 
\v 12 But before all these things they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to synagogues, and into prisons, and bringing you before kings and governors on account of my name. 
\v 13 It will turn out to you an opportunity for bearing testimony. 
\v 14 Settle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate l beforehand what ye shall answer. 
\v 15 For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries will not be able to withstand or gainsay. 
\v 16 And ye will be delivered up both by parents and brothers and kinsmen and friends; and some of you will they put to death. 
\v 17 And ye will be hated by all on account of my name. 
\v 18 But not a hair of your head will be lost. 
\v 19 By your constancy secure your lives. 
\v 20 But when ye see Jerusalem encompassed by armies, then know that her desolation is at hand. 
\v 21 Then let those who are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let those who are within the city go out of it, and let not those in the open country enter it. 
\v 22 For these are days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled. 
\v 23 But woe to the women with child, and to those having children at the breast, in those days! For there will be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people; 
\v 24 and they will fall by the edge of the sword, and will be led away captive into all the nations; and Jerusalem will be trodden down by the gentiles, until the times of the gentiles are fulfilled. 
\v 25 And there will be signs in the sun and moon and stars; and on the earth distress of nations, in perplexity at the roaring of the sea and waves; 
\v 26 men's hearts failing them from fear, and from looking for those things which are coming on the world; for the powers of the heavens will be shaken. 
\v 27 And then will they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. 
\v 28 And when these things begin to come to pass, look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh. 
\v 29 And he spoke to them a parable: Behold the fig-tree and all the trees; 
\v 30 when they have already shot forth, ye see it, and know of yourselves that summer is now nigh at hand. 
\v 31 So also, when ye see these things coming to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand. 
\v 32 Truly do I say to you, that this generation will not pass away, till all shall have taken place. 
\v 33 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away. 
\v 34 But take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be weighed down with surfeiting and drunkenness and worldly cares, and that day come upon you unawares. 
\v 35 For as a snare will it come on all that dwell on the face of the whole earth. 
\v 36 But watch at all times, and pray that ye may be able to escape all the things that are about to come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man. 
\v 37 And during the daytime he was teaching in the temple; but at night he went out, and lodged in the mount called the Mount of Olives. 
\v 38 And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, to hear him. 
\c 22  
\p
\v 1 Now the feast of unleavened bread, which is called the passover, was drawing near; 
\v 2 and the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how they might kill him; for they feared the people. 
\v 3 And Satan entered into Judas called Iscariot, who was of the number of the twelve. 
\v 4 And he went away, and consulted with the chief priests and captains, how he might deliver him up to them. 
\v 5 And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money. 
\v 6 And he agreed with them, and sought a good opportunity to deliver him up to them in the absence of the multitude. 
\v 7 Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed; 
\v 8 and he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and make ready for us the passover, that we may eat it. 
\v 9 And they said to him, Where wilt thou that we make it ready? 
\v 10 And he said to them, Lo! when ye have entered the city, there will meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he goeth in; 
\v 11 and ye shall say to the master of the house, The Teacher saith to thee, Where is the guest-chamber, where I may eat the passover with my disciples? 
\v 12 And he will show you a large upper room furnished; there make ready. 
\v 13 And they went and found as he had said to them; and they made ready the passover. 
\v 14 And when the hour had come, he placed himself at table, and the apostles with him. 
\v 15 And he said to them, Earnestly have I desired to eat this passover with you, before I suffer. 
\v 16 For I say to you, that I shall eat it no more, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God. 
\v 17 And he took a cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves. 
\v 18 For I say to you, that I shall not drink henceforth of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall have come. 
\v 19 And he took a loaf, and gave thanks, and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, This is my body, which is given for you; this do in remembrance of me. 
\v 20 And in like manner he took the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is about to be shed for you. 
\v 21 But lo! the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table. 
\v 22 For the Son of man indeed goeth away, as it hath been determined; but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed. 
\v 23 And they began to inquire among themselves, which of them it was that was about to do this. 
\v 24 And there arose also a contention among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest. 
\v 25 And he said to them, The kings of the nations rule as lords over them, and they who exercise authority over them are called benefactors. 
\v 26 But it is not to be so with you; but let the greatest among you be as the youngest; and he that is chief, as he that serveth. 
\v 27 For which is greater? he who reclineth at the table, or he who serveth? Is not he that reclineth at the table? But I am in the midst of you as he who serveth. 
\v 28 Ye however are they who have continued steadfastly with me in my trials. 
\v 29 And I appoint to you a kingdom, as my Father appointed to me; 
\v 30 that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom; and ye shall sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. 
\v 31 Simon, Simon, lo! Satan hath asked for you, that he may sift you as wheat. 
\v 32 But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not. And do thou, when thou hast returned to me, strengthen thy brethren. 
\v 33 And he said to him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee both to prison and to death. 
\v 34 And he said, I tell thee, Peter, a cock will not crow this day, till thou hast thrice denied that thou knowest me. 
\v 35 And he said to them, When I sent you without purse, or bag, or sandals, were ye in need of anything? And they said, Of nothing. Then he said to them, 
\v 36 But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise a bag; and he that hath not, let him sell his garment, and buy a sword. 
\v 37 For I say to you, that this which is written must be accomplished in me: “And he was reckoned among transgressors.” For that which concerneth me also hath an end. 
\v 38 And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said to him, It is enough! 
\v 39 And going out, he went, as he was wont, to the Mount of Olives; and the disciples followed him. 
\v 40 And when he was at the place, he said to them, Pray that ye may not enter into temptation. 
\v 41 And he withdrew from them about a stone's throw; and kneeling down he prayed, 
\v 42 saying, Father, if thou art willing to remove this cup from me—yet not my will, but thine be done! 
\v 43 And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him. 
\v 44 And being in an agony, he prayed more earnestly. And his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling to the ground. 
\v 45 And rising up from prayer, he came to the disciples, and found them sleeping for sorrow, 
\v 46 and said to them, Why sleep ye? Rise, and pray that ye may not enter into temptation. 
\v 47 While he was yet speaking, lo! a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, was at the head of them; and he drew near to Jesus to kiss him. 
\v 48 But Jesus said to him, Judas, dost thou betray the Son of man with a kiss? 
\v 49 And they who were about him, seeing what would follow, said, Lord, shall we smite with the sword? 
\v 50 And one of them smote the servant of the high-priest, and cut off his right ear. 
\v 51 But Jesus answering said, Permit thus far; and touched his ear, and healed him. 
\v 52 Then Jesus said to the chief priests and captains of the temple and elders who had come to him, Ye have come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs; 
\v 53 when I was daily with you in the temple, ye did not put forth your hands against me; but this is your hour, and the power of darkness. 
\v 54 And they seized him, and led him away, and brought him into the house of the high-priest. And Peter followed afar off. 
\v 55 And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the court, and had sat down together, Peter sat down among them. 
\v 56 But a certain maid-servant saw him sitting at the fire, and steadily looking at him said, This man also was with him. 
\v 57 And he denied him, saying, Woman, I do not know him. 
\v 58 And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou also art one of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not. 
\v 59 And in about one hour's time, another confidently affirmed, saying, In truth this man also was with him; for he is a Galilaean. 
\v 60 And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he was yet speaking, a cock crew. 
\v 61 And the Lord turned and looked upon Peter; and Peter remembered the word of the Lord, that he had said to him, Before a cock crows this day, thou wilt thrice deny me. 
\v 62 And he went out, and wept bitterly. 
\v 63 And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and beat him; 
\v 64 and having blindfolded him, they asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that struck thee? 
\v 65 And many other things did they scoffingly say against him. 
\v 66 And when it was day, the elders of the people, both chief priests and scribes, came together, and brought him before their council, saying, 
\v 67 If thou art the Christ, tell us. And he said to them, If I tell you, ye will not believe; 
\v 68 and if I ask, ye will not answer. 
\v 69 But from this time the Son of man will sit on the right hand of the power of God. 
\v 70 Then they all said, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said to them, Ye say what is true; for I am. 
\v 71 And they said, What further need have we of testimony? For we have ourselves heard from his own mouth. 
\c 23  
\p
\v 1 And the whole assemblage of them arose, and carried him before Pilate. 
\v 2 And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this man perverting our nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, and saying that he himself is the Christ, the king. 
\v 3 And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the king of the Jews? And he answering said to him, I am. 
\v 4 And Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowd, I find nothing criminal in this man. 
\v 5 But they were the more violent, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Judaea, beginning from Galilee, even to this place. 
\v 6 And when Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilaean. 
\v 7 And on learning that he belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was himself also at Jerusalem at this time. 
\v 8 Now Herod, when he saw Jesus, was very glad; for he had been wishing to see him for a long time, because he had heard about him; and he hoped to see some sign wrought by him. 
\v 9 And he put many questions to him; but he gave him no answer. 
\v 10 And the chief priests and scribes stood vehemently accusing him. 
\v 11 And Herod also with his guard of soldiers set him at nought and mocked him, and having arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, sent him back to Pilate. 
\v 12 And Herod and Pilate on that day became friends with each other; for they had before been at enmity. 
\v 13 And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, 
\v 14 said to them, Ye have brought to me this man, as one that perverteth the people; and behold, I have examined him before you, and have found nothing in this man to sustain the charges which ye bring against him. 
\v 15 No, nor yet Herod; for he hath sent him back to us; and lo! nothing deserving death hath been done by him. 
\v 16 I will therefore chastise, and release him. 
\v 17 Now it was necessary for him to release to them one at the feast. 
\v 18 And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas; 
\v 19 who, for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, had been cast into prison. 
\v 20 But Pilate again spoke to them, wishing to release Jesus. 
\v 21 But they cried out, saying, Crucify, crucify him! 
\v 22 And he said to them the third time, Why, what evil hath this man done? I have found him guilty of nothing deserving death; I will therefore chastise, and release him. 
\v 23 But they were urgent with loud voices, demanding that he should he crucified; and their voices prevailed. 
\v 24 And Pilate gave sentence that what they demanded should be done. 
\v 25 And he released him who for sedition and murder had been cast into prison, whom they asked for; but Jesus he delivered up to their will. 
\v 26 And when they had led him away, they laid hold on one Simon a Cyrenaean, coming out of the country, and laid on him the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus. 
\v 27 And there followed him a great multitude of the people, and of women who were bewailing and lamenting him. 
\v 28 But Jesus turning to them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me; but weep for yourselves, and for your children. 
\v 29 For lo! the days are coming, in which they will say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never gave nourishment. 
\v 30 Then will they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us. 
\v 31 For if they do these things in the green tree, what will be done in the dry? 
\v 32 And two others, who were malefactors, were led with him to be put to death. 
\v 33 And when they had come to the place which is called the Skull, they there crucified him, and the malefactors; one on the right hand, and the other on the left. 
\v 34 And Jesus said, Father, forgive them! for they know not what they do. And they divided his garments, casting lots. 
\v 35 And the people stood looking on; and the rulers sneered, saying, Others he saved; let him save himself, if this is the Christ of God, the chosen one. 
\v 36 And the soldiers also came up to him and made sport of him, offering him vinegar, 
\v 37 and saying, If thou art the king of the Jews, save thyself. 
\v 38 There was also an inscription over him: “This is the king of the Jews.” 
\v 39 And one of the crucified malefactors railed at him, saying, Art thou not the Christ? save thyself and us. 
\v 40 But the other answering said, rebuking him, Dost not thou fear God, since thou art in the same condemnation? 
\v 41 And we indeed justly; for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this man hath done nothing amiss. 
\v 42 And he said, Jesus, remember me when thou comest in thy kingdom. 
\v 43 And he said to him, Truly do I say to thee, Today shalt thou be with me in Paradise. 
\v 44 And it was now about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour, 
\v 45 the sun having failed; and the veil of the temple was rent in two. 
\v 46 And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit! And having said this, he expired. 
\v 47 And the centurion, seeing what was done, gave glory to God, saying, Surely this was a righteous man. 
\v 48 And all the multitudes that had come together to that sight, when they had seen the things which were done, returned, beating their breasts. 
\v 49 And all his acquaintances stood at a distance, and women that came with him from Galilee, beholding these things. 
\v 50 And lo! a man named Joseph, of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, being a councilor, and a good and righteous man, 
\v 51 who was not consenting to their purpose and deed, and was waiting for the kingdom of God,— 
\v 52 this man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. 
\v 53 And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a tomb that was hewn out of the rock; wherein no one had yet lain. 
\v 54 And it was the day of preparation, and the sabbath was now coming on. 
\v 55 And the women also, who had come with him from Galilee, followed after, and saw the tomb, and how his body was laid. 
\v 56 And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and on the sabbath they rested, according to the commandment. 
\c 24  
\p
\v 1 Now on the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came to the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared. 
\v 2 And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb; 
\v 3 and on entering they found not the body of the Lord Jesus. 
\v 4 And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed about this, lo! two men stood by them in glittering apparel; 
\v 5 and when they were terrified, and bowed their faces to the earth, the men said to them, Why seek ye the living among the dead? 
\v 6 He is not here, but hath risen. Remember how be spoke to you while yet in Galilee, 
\v 7 saying, The Son of man must be delivered up into the hands of sinners, and be crucified, and rise again on the third day. 
\v 8 And they remembered his words. 
\v 9 And returning from the tomb, they told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest. 
\v 10 It was Mary the Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James; and the other women with them told these things to the apostles. 
\v 11 And these words seemed to them as an idle tale, and they did not believe them. 
\v 12  
\v 13 And lo! two of them were going the same day to a village called Emmaus, distant a hundred and sixty furlongs from Jerusalem. 
\v 14 And they were conversing together about all those things which had taken place. 
\v 15 And it came to pass, while they were conversing and reasoning, that Jesus himself drew near, and went with them. 
\v 16 But their eyes were restrained from knowing him. 
\v 17 And he said to them, What discourse is this which ye have one with another, as ye are walking? And they stood sad. 
\v 18 And one, whose name was Cleopas, answering said to him, Art thou the only sojourner in Jerusalem that doth not know the things which have come to pass there in these days? 
\v 19 And he said to them, What things? And they said to him, The things relating to Jesus the Nazarene, who was a prophet mighty in word and deed before God and all the people; 
\v 20 and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him. 
\v 21 But we are hoping that it is he who is to redeem Israel; moreover, besides all this, it is the third day since these things were done. 
\v 22 And furthermore certain women of our company have amazed us; for going early to the tomb, 
\v 23 they did not find his body, and came, saying that they had even seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive. 
\v 24 And some of those who were with us went to the tomb, and found it to be as the women had said; but him they saw not. 
\v 25 And he said to them, O dull of apprehension, and slow of heart to believe all that the Prophets have spoken! 
\v 26 Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things, and enter into his glory? 
\v 27 And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets he explained to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself. 
\v 28 And they drew near to the village whither they were going; and he made as though he would go further. 
\v 29 But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us, for it is towards evening, and the day is now far spent. And he went in to stay with them. 
\v 30 And it came to pass, as he was at table with them, that he took the bread, and blessed it, and broke and gave it to them. 
\v 31 And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight. 
\v 32 And they said one to another, Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked with us on the way, while he opened to us the Scriptures? 
\v 33 And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem; and they found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together, 
\v 34 saying, The Lord hath risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon. 
\v 35 And they told what had happened on the way, and how he became known to them in the breaking of the bread. 
\v 36 And while they were thus speaking, he himself stood in the midst of them. 
\v 37 But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they beheld a spirit. 
\v 38 And he said to them, Why are ye troubled? and why do doubts arise in your hearts? 
\v 39 See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have. 
\v 40  
\v 41 And while they still disbelieved for joy, and wondered, he said to them, Have ye anything here to eat? 
\v 42 And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish. 
\v 43 And he took and ate it before them. 
\v 44 And he said to them, These are my words which I spoke to you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled which are written in the Law of Moses, and the Prophets, and the Psalms, concerning me. 
\v 45 Then he opened their understanding, that they might understand the Scriptures. 
\v 46 And he said to them, Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer, and should rise from the dead on the third day, 
\v 47 and that repentance for the remission of sins should be preached in his name among all the nations, beginning at Jerusalem. 
\v 48 Ye are witnesses of these things. 
\v 49 And I send forth upon you that which hath been promised by my Father; but do ye tarry in the city, until ye are endued with power from on high. 
\v 50 And he led them out as far as to Bethany; and he lifted up his hands and blessed them. 
\v 51 And it came to pass, while he blessed them, that he parted from them. 
\v 52 And they returned to Jerusalem with great joy, 
\v 53 and were continually in the temple, praising God.
