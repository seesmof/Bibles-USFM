\p
\v 1 The former narrative I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus both did and taught from the beginning 
\v 2 until the day in which, after he had through the Holy Spirit given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen, he was taken up; 
\v 3 to whom also he showed himself living, after he had suffered, by many sure proofs, appearing to them during forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God. 
\v 4 And while in assembly with them, he commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for what had been promised by the Father, which [[said he]] ye heard from me; 
\v 5 for John indeed baptized with water, but ye will be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days hence. 
\v 6 They therefore, having come together, asked him, saying, Lord, art thou at this time about to restore the kingdom to Israel? 
\v 7 But he said to them, It belongeth not to you to know times or seasons, which the Father appointed by his own authority. 
\v 8 But ye will receive power when the Holy Spirit hath come upon you; and ye will be my witnesses, both in Jerusalem and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and to the end of the earth. 
\v 9 And having thus spoken, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight. 
\v 10 And while they were looking earnestly into heaven as he went up, lo! two men stood by them in white apparel, 
\v 11 who said, Men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? This Jesus, who hath been taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same manner in which ye beheld him going into heaven. 
\v 12 Then they returned to Jerusalem, from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, within a sabbath-day's journey. 
\v 13 And when they had come in, they went up into the upper room where they were making their abode, namely, Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon the zealot, and Judas the brother of James. 
\v 14 These all continued with one accord in prayer, with women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers. 
\v 15 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the brethren, and said, (the number of the names together was about one hundred and twenty,) 
\v 16 Brethren, it was necessary that this scripture should be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit through the mouth of David spoke before concerning Judas, who became guide to those who took Jesus. 
\v 17 For he was numbered among us, and obtained the allotment of this ministry. 
\v 18 Now this man purchased a field with the wages of the iniquity; and falling headlong he burst asunder in the middle, and all his bowels gushed out. 
\v 19 And it became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that that field is called in their own tongue, Aceldamach, that is, Field of Blood. 
\v 20 For it is written in the book of Psalms, “Let his habitation be made desolate, and let no one dwell therein;” and, “Let another take his office.” 
\v 21 Of these men, therefore, who accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, 
\v 22 from the baptism of John until the day when he was taken up from us, must one be made a witness with us of his resurrection. 
\v 23 And they proposed two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. 
\v 24 And they prayed saying, Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all men, show which of these two thou hast chosen 
\v 25 to take the part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell away, that he might go to his own place. 
\v 26 And they cast lots for them; and the lot fell upon Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 And on the day of Pentecost they were all together in one place. 
\v 2 And suddenly there came out of heaven a sound, as of a rushing mighty wind; and it filled the whole house where they were sitting; 
\v 3 and there appeared to them tongues as of fire, distributing themselves; and one sat upon each of them. 
\v 4 And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues, even as the Spirit gave them utterance. 
\v 5 Now there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under heaven. 
\v 6 And when this sound took place, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because every one heard them speaking in his own language. 
\v 7 And they were amazed, and marveled, saying, Behold, are not all these who speak Galilaeans? 
\v 8 and how is it that we every one hear them in our own language, wherein we were born? 
\v 9 Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and those who inhabit Mesopotamia, Judaea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, 
\v 10 Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and Romans who sojourn here, both Jews and Proselytes, 
\v 11 Cretans and Arabians—how is it that we hear them speaking in our tongues the wonderful works of God? 
\v 12 And they were all amazed and were in doubt, saying one to another, What can this mean? 
\v 13 Others making sport of it, said, They are full of new wine. 
\v 14 But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said to them, Men of Judea, and all that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known to you, and hearken to my words. 
\v 15 For these are not drunken, as ye suppose; for it is the third hour of the day; 
\v 16 but this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel, 
\v 17 “It shall be in the last days, saith God, that I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters will prophesy, and your young men will see visions, and your old men will dream dreams; 
\v 18 and even on my servants, and on my handmaids, I will pour out of my Spirit in those days, and they will prophesy. 
\v 19 And I will show wonders in heaven above, and signs on the earth beneath, blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke; 
\v 20 the sun will be turned into darkness and the moon into blood, before the day of the Lord cometh, the great and notable day. 
\v 21 And it shall be that every one that calleth on the name of the Lord shall be saved.” 
\v 22 Men of Israel, hear these words! Jesus the Nazarene, a man approved of God to you by miracles, and wonders, and signs, which God wrought by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves know,— 
\v 23 this man, being delivered up by the settled purpose and foreknowledge of God, ye, by the hand of godless men, crucified and slew. 
\v 24 But God raised him up, having loosed the pains of death, because it was not possible that he should be held by it. 
\v 25 For David saith concerning him, “I saw the Lord always before me; because he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved. 
\v 26 Therefore my heart rejoiced, and my tongue exulted; moreover also, my flesh shall dwell in hope; 
\v 27 because thou wilt not abandon my soul to the underworld, nor wilt thou suffer thy holy one to see corruption. 
\v 28 Thou didst make known to me the ways of life; thou wilt make me full of joy with thy countenance.” 
\v 29 Brethren, I may speak to you with freedom of the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is among us to this day. 
\v 30 Being then a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn to him with an oath that he would set one sprung from his loins upon his throne, 
\v 31 he foresaw and spoke of the resurrection of Christ, that neither was he abandoned to the underworld, nor did his flesh see corruption. 
\v 32 This Jesus God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses. 
\v 33 Being therefore exalted by the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit, he hath poured forth this, which ye both see and hear. 
\v 34 For David did not ascend into the heavens; but he himself saith, The Lord said to my lord, “Sit thou on my right hand, 
\v 35 until I make thine enemies thy footstool.” 
\v 36 Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom ye crucified. 
\v 37 And when they heard this, they were pierced to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, Brethren, what must we do? 
\v 38 But Peter said to them, Repent, and let every one of you be baptized to the name of Jesus Christ for forgiveness of sins, and ye will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. 
\v 39 For the promise is to you and to your children, and to all that are afar off, as many as the Lord our God shall call. 
\v 40 And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this perverse generation. 
\v 41 They therefore received his word, and were baptized; and there were added on that day about three thousand souls. 
\v 42 And they were constantly attending on the teaching of the apostles, and the imparting [[of their substance]], the breaking of bread, and the prayers. 
\v 43 And fear came upon every soul; and many wonders and signs were wrought through the apostles. 
\v 44 And all that believed were together, and had all things common; 
\v 45 and they sold their possessions and goods, and divided them among all, as any one had need. 
\v 46 And attending daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread in a private house, they partook of their food with gladness and singleness of heart, 
\v 47 praising God, and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily those who were in the way of salvation. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 And Peter and John were going up together to the temple, at the hour of prayer, which is the ninth hour. 
\v 2 And a certain man lame from his birth was carried along, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of those who entered the temple; 
\v 3 who, seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, asked alms. 
\v 4 And Peter fixing his eyes upon him, with John, said, Look upon us. 
\v 5 And he gave heed to them, expecting to receive something from them. 
\v 6 Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but what I have I give thee. In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, rise up and walk. 
\v 7 And grasping him by the right hand, he raised him up; and immediately his feet and ankles received strength. 
\v 8 And leaping forth he stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking and leaping, praising God. 
\v 9 And all the people saw him walking, and praising God; 
\v 10 and they recognized him as the man that sat for alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple; and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened to him. 
\v 11 And as he held fast to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon's greatly wondering. 
\v 12 But Peter seeing it, answered the people: Men of Israel, why wonder ye at this? Or why look ye earnestly on us, as though by our own power or godliness we had made this man to walk? 
\v 13 The God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his servant Jesus, whom ye indeed delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to release him. 
\v 14 But ye denied the holy and righteous one, and asked that a murderer should be granted to you. 
\v 15 But the author of life ye killed; whom God raised from the dead, whereof we are witnesses. 
\v 16 And his name, through faith in his name, made this man strong, whom ye see and know; yea, the faith which is through him gave him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all. 
\v 17 And now, brethren, I know that ye acted in ignorance, as did also your rulers. 
\v 18 But God thus fulfilled what he had before announced by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ should suffer. 
\v 19 Repent therefore and turn from your ways, that your sins may be blotted out, in order that the times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, 
\v 20 and that he may send forth Christ Jesus, who was before appointed for you; 
\v 21 whom heaven indeed must receive until the times of a restoration of all things; of which times God spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from the days of old. 
\v 22 Moses indeed said, “A prophet will the Lord your God raise up to you from among your brethren, as be raised up me; him shall ye hear in all things, whatever he shall speak to you. 
\v 23 And it shall come to pass, that every soul which doth not hear that prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.” 
\v 24 And all the prophets also, Samuel and those who followed, as many as spoke, announced these days. 
\v 25 Ye are the sons of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying to Abraham, “And in thy posterity shall all the families of the earth be blessed.” 
\v 26 To you first, God, having raised up his servant, sent him to bless you in turning away every one of you from your iniquities. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 And while they were speaking to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them, 
\v 2 being indignant that they taught the people, and proclaimed in Jesus the resurrection from the dead. 
\v 3 And they laid hands upon them, and put them in prison until the next day; for it was now evening. 
\v 4 Many however of those who heard the word believed; and the number of the men became five thousand. 
\v 5 And it came to pass on the next day, that their rulers and elders and scribes, 
\v 6 and Annas the high-priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high-priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem. 
\v 7 And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, did ye do this? 
\v 8 Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, Rulers of the people, and elders of Israel! 
\v 9 If we are this day examined in respect to a good deed done to a cripple, by what means he hath been restored, 
\v 10 be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead,—by him doth this man stand here before you sound. 
\v 11 This is the stone which was set at nought by you the builders, which is become a cornerstone. 
\v 12 And there is salvation in no other; for there is not another name under heaven, that hath been given among men, by which we must be saved. 
\v 13 And when they beheld the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and common men, they wondered; and they recognized them as having been with Jesus. 
\v 14 And seeing the man that had been cured standing with them, they could say nothing in reply. 
\v 15 But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves, 
\v 16 saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a remarkable sign hath been wrought by them is manifest to all that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it. 
\v 17 But that it spread no further among the people, let us strictly forbid them with threats to speak any longer in this name to any one. 
\v 18 And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all, nor teach, in the name of Jesus. 
\v 19 But Peter and John answered and said to them, Whether it is right in the sight of God to hearken to you rather than to God, judge ye. 
\v 20 For we cannot but speak the things which we saw and heard. 
\v 21 So, having further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way to punish them, on account of the people; because all were glorifying God for that which had been done. 
\v 22 For the man was above forty years old, on whom this sign of the healing had been wrought. 
\v 23 And being released they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them. 
\v 24 And on hearing it, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou art he that made heaven and earth and sea, and all things that are in them; 
\v 25 who by the mouth of thy servant David said, “Why did the heathen rage, and the peoples meditate vain things? 
\v 26 The kings of the earth came up, and the rulers assembled together, against the Lord, and against his Anointed.” 
\v 27 For in truth against thy holy servant Jesus, whom thou didst anoint, did both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the gentiles, and the peoples of Israel, assemble in this city, 
\v 28 to do whatever thy hand and thy will before determined to be done. 
\v 29 And now, Lord, look upon their threatenings, and grant to thy servants that with all boldness they may speak thy word, 
\v 30 while thou stretchest forth thy hand to heal, and signs and wonders are wrought through the name of thy holy servant Jesus. 
\v 31 And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness. 
\v 32 And the multitude of those who believed were of one heart, and of one soul; and not one of them said that aught of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common. 
\v 33 And with great power did the apostles give their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus; and great grace was upon them all. 
\v 34 For there was no one among them that was in want; for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold, 
\v 35 and laid them at the feet of the apostles; and distribution was made to every one, according as he had need. 
\v 36 And Joseph, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, when interpreted, Son of consolation,) a Levite, born in Cyprus, 
\v 37 having land, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the feet of the apostles. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession, 
\v 2 and kept back part of the price, his wife also having knowledge of it; and brought a certain part, and laid it at the feet of the apostles. 
\v 3 But Peter said, Ananias, why did Satan fill thy heart that thou shouldst lie to the Holy Spirit, and keep back part of the price of the land? 
\v 4 While it remained, was it not thine own? And after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? Why didst thou conceive this thing in thy heart? Thou didst not lie to men, but to God. 
\v 5 And Ananias, hearing these words, fell down, and expired. And great fear came on all that heard of it. 
\v 6 And the young men arose, and wrapt him up, and carried him out, and buried him. 
\v 7 And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what had happened, came in. 
\v 8 Peter said to her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much. And she said, Yes, for so much. 
\v 9 And Peter said to her, Why is it that ye agreed together to try the Spirit of the Lord? Lo! the feet of those who have buried thy husband are at the door, and they will carry thee out. 
\v 10 And she fell down immediately at his feet, and expired; and the young men, when they came in, found her dead, and carried her out, and buried her by her husband. 
\v 11 And great fear came upon all the church, and upon all that heard of these things. 
\v 12 And many signs and wonders were wrought among the people by the hands of the apostles; and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch. 
\v 13 But of the rest no one dared to join himself to them. But the people highly honored them; 
\v 14 and more and more were believers added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women; 
\v 15 so that in the streets they brought out the sick, and laid them on beds and couches, in order that at least the shadow of Peter, as he passed, might overshadow some of them. 
\v 16 The multitude also belonging to the cities around came together to Jerusalem bringing the sick, and those plagued by unclean spirits; and they were all healed. 
\v 17 But the high-priest and all that were with him, which is the sect of the Sadducees, rose up and were filled with indignation, 
\v 18 and laid hands on the apostles, and put them in the public prison. 
\v 19 But an angel of the Lord in the night opened the prison-doors, and brought them forth and said, 
\v 20 Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life. 
\v 21 And hearing this, they went into the temple at daybreak and taught. But the high-priest and they that were with him came and called together the council, and all the elders of the sons of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought. 
\v 22 But the officers that came did not find them in the prison; and they returned and brought word, 
\v 23 saying, The prison we found shut in all security and the keepers standing at the doors: but when we opened them, we found no one within. 
\v 24 And when the priest, and the captain of the temple, and the chief priests heard these words, they were at a loss concerning them, to what this would come. 
\v 25 But one came and brought them word, Lo! the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people. 
\v 26 Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence, that they might not be stoned; for they feared the people. 
\v 27 And having brought them, they set them before the council. And the high-priest questioned them, 
\v 28 saying, We strictly commanded you not to teach in this name, and lo! ye have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and mean to bring this man's blood upon us. 
\v 29 But Peter and the apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men. 
\v 30 The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew by hanging him on a cross; 
\v 31 him hath God exalted by his right hand, as a Leader and Saviour, to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins. 
\v 32 And we are his witnesses of these things, and so also is the Holy Spirit which God hath given to those who obey him. 
\v 33 But when they heard this, they were filled with rage, and were resolving to kill them. 
\v 34 But there stood up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, in high esteem with all the people, and commanded to put the men forth a little while, 
\v 35 and said to them [[of the council]], Men of Israel, take heed to yourselves as to what ye are about to do in respect to these men. 
\v 36 For before these days arose Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain, and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and came to nought. 
\v 37 After this man arose Judas the Galilaean, in the days of the registering, and drew people away after him; he also perished, and all, as many as obeyed him, were dispersed. 
\v 38 And now I say to you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone; for if this design or this work be of men, it will come to nought; 
\v 39 but if it be of God, ye will not be able to overthrow them; lest haply ye be found also fighting against God. 
\v 40 And they were persuaded by him; and having called the apostles, they beat them, and commanded them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and released them. 
\v 41 They therefore went away from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame in behalf of that name; 
\v 42 and every day, in the temple, and in houses, they ceased not to teach, and to publish the glad tidings concerning Jesus the Christ. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1 But in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying, there arose a murmuring of the Hellenists against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration. 
\v 2 And the twelve called the multitude of the disciples to them, and said, It doth not seem to us proper, that we should leave the word of God, and provide for tables. 
\v 3 Therefore, brethren, look out among you seven men of good repute, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we will appoint over this business; 
\v 4 but we will give ourselves closely to prayer, and to the ministry of the word. 
\v 5 And what was said pleased the whole multitude. And they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaus a proselyte of Antioch, 
\v 6 whom they set before the apostles; and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them. 
\v 7 And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples in Jerusalem was greatly enlarged; and a great multitude of the priests were obedient to the faith. 
\v 8 And Stephen, full of grace and power, wrought great wonders and signs among the people. 
\v 9 But some of those who belonged to the so-called synagogue of the Freedmen, and of the Cyrenaeans and Alexandrians, and of those from Cilicia and Asia, arose and disputed with Stephen; 
\v 10 and they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke. 
\v 11 Then they suborned men, who said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and God. 
\v 12 And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and seized him, and brought him to the council, 
\v 13 and set up false witnesses, who said, This man ceaseth not to speak words against the holy place, and the Law. 
\v 14 For we have heard him say, This Jesus the Nazarene will destroy this place, and change the customs which Moses delivered to us. 
\v 15 And all that sat in the council, looking steadily upon him, saw his face like the face of an angel. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1 And the high-priest said, Are then these things so? 
\v 2 And he said, Brethren and fathers, hearken. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran, 
\v 3 and said to him, “Go forth from thy country and thy kindred, and come into the land which I will show thee.” 
\v 4 Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in Haran; and from thence, after his father was dead, he caused him to remove into this land wherein ye now dwell; 
\v 5 and he gave him no inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on; and he promised to give it to him for a possession, and to his posterity after him, when as yet he had no child. 
\v 6 And God spoke in this manner: “That his posterity should sojourn in a foreign land, and that they would bring them into bondage, and ill-treat them four hundred years; 
\v 7 and the nation to which they shall be in bondage will I judge,” said God; “and after that they shall come forth, and shall worship me in this place.” 
\v 8 And he gave him the covenant of circumcision; and so he begat Isaac, and circumcised him on the eighth day; and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob the twelve patriarchs. 
\v 9 And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt; and God was with him, 
\v 10 and delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt, and all his house. 
\v 11 Now there came a famine over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and great distress; and our fathers found no Sustenance. 
\v 12 But Jacob, hearing that there was grain in Egypt, sent out our fathers first. 
\v 13 And at the second time Joseph was recognized by his brothers, and the kindred of Joseph became known to Pharaoh. 
\v 14 Then Joseph sent and called his father Jacob to him, and all his kindred, seventy five souls. 
\v 15 And Jacob went down [[into Egypt]], and died, he and our fathers. 
\v 16 And they were removed to Shechem, and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem. 
\v 17 But as the time of the promise drew near, which God solemnly made to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt, 
\v 18 until another king arose, who knew not Joseph. 
\v 19 The same dealt subtly with our race, and ill-treated our fathers, so that they should cast out their infants, that they might not be preserved alive. 
\v 20 In which time Moses was born, and was exceedingly fair; who was nourished in his father's house three months. 
\v 21 And when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and nourished him for herself as a son. 
\v 22 And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in his worlds and deeds. 
\v 23 And when he was forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren, the sons of Israel. 
\v 24 And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed by smiting the Egyptian. 
\v 25 For he supposed his brethren would understand that God through his hand would give them salvation; but they understood not. 
\v 26 And the next day he showed himself to them as they were contending, and urged them to peace, saying, Ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one another? 
\v 27 But he who was wronging his neighbor thrust him away, saying, “Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us? 
\v 28 Dost thou mean to kill me, as thou didst kill the Egyptian yesterday?” 
\v 29 And Moses fled at this saying, and became a sojourner in the land of Midian, where he begat two sons. 
\v 30 And when forty years were completed, there appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai an angel in the flaming fire of a bush. 
\v 31 And Moses seeing it wondered at the sight; and as he drew near to behold it, the voice of the Lord came [[to him]], 
\v 32 saying, “I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob.” And Moses trembled and durst not behold. 
\v 33 And the Lord said to him, “Loose the sandals from thy feet; for the place where thou standest is holy ground. 
\v 34 I have surely seen the oppression of my people in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them; and now, come, I will send thee into Egypt.” 
\v 35 This Moses, whom they denied, saying, “Who made thee a ruler and a judge?” this very man did God send both as a ruler and a redeemer with the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush. 
\v 36 This very man brought them out, working wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness forty years. 
\v 37 This is the Moses who said to the sons of Israel, “A prophet will God raise up to you from among your brethren, as he raised up me.” 
\v 38 This is he that was in the assembly in the wilderness with the anger who spake to him on Mount Sinai, and with our fathers; who received the living oracles to give to us; 
\v 39 to whom our fathers would not be obedient, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back into Egypt, 
\v 40 saying to Aaron, “Make us gods who shall go before us; for as for this Moses, who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.” 
\v 41 And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice to the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands. 
\v 42 But God turned away, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the Prophets, “Did ye offer to me slain beasts and sacrifices for forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel? 
\v 43 And ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of the god Rephan, the figures which ye made to worship them; and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.” 
\v 44 Our fathers had the tabernacle of the testimony in the wilderness, as he that spoke to Moses commanded that he should make it according to the pattern that he had seen; 
\v 45 which also our fathers received and brought in with Joshua, at their taking possession of the gentiles whom God drove out from before our fathers, until the days of David; 
\v 46 who found favor before God, and asked that he might find a habitation for the God of Jacob. 
\v 47 But Solomon built him a house. 
\v 48 Yet the Most High dwelleth not in [[temples]] made with hands; as saith the prophet, 
\v 49 “Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. What house will ye build for me? saith the Lord; or what is the place of my rest? 
\v 50 Did not my hands make all these things?” 
\v 51 Stiffnecked, and uncircumcised in heart and ears! ye do always resist the Holy Spirit; as your fathers did, so do ye. 
\v 52 Which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute? And they slew those who foretold the coming of the righteous one, of whom ye have now become the betrayers and murderers; 
\v 53 ye who received the Law as ordained through angels, and did not keep it. 
\v 54 But when they heard these things, their hearts were filled with rage, and they gnashed their teeth at him. 
\v 55 But, being full of the Holy Spirit, he looked up earnestly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God, 
\v 56 and said, Lo, I behold the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God. 
\v 57 And they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and rushed upon him with one accord; 
\v 58 and having cast him out of the city, they stoned him. And the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul; 
\v 59 and they stoned Stephen, making supplication, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit. 
\v 60 And kneeling down he cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And saying this, he fell asleep. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1 And Saul was consenting to his death. And there arose on that day a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and all were scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles. 
\v 2 And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him. 
\v 3 But Saul ravaged the church, entering house after house, and dragging both men and women, committed them to prison. 
\v 4 Now those that had been scattered abroad went through the country preaching the word. 
\v 5 And Philip went down to a city of Samaria, and preached to them the Christ. 
\v 6 And the multitudes with one accord gave heed to the things spoken by Philip, when they heard and saw the signs which he wrought. 
\v 7 For from many that had unclean spirits came they out crying with a loud voice; and many that were palsied, and that were lame, were cured. 
\v 8 And there was great joy in that city. 
\v 9 But before their arrival a certain man, named Simon, was in the city, a man practising sorcery, and amazing the people of Samaria, saying that he himself was some great person; 
\v 10 to whom they gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the Power of God, which is called Great. 
\v 11 And to him they gave heed, because they had for a long time been amazed by his sorceries. 
\v 12 But when they believed Philip, publishing the glad tidings concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. 
\v 13 And Simon himself also believed, and having been baptized he continued with Philip, and was amazed when he beheld the miracles and signs which were wrought. 
\v 14 And the apostles at Jerusalem, hearing that Samaria had received the word of God, sent to them Peter and John; 
\v 15 who, having come down, prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit. 
\v 16 For it had not yet fallen upon any of them; but they had only been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus. 
\v 17 Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit. 
\v 18 But Simon, seeing that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, offered them money, 
\v 19 saying, Give me also this power, that on whomever I lay my hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit. 
\v 20 But Peter said to him, Thy money perish with thee! because thou didst think to obtain the gift of God with money. 
\v 21 Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter; for thy heart is not right in the sight of God. 
\v 22 Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray the Lord, if haply the thought of thy heart may be forgiven thee. 
\v 23 For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity. 
\v 24 And Simon answering said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of the things which ye have spoken may come upon me. 
\v 25 They then, when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, were returning to Jerusalem, and publishing the glad tidings in many villages of the Samaritans. 
\v 26 But an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, Arise, and go towards the south, to the way that goeth down from Jerusalem to Gaza. This is a desert way. 
\v 27 And he arose and went; and lo! a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch, a high officer of Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem to worship, 
\v 28 was returning and sitting in his chariot; and he was reading the prophet Isaiah. 
\v 29 And the Spirit said to Philip, Go near and join thyself to this chariot. 
\v 30 And Philip ran up, and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said, Well, but dost thou understand what thou art reading? 
\v 31 And he said, How can I, unless some one shall guide me? And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him. 
\v 32 And the passage of the scripture which he was reading was this: “He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so he openeth not his mouth. 
\v 33 In his humiliation judgment was refused him; and who shall describe his generation? for his life is taken away from the earth.” 
\v 34 And the eunuch answering said, I pray thee, of whom doth the prophet say this? Of himself, or of some other man? 
\v 35 And Philip opened his mouth, and beginning with this scripture declared to him the glad tidings concerning Jesus. 
\v 36 And as they went along the road, they came to a certain water; and the eunuch saith, See, here is water; what is there to hinder my being baptized? 
\v 37  
\v 38 And he commanded that the chariot should stop; and they both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him. 
\v 39 But when they had come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more, for he went on his way rejoicing. 
\v 40 But Philip was found at Azotus; and passing through, he published the glad tidings in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 But Saul, yet breathing out threatening and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest, 
\v 2 and asked of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any who were of this way of belief, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem. 
\v 3 And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus; and suddenly there shone around a him a light from heaven; 
\v 4 and he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? 
\v 5 And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And he answered, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. 
\v 6 But arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do. 
\v 7 And the men that journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing the voice, but seeing no one. 
\v 8 And Saul arose from the earth; but when his eyes were opened, he saw nothing; and they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus. 
\v 9 And he was three days without sight, and neither ate nor drank. 
\v 10 And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias, and to him the Lord said in a vision, Ananias! And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord. 
\v 11 And the Lord said to him, Arise, and go into the street called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul, of Tarsus; for lo! he prayeth, 
\v 12 and hath seen a man, named Ananias, coming in and putting his hand on him, that he might receive sight. 
\v 13 But Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how great evils he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem. 
\v 14 And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name. 
\v 15 But the Lord said to him, Go; for this man is to me a chosen vessel, to bear my name before nations, and kings, and the sons of Israel. 
\v 16 For I myself will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake. 
\v 17 And Ananias went away, and entered the house; and putting his hands on him, he said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus who appeared to thee in the way thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mayst receive sight, and be filled with the Holy Spirit. 
\v 18 And immediately there fell off from his eyes as it were scales; and he received sight, and arose, and was baptized. 
\v 19 And having taken some food he was strengthened. And he was some days with the disciples in Damascus. 
\v 20 And immediately he preached Jesus in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God. 
\v 21 And all that heard him were amazed, and said, Is not this he that destroyed in Jerusalem those who called on this name? And he hath come hither for this purpose, that he may bring them bound to the chief priests. 
\v 22 But Saul gained still more strength, and confounded the Jews who dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is the Christ. 
\v 23 But after many days had passed, the Jews took counsel together to kill him; 
\v 24 but their plot became known to Saul; and they were even watching the gates day and night to kill him. 
\v 25 But his disciples took him by night, and let him down through the wall, lowering him in a basket. 
\v 26 And when he had come to Jerusalem, he attempted to join himself to the disciples; and they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple. 
\v 27 But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and related to them how he had seen the Lord on the road, and that he had spoken to him, and hew he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus. 
\v 28 And he was with them going in and out at Jerusalem, 
\v 29 speaking boldly in the name of the Lord. And he often spoke and disputed with the Hellenists; but they were endeavoring to slay him. 
\v 30 But the brethren obtaining knowledge of it, brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus. 
\v 31 The church therefore throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being built up, and walking in the fear of the Lord; and by the exhortation of the Holy Spirit it was greatly increased. 
\v 32 And it came to pass, that as Peter went through the whole country, he came down also to the saints who dwelt at Lydda. 
\v 33 And there he found a certain man named AEneas, who had lain on a bed eight years, and was palsied. 
\v 34 And Peter said to him, AEneas, Jesus the Christ healeth thee; arise, and make thy bed. And he arose immediately. 
\v 35 And all that dwelt in Lydda and Sharon saw him; and they turned to the Lord. 
\v 36 Now at Joppa there was a certain disciple named Tabitha, which name being interpreted is the same as Dorcas, that is, Gazelle. This woman was full of good works and alms-deeds which she did. 
\v 37 And it came to pass in those days, that she fell sick, and died; and when they had washed her, they laid her in an upper chamber. 
\v 38 And as Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, having heard that Peter was there, sent to him two men with the entreaty, Do not delay to come to us. 
\v 39 Then Peter arose, and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber; and all the widows came to him weeping, and showing the coats and cloaks which Dorcas made while she was with them. 
\v 40 But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down and prayed; and turning to the body he said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes; and seeing Peter, she sat up. 
\v 41 And he gave her his hand, and raised her up; and calling the saints and the widows, he presented her alive. 
\v 42 And it became known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord. 
\v 43 And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon, a tanner. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1 Now a certain man in Caesarea, named Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band, 
\v 2 a devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, giving much alms to the people, and praying to God always, 
\v 3 saw in a vision plainly, about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming in to him, and saying to him, Cornelius! 
\v 4 And he, looking steadily at him, and becoming affrighted, said, What is it, Lord? And he said to him, Thy prayers and thine alms have come up for a memorial before God. 
\v 5 And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, who is surnamed Peter; 
\v 6 he lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the seaside. 
\v 7 And when the angel that spoke to him had departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of those who waited on him, 
\v 8 and having told them every thing sent them to Joppa. 
\v 9 On the morrow, as they were on their journey, and were drawing near the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray, about the sixth hour. 
\v 10 And he became very hungry and wished to eat; but while they were making ready, a trance came upon him, 
\v 11 and he beheld heaven opened, and a sort of vessel descending, as it were a large sheet having cords at the four corners, and let down upon the earth; 
\v 12 wherein were all the four-footed beasts and creeping things of the earth, and birds of the air. 
\v 13 And there came a voice to him, Arise, Peter; slay, and eat. 
\v 14 But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten anything common and unclean. 
\v 15 And a voice came to him again, the second time, That which God hath cleansed, call not thou common. 
\v 16 This was done three times; and the vessel was immediately taken up into heaven. 
\v 17 Now, while Peter was doubting within himself what the vision which he had seen meant, lo! the men who were sent from Cornelius had made inquiry for Simon's house, and stood before the gate; 
\v 18 and they called, and asked whether Simon, surnamed Peter, lodged there. 
\v 19 And while Peter was meditating on the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, men are seeking thee; 
\v 20 but arise, and go down, and go with them, without scruple; for I have sent them. 
\v 21 And Peter went down to the men and said, Behold, I am he whom ye are seeking; for what cause have ye come? 
\v 22 And they said, Cornelius a centurion, a righteous man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by a holy angel to send for thee to his house, and to hear words from thee. 
\v 23 Then he called them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow he arose and went forth with them, and certain of the brethren from Joppa accompanied him. 
\v 24 And the morrow after, he came into Caesarea. And Cornelius was expecting them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends. 
\v 25 And as Peter came in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and did him reverence. 
\v 26 But Peter raised him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man. 
\v 27 And while talking with him, he went in, and found many who had come together. 
\v 28 And he said to them, Ye know that it is an unlawful thing for a Jew to keep company with one of another nation, or to come near him; but God showed me that I should not call any man common or unclean. 
\v 29 Wherefore I came without objection, when sent for. I ask therefore, for what reason did ye send for me? 
\v 30 And Cornelius said, Four days ago, I was fasting till this hour; and at the ninth hour was praying in my house; and lo! a man stood before me in bright clothing, 
\v 31 and said, Cornelius, thy prayer hath been heard, and thine alms have been remembered before God. 
\v 32 Send therefore to Joppa, and call for Simon, who is surnamed Peter; he lodgeth in the house of Simon a tanner, by the sea-side; and he, when he cometh, will speak to thee. 
\v 33 I therefore sent to thee immediately; and thou hast done well in coming here. Now therefore we are all present before God, to hear all things that have been commanded thee from the Lord. 
\v 34 And Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is not a respecter of persons, 
\v 35 but in every nation he that feareth him and worketh righteousness is acceptable to him— 
\v 36 the word which he sent to the sons of Israel, publishing glad tidings of peace through Jesus Christ; he is Lord of all men. 
\v 37 Ye yourselves know what was spoken of through the whole of Judaea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism which John preached, 
\v 38 relating to Jesus of Nazareth, that God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power; who went about doing good, and healing all that were overpowered by the Devil; for God was with him. 
\v 39 And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem; whom they also slew by hanging him on a cross. 
\v 40 Him God raised up on the third day, and caused him to be manifested, 
\v 41 not to all the people, but to witnesses before appointed by God, to ourselves, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead; 
\v 42 and he commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that it is he who hath been appointed by God to be judge of the living and the dead. 
\v 43 To him all the prophets bear witness, that through his name every one that believeth in him shall receive forgiveness of sins. 
\v 44 While Peter was yet speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all that heard the word. 
\v 45 And those of the circumcision who believed, as many as came with Peter, were astonished that on the gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Spirit; 
\v 46 for they heard them speaking with tongues, and magnifying God. Then answered Peter, 
\v 47 Can any one forbid water, that these should not be baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit even as we have? 
\v 48 And he commanded that they should be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then they entreated him to remain some days. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 And the apostles and the brethren throughout Judaea heard that the gentiles also had received the word of God. 
\v 2 And when Peter went up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him, 
\v 3 saying, Thou didst go in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them. 
\v 4 But Peter rehearsed the matter to them in order from the beginning, saying, 
\v 5 I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision, a sort of vessel descending, as it were a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners, and it came even to me; 
\v 6 on which fixing my eyes, I observed, and saw the four-footed beasts of the earth, and the wild beasts, and the creeping things, and the birds of the air. 
\v 7 And I also heard a voice saying to me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat. 
\v 8 But I said, Not so, Lord; for nothing common or unclean ever entered my mouth. 
\v 9 But a voice answered the second time out of heaven, That which God hath cleansed, call not thou common. 
\v 10 And this was done three times; and all were again drawn up into heaven. 
\v 11 And lo! immediately there stood three men at the house where I was, having been sent to me from Caesarea. 
\v 12 And the Spirit bade me go with them. And these six brethren also came with me, and we entered the man's house. 
\v 13 And he told us how he had seen the angel in his house, standing and saying to him, Send to Joppa, and call for Simon, surnamed Peter; 
\v 14 who will speak to thee words by which thou shalt be saved, and all thy house. 
\v 15 And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, as on us at the beginning. 
\v 16 And I remembered the word of the Lord, that he said, John indeed baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit. 
\v 17 Since then God gave the like gift to them as to us, on believing in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I, that I could withstand God? 
\v 18 And when they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, So then to the gentiles also God hath granted repentance unto life. 
\v 19 Now they who were scattered abroad by the persecution that arose on account of Stephen traveled as far as Phenicia, and Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to none but Jews. 
\v 20 But some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they had come to Antioch, spoke to the Greeks, publishing the glad tidings of the Lord Jesus. 
\v 21 And the hand of the Lord was with them; and a great number believed, and turned to the Lord. 
\v 22 But the talk concerning them came to the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem; and they sent forth Barnabas, to go as far as Antioch; 
\v 23 who, when he came, and saw the grace of God, rejoiced, and exhorted all to cleave to the Lord with purpose of heart; 
\v 24 for he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a great multitude was added to the Lord. 
\v 25 And he went to Tarsus, to seek for Saul; 
\v 26 and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. And it came to pass, that for a whole year they came together in the church, and taught a great multitude; and the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch. 
\v 27 And in those days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. 
\v 28 And one of them named Agabus stood up, and signified by the Spirit, that there was about to be a great famine over the whole world; which came to pass in the days of Claudius. 
\v 29 And according as any one of the disciples was prospered, they determined every one of them to send relief to the brethren who dwelt in Judaea; 
\v 30 which also they did, sending it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 Now about that time, Herod the king laid his hands upon certain of the church, to oppress them. 
\v 2 And he slew James, the brother of John, with the sword. 
\v 3 And seeing that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to apprehend Peter also; (then were the days of unleavened bread;) 
\v 4 and he seized him and put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after the passover to bring him forth to the people. 
\v 5 Peter therefore was kept guarded in prison; but earnest prayer was made by the church to God in his behalf. 
\v 6 And when Herod was about to bring him forth, on that night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and keepers before the door were guarding the prison. 
\v 7 And lo! an angel of the Lord came to him, and a light shone in the room; and he smote Peter on the side, and roused him, saying, Rise up quickly. And his chains fell from his hands. 
\v 8 And the angel said to him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals; and he did so. And he saith to him, Throw thy garment round thee, and follow me. 
\v 9 And he went out, and followed; and he knew not that what was done by the angel was real, but thought he saw a vision. 
\v 10 And when they had passed the first, and the second guard, they came to the iron gate that leadeth to the city, which opened to them of itself; and they went out and passed on through one street, and the angel immediately departed from him. 
\v 11 And when Peter had come to himself, he said, Now I know certainly, that the Lord hath sent forth his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews. 
\v 12 And when he understood the matter, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, surnamed Mark, where many were gathered together, and praying. 
\v 13 And as he knocked at the door of the gate, a maid-servant came to listen, named Rhoda; 
\v 14 and recognizing Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for gladness; but ran in, and told them that Peter was standing before the gate. 
\v 15 And they said to her, Thou art mad. But she positively affirmed that it was even so. Then they said, It is his angel. 
\v 16 But Peter continued knocking; and opening the door, they saw him, and were amazed. 
\v 17 But beckoning to them with his hand to be silent, he related how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go and tell these things to James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went to another place. 
\v 18 And when it was day, there was no small commotion among the soldiers, as to what had become of Peter. 
\v 19 And Herod, when he had sought for him and found him not, examined the keepers, and commanded that they should be led away [[to execution]]. And he went down from Judea to Caesarea, and there abode. 
\v 20 And he was highly displeased with the Tyrians and Sidonians; but they came to him with one accord, and having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend, sued for peace; because their country drew its nourishment from that of the king. 
\v 21 And on a day appointed, Herod, having arrayed himself in royal apparel, and taken his seat on the throne, made a speech to them. 
\v 22 And thereupon the people shouted, The voice of a god, and not of a man! 
\v 23 But immediately an angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory, and he was eaten by worms, and expired. 
\v 24 But the word of God grew and was extended. 
\v 25 And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, having performed their service, taking with them also John, surnamed Mark. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 Now there were at Antioch, in the church that was there, prophets and teachers; Barnabas, and Simeon who was called Niger, and Lucius the Cyrenaean, and Manaen, the foster-brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul. 
\v 2 And while they were ministering to the Lord, and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them. 
\v 3 Then, after they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away. 
\v 4 They therefore being sent forth by the Holy Spirit, came down to Seleucia, and from thence sailed to Cyprus. 
\v 5 And having come to Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews; and they had also John as an assistant. 
\v 6 And when they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, they found a certain magian, a Jewish false prophet, whose name was Bar-jesus, 
\v 7 who was with the proconsul of the country, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. He, having called for Barnabas and Saul, desired to hear the word of God. 
\v 8 But Elymas the magian (for so is his name interpreted) withstood them, seeking so turn away the proconsul from the faith. 
\v 9 But Saul (who is also called Paul), filled with the Holy Spirit, fixed his eyes on him 
\v 10 and said, O full of all deceit, and of all mischief, son of the Devil, enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord? 
\v 11 And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou wilt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and darkness; and going about he sought to find some who would lead him by the hand. 
\v 12 Then the proconsul, when he saw what had taken place, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord. 
\v 13 And Paul and his company, having put to sea from Paphos, came to Perga in Pamphylia. But John, departing from them, returned to Jerusalem. 
\v 14 And they, going on from Perga, came to Antioch in Pisidia; and they went into the synagogue on the sabbath-day, and sat down. 
\v 15 And after the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, Brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, speak. 
\v 16 Then Paul stood up, and beckoned with his hand and said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, hearken. 
\v 17 The God of this people chose our fathers, and he exalted the people in their sojourn in the land of Egypt, and with a high arm he brought them out of it; 
\v 18 and for about forty years he nourished them in the wilderness. 
\v 19 And having destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land as a possession. 
\v 20 And after that, for about four hundred and fifty years, he gave judges, until Samuel the prophet. 
\v 21 And afterward they asked for a king; and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years; 
\v 22 and having removed him, he raised up to them David to be their king, to whom he gave testimony, saying, “I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after my own heart, who will do all my will.” 
\v 23 From the seed of this man hath God, according to his promise, brought to Israel a Saviour, Jesus; 
\v 24 before whose coming forward John had first preached a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. 
\v 25 And as John was finishing his course, he said, Who do ye think that I am? I am not He. But lo I there cometh after me one, the sandal of whose feet I am not worthy to loose. 
\v 26 Brethren, sons of the stock of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, to you was the word of this salvation sent forth. 
\v 27 For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, not knowing him, nor the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath, fulfilled them in condemning him. 
\v 28 And though they found nothing deserving death in him, they asked of Pilate that he should be slain. 
\v 29 And when they had accomplished all that was written of him, they took him down from the cross, and laid him in a tomb. 
\v 30 But God raised him from the dead, 
\v 31 and he was seen for many days by those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses to the people. 
\v 32 And we declare to you the glad tidings, that the promise which was made to the fathers 
\v 33 God hath fulfilled to us their children, in raising up Jesus [[from the dead]]; as it is also written in the first Psalm: “Thou art my Son; I have this day begotten thee.” 
\v 34 And that he raised him up from the dead, no more to return to corruption, he hath thus spoken: “I will give you the sure holy things promised to David.” 
\v 35 Wherefore also in another Psalm he saith, “Thou wilt not suffer thy holy one to see corruption:” 
\v 36 For David, after having in his own generation served the will of God, fell asleep, and was added to his fathers, and saw corruption; 
\v 37 but he whom God raised from the dead did not see corruption. 
\v 38 Be it therefore known to you, brethren, that through this man is announced to you the forgiveness of sins; 
\v 39 and by him every one that believeth is justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses. 
\v 40 Beware therefore, lest that come upon you which is spoken in the Prophets, 
\v 41 “Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish! for I work a work in your days, a work which ye will not believe, though one should plainly declare it to you.” 
\v 42 And as they were going out, they besought that these words might be spoken to them on the next sabbath. 
\v 43 And when the synagogue broke up, many of the Jews and proselyte worshippers followed Paul and Barnabas; who, speaking to them, exhorted them to continue in the grace of God. 
\v 44 And on the next sabbath almost the whole city came together to hear the word of the Lord. 
\v 45 But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with indignation, and spoke against what was spoken by Paul, contradicting and reviling. 
\v 46 Then Paul and Barnabas said boldly and plainly, It was necessary that the word of God should first be spoken to you; but seeing ye thrust it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of the everlasting life, lo! we turn to the gentiles. 
\v 47 For thus hath the Lord commanded us: “I have set thee to be a light of the gentiles, that thou mayst bring salvation even to the end of the earth.” 
\v 48 And when the gentiles heard this, they rejoiced, and glorified the word of the Lord; and as many as were ordained to everlasting life, believed. 
\v 49 And the word of the Lord was spread abroad throughout the whole country. 
\v 50 But the Jews stirred up the women of rank who worshipped God, and the chief men of the city, and raised a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them from their borders. 
\v 51 But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came to Iconium. 
\v 52 And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spoke that a great multitude both of Jews and Greeks believed. 
\v 2 But the Jews that disbelieved stirred up and embittered the minds of the gentiles against the brethren. 
\v 3 They abode therefore a long time there, speaking boldly in reliance on the Lord, who gave testimony to the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to be wrought by their a hands. 
\v 4 But the multitude of the city was divided; and some held with the Jews, and some with the apostles. 
\v 5 And when a movement was made both of the gentiles, and the Jews with their rulers, to abuse and stone them, 
\v 6 they became aware of it, and fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the neighboring country; 
\v 7 and they were publishing the glad tidings there. 
\v 8 And at Lystra there sat a certain man who had not the use of his feet, a cripple from his birth, who never had walked. 
\v 9 This man heard Paul speaking; who looking steadily at him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed, 
\v 10 said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped up and walked. 
\v 11 And the multitudes, seeing what Paul had done, lifted up their voices, saying, in the language of Lycaonia, The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men. 
\v 12 And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercury, because he was the chief speaker. 
\v 13 Then the priest of Jupiter, that was in front of the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and would have offered sacrifice with the multitudes. 
\v 14 But the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, when they heard of it, rent their garments, and rushed forth to the multitude, crying out 
\v 15 and saying, Men, why do ye these things? We also are men of like nature with you, bringing to you glad tidings, that ye may turn from these vanities to the living God, who made heaven and earth and sea, and all things that are therein; 
\v 16 who in the ages past suffered all the nations to walk in their own ways; 
\v 17 although he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, giving you rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness. 
\v 18 And with these words, they hardly restrained the multitudes from sacrificing to them. 
\v 19 But there came thither Jews from Antioch and Iconium; who, having persuaded the multitudes, and stoned Paul, dragged him out of the city, supposing him to be dead. 
\v 20 But the disciples having gathered around him, he rose up, and came into the city. And the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe. 
\v 21 And when they had published the glad tidings to that city, and had made many disciples, they went back to Lystra, and to Iconium, and to Antioch; 
\v 22 confirming the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and saying that it is through many afflictions that we mast enter into the kingdom of God. 
\v 23 And having appointed for them elders in every church, they prayed with fasting, and commended them to the Lord, in whom they believed. 
\v 24 And having gone through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia; 
\v 25 and when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia, 
\v 26 and thence set sail for Antioch, whence they had been commended to the grace of God, for the work which they had accomplished. 
\v 27 And when they had arrived and had gathered the church together, they related what great things God had wrought with them, and that he had opened a door of faith to the gentiles. 
\v 28 And they abode no little time with the disciples. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1 And there came down certain men from Judaea, and taught the brethren, Unless ye are circumcised after the custom of Moses, ye cannot be saved. 
\v 2 But when Paul and Barnabas had had no small dissension and debate with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain others of them, should go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question. 
\v 3 They therefore, having been sent forward by the church, passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the gentiles; and they caused great joy to all the brethren. 
\v 4 And having come to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church, and by the apostles and elders, and they related what great things God had wrought with them. 
\v 5 But there rose up certain believers of the sect of the Pharisees, saying, It is necessary to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses. 
\v 6 And the apostles and the elders came together to consider this matter. 
\v 7 And after much debate, Peter rose up and said to them, Brethren, ye know that a long time ago God made choice among you, that by my mouth the gentiles should hear the word of the glad tidings, and believe. 
\v 8 And God, who knoweth the heart, bore them witness, giving them the Holy Spirit, as he gave it to us; 
\v 9 and made no difference between us and them, having purified their hearts by faith. 
\v 10 Now therefore why do ye provoke the anger of God, by putting a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? 
\v 11 But we believe that we shall be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, in the same manner as they. 
\v 12 And all the multitude became silent, and listened to Barnabas and Paul, while they related what great signs and wonders God had wrought among the gentiles by them. 
\v 13 And after they had done speaking, James answered, saying, Brethren, hearken to me. 
\v 14 Simeon hath related how God first visited the gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name. 
\v 15 And with this agree the words of the Prophets, as it is written: 
\v 16 “After this I will return, and will rebuild the tabernacle of David which hath fallen; and I will rebuild its ruins, and will set it up; 
\v 17 that the rest of men may seek after the Lord, and all the gentiles, who have been called by my name, saith the Lord, who doeth these things, 
\v 18 which were known from the beginning.” 
\v 19 Wherefore my judgment is, that we should not trouble those who from among the gentiles are turning to God; 
\v 20 but that we should write to them by letter to abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from that which hath been strangled, and from blood. 
\v 21 For Moses from the times of old hath had in every city those who preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath. 
\v 22 Then it was decided by the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men from among themselves, and send them to Antioch, with Paul and Barnabas, namely, Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brethren. 
\v 23 And they wrote by them, “The apostles, and the elders, and the brethren, to the brethren who are from the gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, greeting. 
\v 24 Whereas we have heard, that some who went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, to whom we gave no command; 
\v 25 it seemed good to us, having become of one mind, to choose men and send them to you, with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, 
\v 26 men who have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
\v 27 We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who will themselves tell you the same things by word of mouth. 
\v 28 For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us, to lay upon you no further burden except these necessary things: 
\v 29 to abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication; from which if ye keep yourselves, ye will do well. Farewell.” 
\v 30 They therefore being sent away came to Antioch; and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the letter. 
\v 31 And when they had read it, they rejoiced over the encouragement. 
\v 32 And Judas and Silas, who were themselves prophets, exhorted the brethren with many words and confirmed them. 
\v 33 And when they had remained some time, they were dismissed with peace from the brethren to those who sent them. 
\v 34  
\v 35 But Paul and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and publishing, with many others also, the glad tidings of the word of the Lord. 
\v 36 And some days after, Paul said to Barnabas, Let us go again and visit the brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they are. 
\v 37 And Barnabas determined to take with them John, called Mark. 
\v 38 But Paul did not think it proper to take with them a man who had left them in Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work. 
\v 39 And there arose a sharp contention, so that they parted from each other, and Barnabas took Mark and sailed to Cyprus. 
\v 40 And Paul chose Silas and went forth, having been commended by the brethren to the grace of the Lord. 
\v 41 And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches. 
\c 16  
\p
\v 1 And he came to Derbe and Lystra; and lo! a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a believing Jewess, but whose father was a Greek; 
\v 2 who was well a spoken of by the brethren in Lystra and Iconium. 
\v 3 Him Paul wished to go forth with him, and took and circumcised him on account of the Jews who were in those places; for they all knew that his father was a Greek. 
\v 4 And as they journeyed through the cities, they delivered to them for their observance the decrees which had been ordained by the apostles and elders that were at Jerusalem. 
\v 5 The churches therefore were established in the faith, and increased in number daily. 
\v 6 And having gone through Phrygia and the Galatian country, on being forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach the word in Asia, 
\v 7 they came to Mysia, and were attempting to go into Bithynia; but the Spirit of Jesus did not permit them. 
\v 8 And passing by Mysia, they came to Troas. 
\v 9 And a vision appeared to Paul in the night. There stood a man of Macedonia beseeching him and saying, Come over into Macedonia and help us. 
\v 10 And when he had seen the vision, we immediately endeavored to go into Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to publish the glad tidings to them. 
\v 11 And setting sail from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothrace, and on the day following to Neapolis; 
\v 12 and thence to Philippi, which is a chief city of the province of Macedonia, a colony. And we remained in the city some days. 
\v 13 And on the sabbath-day we went forth out of the gate to a river-side, where was wont to be a place of prayer, and we sat down, and spoke to the women who had assembled. 
\v 14 And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, who worshipped God, was listening; whose heart the Lord opened to attend to the things which were spoken by Paul. 
\v 15 And when she had been baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be a believer in the Lord, come into my house, and abide. And she constrained us. 
\v 16 And it came to pass, as we were going to the place of prayer, that a certain bond-maid having a soothsaying spirit met us, who brought her masters much gain by soothsaying. 
\v 17 This woman followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, who announce to you the way of salvation. 
\v 18 And this she did for many days. But Paul, being much displeased, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And it came out immediately. 
\v 19 But her masters seeing that the hope of their gain was gone, laid hold of Paul and Silas, and dragged them into the market-place to the rulers; 
\v 20 and having brought them before the magistrates, said, These men are grievously disturbing our city, being Jews; 
\v 21 and they teach customs which it is not lawful for us Romans to receive or observe. 
\v 22 And the multitude rose up together against them, and the magistrates, tearing off their clothes, commanded to beat them with rods; 
\v 23 and when they had laid on them many stripes, they cast them into prison, charging the jailer to keep them safely; 
\v 24 who having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks. 
\v 25 But at midnight Paul and Silas praying, were singing praises to God; and the prisoners were listening to them. 
\v 26 And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and all the doors were immediately opened, and the bands of all were loosed. 
\v 27 And the jailer awakening out of sleep, and seeing the prison-doors open, drew his sword, and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped. 
\v 28 But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm, for we are all here. 
\v 29 Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and fell down trembling before Paul and Silas; 
\v 30 and having brought them out, he said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved? 
\v 31 And they said, Believe in the Lord Jesus, and thou wilt be saved, and thy household. 
\v 32 And they spoke to him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house. 
\v 33 And he took them with him at that hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and he was immediately baptized, himself and all that belonged to him. 
\v 34 And when he had brought them up into his house, he set food before them, and rejoiced with all his house, having become a believer in God. 
\v 35 And when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, Release those men. 
\v 36 And the jailer reported these words to Paul: The magistrates have sent to release you; now therefore come out, and go in peace. 
\v 37 But Paul said to them, They have publicly beaten us uncondemned, although we are Romans, and have thrust us into prison; and now do they thrust us out secretly? No; but let them come themselves, and bring us out. 
\v 38 And the sergeants reported these words to the magistrates; and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans. 
\v 39 And they came and besought them; and when they had brought them out, they entreated them to leave the city. 
\v 40 And when they had come out of the prison, they went into the house of Lydia; and when they saw the brethren, they exhorted them, and departed. 
\c 17  
\p
\v 1 And when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was the synagogue of the Jews. 
\v 2 And Paul, as his custom was, went in among them, and for three sabbaths discoursed to them out of the Scriptures, 
\v 3 explaining them, and setting forth that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead, and that “this is the Christ,—Jesus whom I am making known to you.” 
\v 4 And some of them were convinced, and joined themselves to Paul and Silas, and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the women of high rank not a few. 
\v 5 But the unbelieving Jews, taking with them certain bad men of the idlers in the market-place, and gathering a crowd, set the city in an uproar; and having come to the house of Jason, they endeavored to bring them out to the people; 
\v 6 but not finding them, they dragged Jason and some of the brethren before the city magistrates, crying out, These men that have turned the world upside down have come hither also; 
\v 7 whom Jason hath entertained; and they are all acting in opposition to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus. 
\v 8 And they alarmed the multitude and the city magistrates when they heard these things. 
\v 9 And having taken security of Jason and of the others, they let them go. 
\v 10 And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night to Berea; who, having come there, went into the synagogue of the Jews. 
\v 11 These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness, and searched the Scriptures daily, whether these things were so. 
\v 12 Many of them therefore believed; and of the Grecian women of rank and men, not a few. 
\v 13 But when the Jews of Thessalonica knew that at Beroea, too, the word of God was preached by Paul, they came hither also, and stirred up the multitudes. 
\v 14 And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go to the sea; but Silas and Timothy remained there. 
\v 15 And they who conducted Paul brought him to Athens; and having received a commandment to Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible, they departed. 
\v 16 Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred within him, when he saw the city full of idols. 
\v 17 Therefore he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout [[Greeks]], and in the market daily with those that met him. 
\v 18 And some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also conversed with him. And some said, What doth this babbler mean to say? and others, He seemeth to be a setter forth of foreign gods; because he brought the glad tidings of Jesus and the resurrection. 
\v 19 And they took him and brought him to Mars' hill, saying, May we know what this new doctrine is, of which thou speakest? 
\v 20 For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears. We would know therefore what these things mean. 
\v 21 Now all the Athenians, and the strangers residing among them, spent their leisure for nothing else but to tell or to hear something new. 
\v 22 Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, Men of Athens, in all things I perceive that ye are very devout. 
\v 23 For while passing along and observing your objects of worship, I found also an altar with this inscription, “To an unknown God.” What therefore ye, without knowledge of it, worship, that do I make known to you. 
\v 24 The God who made the world and all things therein, he, being Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands; 
\v 25 nor doth he receive service at the hands of men, as though he needed anything, since it is he that giveth to all life and breath and all things. 
\v 26 And he made of one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, having fixed appointed times, and the bounds of their habitation; 
\v 27 that they should seek God, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he is not far from every one of us. 
\v 28 For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as also some of your own poets have said: “For we are also his offspring.” 
\v 29 Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Deity is like to gold or silver or stone, graven by the art and device of man. 
\v 30 The times indeed of ignorance God overlooked; but now commandeth all men every where to repent; 
\v 31 inasmuch as he hath fixed a day, in which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he hath appointed; having given assurance to all by raising him from the dead. 
\v 32 And when they heard of a resurrection of the dead, some mocked; but ethers said, We will hear thee again about this matter. 
\v 33 Thus Paul departed from among them. 
\v 34 But certain men joined themselves to him, and believed; among whom was Dionysius the Areopagite; and a woman named Damaris, and others with them. 
\c 18  
\p
\v 1 After these things, Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth. 
\v 2 And having found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, and Priscilla his wife, (because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome,) he came to them; 
\v 3 and because he was of the same trade, he abode with them, and worked; for they were tent-makers by trade. 
\v 4 And he discoursed in the synagogue every sabbath, and endeavored to persuade both Jews and Greeks. 
\v 5 And when both Silas and Timothy had come from Macedonia, Paul was wholly engaged in the word, testifying to the Jews, that Jesus was the Christ. 
\v 6 And when they set themselves against him, and reviled, he shook his garments, and said to them, Your blood be upon your own heads! I am clean; from this time I will go to the gentiles. 
\v 7 And he departed thence, and went to the house of a certain man, named Justus, a worshipper of God, whose house was very near the synagogue. 
\v 8 And Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians upon hearing believed, and were baptized. 
\v 9 And the Lord said to Paul through a vision in the night, Be not afraid, but speak on, and be not silent; 
\v 10 for I am with thee, and no one shall lay hands on thee, to hurt thee; for I have much people in this city. 
\v 11 And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them. 
\v 12 And when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews rose up with one accord against Paul, and brought him before the judgment-seat, 
\v 13 saying, This man persuadeth people to worship God contrary to the law. 
\v 14 And as Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If it were some act of injustice or wicked misdeed, O Jews, with reason I should bear with you; 
\v 15 but if it be questions of doctrine, and names, and your law, look to it yourselves; I will not be a judge of these matters. 
\v 16 And he drove them from the judgment-seat. 
\v 17 But they all laid hold of Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment-seat; and Gallio cared for none of these things. 
\v 18 And Paul, having stayed many days longer, took leave of the brethren, and sailed thence to Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila, after he had shaved his head in Cenchreae, for he had a vow. 
\v 19 And they came to Ephesus, and he left them there; but he himself entered the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews. 
\v 20 And when they asked him to stay longer, he consented not; 
\v 21 but having taken leave of them, saying, I will return to you, if God will, he set sail from Ephesus. 
\v 22 And having landed at Caesarea and gone up and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch. 
\v 23 And after he had spent some time there, he departed, going through the Galatian country and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples. 
\v 24 And a certain Jew, named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the Scriptures, came to Ephesus. 
\v 25 This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught correctly the things concerning Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John. 
\v 26 And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. But Aquila and Priscilla having heard him, took him to them, and set forth to him the way [[of the Lord]] more fully. 
\v 27 And when he wished to go over into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to give him welcome; and when he was come, he gave much aid to those who had believed through grace. 
\v 28 For he publicly confuted the Jews, with power, showing by the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ. 
\c 19  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass, while Apollos was at Corinth, that Paul, having passed through the upper districts, came to Ephesus. And finding certain disciples, 
\v 2 he said to them, Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye believed? And they said to him, No, we did not even hear whether there is a Holy Spirit. 
\v 3 And he said, Into what then were ye baptized? And they said, Into John's baptism. 
\v 4 Then said Paul, John indeed baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying to the people, that they should believe on him that was coming after him; that is, on Jesus. 
\v 5 And when they heard this, they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus. 
\v 6 And when Paul bad laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke with tongues, and prophesied. 
\v 7 And the men were about twelve in all. 
\v 8 And he went into the synagogue, and spoke boldly for three months, discoursing and persuading concerning the kingdom of God. 
\v 9 But when some were hardened, and believed not, but spoke evil of the way [[of the Lord]] before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, discoursing daily in the school of Tyrannus. 
\v 10 And this continued for two years, so that all who dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks. 
\v 11 And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul; 
\v 12 so that even handkerchiefs, or aprons, were carried from his body to the sick, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out. 
\v 13 Then some of the wandering Jewish exorcists undertook to name over those who had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, I adjure you by that Jesus whom Paul preacheth. 
\v 14 And there were seven sons of Scevas, a Jewish chief priest, who did this. 
\v 15 And the evil spirit answering said, Jesus I knew, and Paul I well know; but who are ye? 
\v 16 And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them both, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. 
\v 17 And this became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, who dwelt at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified. 
\v 18 And many of the believers came, confessing and declaring their practices. 
\v 19 Many also of those who had practised magical arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men; and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver. 
\v 20 So the word of the Lord grew and prevailed mightily. 
\v 21 And when these things were ended, Paul resolved to pass through Macedonia and Achaia, and to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome. 
\v 22 And having sent into Macedonia two of those who ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a season. 
\v 23 And about that time there arose no small tumult concerning the faith. 
\v 24 For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, made silver shrines of Diana, and brought no small gain to the craftsmen. 
\v 25 And having called them together, with the workmen of like occupation, he said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth; 
\v 26 and ye see and hear, that this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, not only of Ephesus, but of almost all Asia, saying, that those are not gods, which are made with hands. 
\v 27 And there is not only danger that this branch of our business will come into disrepute, but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana will be despised, and her magnificence destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worship. 
\v 28 And hearing this they became full of wrath, and kept crying out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians! 
\v 29 And the city was filled with confusion; and they rushed with one accord into the theatre, having seized Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel. 
\v 30 And when Paul wished to go in to the people, the disciples would not suffer him. 
\v 31 And some also of the Asiarchs, who were his friends, sent to him, and entreated him not to venture into the theatre. 
\v 32 Some therefore were crying one thing, and some another; for the assembly was in confusion, and the greater part knew not wherefore they had come together. 
\v 33 And they brought forward Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward; and Alexander beckoned with his hand, desiring to make his defence to the people. 
\v 34 But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice for about two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians! 
\v 35 But when the Recorder had quieted the multitude, he said, Men of Ephesus, who is there among men that doth not know that the city of the Ephesians is guardian of the great Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter? 
\v 36 Since then these things cannot be denied, ye ought to be quiet, and do nothing rashly. 
\v 37 For ye have brought hither these men, who are neither robbers of temples, nor blasphemers of your goddess. 
\v 38 If then Demetrius and the craftsmen with him have a complaint against any one, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls; let them bring their charges against each other. 
\v 39 But if ye ask for any thing further, it shall be determined in the lawful assembly. 
\v 40 For we are in danger of being called to answer concerning this day's riot, there being no ground on which we shall be able to give an account of this concourse. 
\v 41 And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly. 
\c 20  
\p
\v 1 And after the tumult had ceased, Paul called to him the disciples, and having embraced them departed to go into Macedonia. 
\v 2 And when he had gone through those regions, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece. 
\v 3 And when he had stayed three months, a plot having been laid for him by the Jews as he was about to sail for Syria, he resolved to return through Macedonia. 
\v 4 And there accompanied him as far as Asia, Sopater, son of Pyrrhus, a Beroean; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus. 
\v 5 These having gone forward waited for us at Troas. 
\v 6 But we set sail from Philippi, after the days of unleavened bread, and came to them at Troas in five days, where we abode seven days. 
\v 7 And on the first day of the week, when we had assembled to break bread, Paul discoursed to them, being about to depart on the morrow, and continued the discourse until midnight. 
\v 8 And there were many lamps in the upper room where we had assembled. 
\v 9 And there sat on the window a certain young man named Eutychus, having fallen into a deep sleep; and as Paul was discoursing at great length, he sank down with sleep, and fell from thee third story, and was taken up dead. 
\v 10 But Paul went down and fell on him, and having embraced him, said, Make no lamentations; for his life is in him. 
\v 11 And having gone up again, and broken the bread and eaten, he talked a long while even till break of day, and so departed. 
\v 12 And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted. 
\v 13 We however, going forward to the ship, put to sea for Assos, intending to take in Paul from that place; for so he had appointed, intending himself to go on foot. 
\v 14 And when he met us at Assos, we took him on board, and came to Mitylene; 
\v 15 and sailing thence, we came the following day over against Chios. And the next day we arrived at Samos; and having tarried at Trogyllium, we came the next day to Miletus. 
\v 16 For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus, that he might not be detained in Asia; for he was hastening, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost. 
\v 17 And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church. 
\v 18 And when they had come to him, he said to them: Ye yourselves know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you the whole time, 
\v 19 serving the Lord with all humility, and with tears, and trials which befell me by the plots of the Jews; 
\v 20 how I kept back nothing that was profitable, but have made it known to you, and have taught you publicly, and from house to house; 
\v 21 testifying to both Jews and Greeks repentance toward God, and faith in our Lord Jesus. 
\v 22 And now behold, I go, bound in my spirit, to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that will befall me there; 
\v 23 save that the Holy Spirit witnesseth to me in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions await me. 
\v 24 But I count life of no value to me, so that I may finish my course, and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify the glad tidings of the grace of God. 
\v 25 And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I went about preaching the kingdom, will see my face no more. 
\v 26 Wherefore I testify to you this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men; 
\v 27 for I have not shunned to declare to you the whole counsel of God. 
\v 28 Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock over which the Holy Spirit made you overseers, to feed the church of the Lord, which he purchased with his own blood. 
\v 29 For I know this, that after my departure grievous wolves will enter in among you, not sparing the flock. 
\v 30 And from among yourselves will men arise speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them. 
\v 31 Therefore be watchful, and remember that for the space of three years, night and day, I ceased not to warn every one with tears. 
\v 32 And now I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, who is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all the sanctified. 
\v 33 I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel. 
\v 34 Ye yourselves know, that these hands ministered to my necessities, and to those that were with me. 
\v 35 In all ways I showed you that so laboring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said, It is more blessed to give than to receive. 
\v 36 And having thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all. 
\v 37 And they all wept sorely, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him; 
\v 38 sorrowing most of all for the word which he had spoken, that they were to see his face no more. And they accompanied him to the ship. 
\c 21  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass, after we had torn ourselves from them, and had put to sea, that we came with a straight course to Cos, and the day following to Rhodes, and from thence to Patara. 
\v 2 And finding a ship crossing over to Phenicia, we went aboard, and put to sea. 
\v 3 And having come in sight of Cyprus, we passed it on the left, and sailed to Syria, and landed at Tyre; for there the ship was to unlade her cargo. 
\v 4 And having found out the disciples, we remained there seven days; and they told Paul, through the Spirit, not to go up to Jerusalem. 
\v 5 And when we had completed the days, we departed, and went our way, they all accompanying us, with wives and children, till we were out of the city; and having kneeled down on the shore and prayed, 
\v 6 we took leave of each other, and went on board the ship; and they returned home. 
\v 7 But we, finishing our voyage, came down from Tyre to Ptolemais; and having embraced the brethren, remained with them one day. 
\v 8 And on the morrow we departed, and came to Caesarea; and entering the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, we stayed with him. 
\v 9 And this man had four daughters, virgins, who prophesied. 
\v 10 And while we were staying some days longer, there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus; 
\v 11 and coming to us, he took off Paul's girdle, and bound his own feet and hands, and said, Thus saith the Holy Spirit: So will the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and will deliver him into the hands of the gentiles. 
\v 12 But when we heard this, both we, and they of that place, besought him not to go to Jerusalem. 
\v 13 Then answered Paul, What mean ye that ye weep, and break my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus. 
\v 14 And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased; saying, The Lord's will be done. 
\v 15 And after those days we got ready our baggage, and went up to Jerusalem. 
\v 16 There went with us also some of the disciples of Caesarea, bringing us to one Mnason, a Cyprian, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge. 
\v 17 And when we arrived at Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly. 
\v 18 And the day following Paul went in with us to James; and all the elders were present. 
\v 19 And having embraced them, he recounted particularly what things God had wrought among the gentiles through his ministry. 
\v 20 And they on hearing it glorified God; and said to him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of believers there are among the Jews, and they are all zealots for the Law. 
\v 21 But they have been informed concerning thee, that thou teachest all the Jews who are among the gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children, nor to walk after the customs. 
\v 22 What then is to be done? The multitude will necessarily come together; for they will hear that thou hast come. 
\v 23 Do this therefore that we advise thee. We have four men who have a vow on them. 
\v 24 These take, and purify thyself with them, and pay the expenses for them, that they may shave their heads; and all will know that those things of which they have been informed concerning thee are nothing, but that thou thyself also walkest in observance of the Law. 
\v 25 But concerning the gentile believers, we have written to them and decided that they should observe no such thing, save only to abstain from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from what hath been strangled, and from fornication. 
\v 26 Then Paul took the men, and the next day having purified himself with them, entered the temple, announcing the completion of the days of the purification, until the offering was made for every one of them. 
\v 27 And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews from Asia, having seen him in the temple, stirred up the whole multitude, and laid hands on him, 
\v 28 crying out, Men of Israel, help! This is the man that teacheth every one everywhere against the people, and the Law, and this place; and besides he even brought Greeks into the temple, and hath polluted this holy place. 
\v 29 For they had before seen with him in the city Trophimus, the Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple. 
\v 30 And the whole city was in motion, and the people ran together; and they laid hold of Paul and dragged him out of the temple; and forthwith the doors were shut. 
\v 31 And while they were endeavoring to kill him, tidings came up to the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar; 
\v 32 who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them. And seeing the chief captain and the soldiers, they left off beating Paul. 
\v 33 Then the chief captain came near and laid hold of him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and inquired who he was, and what he had done. 
\v 34 And some cried one thing, and some another, among the multitude. And not being able to gain certain knowledge on account of the uproar, he ordered him to be carried into the castle. 
\v 35 And when he reached the stairs, he was obliged to be borne by the soldiers, on account of the violence of the crowd; 
\v 36 for the multitude of the people were following, crying out, Away with him! 
\v 37 And as he was about to be led into the castle, Paul saith to the chief captain, May I speak to thee? And he said, Canst thou speak Greek? 
\v 38 Art thou not then the Egyptian, who before these days made an insurrection, and led out into the wilderness those four thousand men of the assassins? 
\v 39 But Paul said, I am a Jew of Tarsus, a citizen of no mean city of Cilicia; and I beseech thee, suffer me to speak to the people. 
\v 40 And when he had given him leave, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with his hand to the people, and there was a great silence; and he spoke to them in the Hebrew tongue, saying, 
\c 22  
\p
\v 1 Brethren and fathers, hear my defence, which I now make to you. 
\v 2 And on hearing him speak to them in the Hebrew tongue, they kept the more silence. And he saith: 
\v 3 I am indeed a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, hut brought up in this city, taught at the feet of Gamaliel in the strictness of the Law of our fathers, being zealous for God, as ye all are this day. 
\v 4 And I persecuted this way [[of belief]] even to death, binding and putting into prisons both men and women, 
\v 5 as also the high-priest beareth me witness, and all the elderhood; from whom I received letters to the brethren, and was on my way to Damascus to bring those also that were there, bound, to Jerusalem, that they might be punished. 
\v 6 But it came to pass, as I was on my way, and approaching Damascus, that about noon there suddenly shone around me a great light from heaven; 
\v 7 and I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why dost thou persecute me? 
\v 8 And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said to me, I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom thou persecutest. 
\v 9 And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but the voice of him that spoke to me they did not hear. 
\v 10 And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there thou wilt be told of all which it hath been appointed thee to do. 
\v 11 And as I could not see by reason of the brightness of that light, I was led by the hand of those that were with me, and came into Damascus. 
\v 12 But one Ananias, a devout man according to the Law, well spoken of by all the Jews who dwelt there, 
\v 13 came to me, and standing over me said, Brother Saul, receive sight. And I immediately looked up upon him. 
\v 14 And he said, The God of our fathers chose thee to know his will, and to see the Righteous One, and to hear a voice from his mouth; 
\v 15 for thou shalt be a witness for him to all men of what thou hast seen and heard. 
\v 16 And now why dost thou delay? Arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on his name. 
\v 17 And it came to pass after my return to Jerusalem, while I was praying in the temple, that I fell into a trance, 
\v 18 and saw him saying to me, Make haste, and go quickly out of Jerusalem; for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me. 
\v 19 And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned, and beat in every synagogue, those that believed in thee; 
\v 20 and when the blood of Stephen, thy witness, was shed, I myself was standing by and consenting, and keeping the garments of those who slew him. 
\v 21 And he said to me, Depart; for I will send thee far hence to the gentiles. 
\v 22 And they listened to him as far as this word, and then lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth! for it was not fit that he should live. 
\v 23 And as they were crying out, and shaking their garments, and throwing dust into the air, 
\v 24 the chief captain ordered him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might ascertain for what cause they were thus crying out against him. 
\v 25 But when they had stretched him out with the cords, Paul said to the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned? 
\v 26 When the centurion heard this, he went and told the chief captain, saying, What art thou about to do? For this man is a Roman. 
\v 27 Then the chief captain came and said to him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yes. 
\v 28 The chief captain answered, For a great sum I obtained this citizenship. And Paul said, But I was born a Roman. 
\v 29 They therefore who were about to examine him left him immediately. And the chief captain also was alarmed when he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him. 
\v 30 On the morrow, wishing to have certain knowledge why he was accused by the Jews, he released him, and ordered the chief priests and all the council to assemble; and bringing Paul down, he set him before them. 
\c 23  
\p
\v 1 And Paul looking earnestly upon the council, said: Brethren! I have ordered my life in all good conscience before God to this day. 
\v 2 And the high-priest, Ananias, commanded those who stood by him to smite him on the mouth. 
\v 3 Then Paul said to him, God will smite thee, thou whited wall! Art thou then sitting to judge me according to the law, and dost thou command me to be smitten contrary to the law? 
\v 4 And they that stood by said, Dost thou revile God's high-priest? 
\v 5 Then said Paul, I knew not, brethren, that he was high-priest; for it is written, “Thou shalt not speak evil of a ruler of thy people.” 
\v 6 But Paul, perceiving one part to be Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, cried aloud in the council, Brethren! I am a Pharisee, the son of Pharisees; for the hope of the resurrection of the dead I am now tried. 
\v 7 And when he had said this, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees; and the multitude was divided. 
\v 8 For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, and no angel or spirit; but the Pharisees affirm both. 
\v 9 And there arose a great clamor; and scribes of the party of the Pharisees arose, and contended, saying, We find nothing amiss in this man; but if a spirit hath spoken to him or an angel— 
\v 10 And a great dissension arising, the chief captain, fearing that Paul would be torn in pieces by them, ordered the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them, and bring him into the castle. 
\v 11 And the night following, the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good courage; for as thou hast borne witness concerning me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome. 
\v 12 And when it was day, the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul. 
\v 13 And there were more than forty who took this oath together. 
\v 14 And they came to the chief priests and the elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, to taste nothing until we have killed Paul. 
\v 15 Now therefore do ye with the council give notice to the chief captain, that he bring him down to you, as though ye were about to examine his case more thoroughly; and we are ready to kill him before he cometh near you. 
\v 16 But Paul's sister's son hearing of the plot went, and entering the castle, told Paul. 
\v 17 Then Paul called one of the centurions to him, and said, Take this young man to the chief captain; for he hath something to tell him. 
\v 18 So he took him and brought him to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me to him, and asked me to bring this young man to thee, as he hath something to say to thee. 
\v 19 Then the chief captain took him by the hand and went aside privately, and asked him, What is it that thou hast to tell me? 
\v 20 And he said, The Jews have agreed to ask thee to bring down Paul tomorrow into the council, as though thou wert about to inquire more thoroughly concerning him. 
\v 21 But do not thou yield to them; for there lie in wait for him more than forty men of them, who have bound themselves with an oath neither to eat nor drink till they have killed him; and they are now ready, looking for the promise from thee. 
\v 22 The chief captain then dismissed the young man with the charge, Tell no one that thou hast disclosed these things to me. 
\v 23 And he called to him two of the centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen, at the third hour of the night; 
\v 24 and provide beasts, whereon they may set Paul, and carry him safe to Felix the governor. 
\v 25 And he wrote a letter after this manner: 
\v 26 Claudius Lysias to the moss excellent governor Felix, greeting. 
\v 27 This man was taken by the Jews, and was about to be killed by them; but I came upon them with the soldiery, and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman. 
\v 28 And wishing to know the crime of which they accused him, I brought him down to their council; 
\v 29 but I found him to be accused only on account of questions of their law, and to have nothing laid to his charge deserving death or bonds. 
\v 30 And having been informed of a plot against the man, I sent him at once to thee, and directed his accusers also to bring their charges against him before thee. 
\v 31 Then the soldiers, as was commanded them, took Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris. 
\v 32 But on the morrow they left the horsemen to go on with him, and returned to the castle. 
\v 33 And they, when they had come to Caesarea, and delivered the letter to the governor, presented Paul also before him. 
\v 34 And having read the letter, he asked of what province he was; and when he understood that he was of Cilicia, 
\v 35 he said, I will hear thee fully, when thy accusers also have arrived. And he ordered him to be kept in Herod's palace. 
\c 24  
\p
\v 1 And after five days Ananias, the high-priest, came down with the elders and a certain orator named Tertullus; and they brought a complaint before the governor against Paul. 
\v 2 And when he had been called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy much peace, and that improvements are in every way and everywhere taking place in this nation through thy foresight, 
\v 3 we accept it, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness. 
\v 4 But not to detain thee too long, I pray thee to hear us, in thy clemency, a few words. 
\v 5 For we have found this man to be a pest, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes; 
\v 6 who also attempted to profane the temple, and we apprehended him; 
\v 7  
\v 8 and from him thou canst thyself ascertain by examination all these things of which we accuse him. 
\v 9 And the Jews also joined in the charges against him, affirming that these things were so. 
\v 10 Then Paul, after the governor had beckoned to him to speak, answered, Since I know that thou hast been for many years a judge for this nation, I answer for myself cheerfully; 
\v 11 for it is in thy power to ascertain that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship. 
\v 12 And neither in the temple did they find me disputing with any one, or stirring up a tumult of the people, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city; 
\v 13 nor can they prove the things of which they now accuse me. 
\v 14 But this I acknowledge to thee, that according to the way [[of belief]] which they call a sect, so do I worship the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the Law and by the Prophets; 
\v 15 having a hope in God, which they themselves also entertain, that there will be a resurrection both of the righteous and the unrighteous. 
\v 16 On this ground do I also myself strive to have always a conscience void of offence toward God and toward men. 
\v 17 And after some years I came to bring alms to my nation, and to make offerings; 
\v 18 in doing which they found me purified in the temple, not with a crowd nor with tumult; but certain Jews from Asia [[caused it]], 
\v 19 who ought to be here before thee, and make their charge, if they had aught against me. 
\v 20 Or, let these men themselves say what wrongdoing they found in me when I stood before the council, 
\v 21 except in relation to this one expression, which I uttered aloud while standing among them: Concerning the resurrection of the dead I am tried before you this day. 
\v 22 But Felix, having an accurate knowledge of the matters relating to this way [[of belief]], put them off, and said, When Lysias the chief captain cometh down, I will thoroughly examine your case. 
\v 23 He also gave orders to the centurion to guard him, and let him have indulgence, and not to forbid any of his friends to do him service. 
\v 24 And after some days, Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ. 
\v 25 And as he discoursed of righteousness, and temperance, and the judgment to come, Felix became alarmed, and answered, Go thy way for the present; and when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee. 
\v 26 He hoped also that money would be given him by Paul; on which account he sent for him the oftener, and conversed with him. 
\v 27 But after two years Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and Felix, wishing to gain favor with the Jews, left Paul bound. 
\c 25  
\p
\v 1 Festus therefore having come into the province, after three days went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem. 
\v 2 And the chief priests and the leaders of the Jews brought a complaint before him against Paul, and besought him, 
\v 3 asking for themselves a favor against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, intending to place men in wait to kill him on the road. 
\v 4 But Festus answered that Paul was in custody at Caesarea, and that he himself was going thither shortly. 
\v 5 Let those therefore, said he, who have authority among you, go down with me and accuse this man, if he is guilty of anything. 
\v 6 And having tarried among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea; and on the morrow, sitting on the judgment-seat, ordered Paul to be brought. 
\v 7 And when he had come, the Jews who came down from Jerusalem stood around, bringing many and heavy charges which they could not prove; 
\v 8 while Paul said in his defence, Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar have I committed any offence. 
\v 9 But Festus, wishing to gain favor with the Jews, answered Paul and said, Art thou willing to go up to Jerusalem, and there be tried on these charges before me? 
\v 10 But Paul said, I stand at the judgment-seat of Caesar, where I ought to be tried. To the Jews I have done no wrong, as thou also very well knowest. 
\v 11 If indeed I am an offender, and have done anything deserving death, I refuse not to die; but if there be nothing in the charges which they bring against me, no man can give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar. 
\v 12 Then Festus having conferred with the council, answered, Thou hast appealed to Caesar; to Caesar shalt thou go. 
\v 13 And after some days Agrippa the king and Bernice came to Caesarea to greet Festus. 
\v 14 And while they were making a stay of some days there, Festus laid the case of Paul before the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix, 
\v 15 against whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews brought a complaint, asking for judgment against him. 
\v 16 To whom I answered, It is not the custom of the Romans to give up any man on a charge, before the accused hath the accusers face to face, and hath opportunity to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him. 
\v 17 When therefore they had come together here, without any delay I sat on the judgment-seat on the day after, and ordered the man to be brought forward. 
\v 18 And his accusers standing around him brought no accusation of such things as I had conjectured, 
\v 19 but had against him certain questions of their own religion, and of one Jesus that was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive. 
\v 20 And I being at a loss about such questions, asked him if he was willing to go to Jerusalem and there be put on trial for these matters. 
\v 21 But Paul having appealed to be kept in custody for the judgment of Augustus, I ordered him to be kept till I should send him up to Caesar. 
\v 22 Then Agrippa said to Festus, I should like to hear the man myself. Tomorrow, said he, thou shalt hear him. 
\v 23 Accordingly on the morrow Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp, and entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains and principal men of the city, and at the order of Festus Paul was brought forward. 
\v 24 And Festus said: King Agrippa, and all men who are here present with us! Ye see this man about whom the whole multitude of the Jews applied to me both at Jerusalem and here, crying out that he ought no longer to live. 
\v 25 But having found that he had done nothing deserving death, and he himself having appealed to Augustus, I determined to send him; 
\v 26 and as I have nothing certain to write about him to the emperor, I have brought him forward before you, and specially before thee, king Agrippa, that when the examination hath been made, I may have something to write. 
\v 27 For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner and not signify the charges against him; 
\c 26  
\p
\v 1 And Agrippa said to Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth his hand and made his defence: 
\v 2 I think myself happy, king Agrippa, that I am to make my defence this day before thee concerning all things of which I am accused by the Jews; 
\v 3 especially as thou art acquainted with all the customs and questions among the Jews. Wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently. 
\v 4 My manner of life, then, from my youth, which was from the beginning among my own nation and at Jerusalem, all Jews know: 
\v 5 and they know, if they are willing to testify, that from the first, according to the strictest sect of our religion, I lived a Pharisee. 
\v 6 And now I stand on trial for the hope of the promise made by God to the fathers, 
\v 7 which our twelve tribes, earnestly serving God day and night, hope to obtain; concerning which hope, O king, I am accused by Jews. 
\v 8 Why is it judged incredible with you if God raiseth the dead? 
\v 9 I indeed thought with myself that I ought to do many things in opposition to the name of Jesus the Nazarene. 
\v 10 Which I also did in Jerusalem; and many of the saints did I myself shut up in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them. 
\v 11 And I punished them often in all the synagogues, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I pursued them even to foreign cities. 
\v 12 And as I was going to Damascus on this business, with authority and a commission from the chief priests, 
\v 13 at mid-day, on the road, O king, I saw a light from heaven above the brightness of the sun, shining around me and those who were journeying with me. 
\v 14 And when we had all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking to me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? It is hard for thee to kick against the goads. 
\v 15 And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus, whom thou persecutest. 
\v 16 But arise and stand upon thy feet; for I have appeared to thee for this purpose, to prepare thee as a minister and a witness both of the things which thou sawest, and of those on account of which I will appear to thee; 
\v 17 delivering thee from the people, and from the gentiles, to whom I send thee, 
\v 18 to open their eyes that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and an inheritance among the sanctified, by faith in me. 
\v 19 Wherefore, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision; 
\v 20 but first to those in Damascus, and Jerusalem, and to all the country of Judaea, and then to the gentiles, I proclaimed that they should repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance. 
\v 21 For these causes the Jews seized me in the temple, and attempted to kill me. 
\v 22 Having, however, obtained help from God, I continue to this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying nothing except those things which the Prophets and Moses said were to come to pass; 
\v 23 that the Christ should suffer, and that, as first of those raised from the dead, he was to proclaim light both to the people and to the gentiles. 
\v 24 And as he was thus speaking in his defence, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning is making thee mad. 
\v 25 But he saith, I am not mad, most noble Festus, but utter words of truth and soberness. 
\v 26 For the king knoweth about these things well; to whom also I speak boldly; for I am persuaded that none of these things is hidden from him: for this was not done in a corner. 
\v 27 King Agrippa, believest thou the Prophets? I know that thou believest. 
\v 28 Then Agrippa said to Paul, With little effort thou thinkest to persuade me to become a Christian. 
\v 29 And Paul said, I would to God, that with little effort or with great, not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, might be made such as I am, except these bonds. 
\v 30 And the king rose up and the governor and Bernice, and those who sat with them; 
\v 31 and going aside they talked with each other, saying, This man is doing nothing deserving death, or bonds. 
\v 32 And Agrippa said to Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed to Caesar. 
\c 27  
\p
\v 1 And when it was determined that we should sail for Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, of the Augustan band. 
\v 2 And going on board a ship of Adramyttium, about to sail along the coasts of Asia, we put to sea; Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us. 
\v 3 And the next day we landed at Sidon; and Julius treated Paul kindly, and gave him leave to go to his friends, and receive their care. 
\v 4 And thence putting to sea, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary. 
\v 5 And having sailed over the sea along Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia. 
\v 6 And there the centurion, finding a ship of Alexandria about to sail for Italy, put us on board of it. 
\v 7 And sailing slowly some days, and having with difficulty arrived over against Cnidus, the wind not permitting us to put in, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone; 
\v 8 and coasting along it with difficulty we came to a place called Fair Havens, near which was the city Lasea. 
\v 9 And much time having been spent, and the voyage being now dangerous, because the Fast had already gone by, Paul advised them, 
\v 10 saying, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with injury and much loss, not only of the lading and the ship, but also of our lives. 
\v 11 But the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship more than what was spoken by Paul. 
\v 12 And as the harbor was not well situated for wintering, the greater part advised to sail thence also, if by any means they might reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete, looking toward the southwest and northwest, and there winter. 
\v 13 And when a south wind blew gently, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor, and coasted along close by Crete. 
\v 14 But not long after, there rushed against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon. 
\v 15 And the ship being caught, and unable to face the wind, we gave up to it, and were driven along. 
\v 16 And running under a certain small island called Clauda, we were hardly able to get possession of the boat; 
\v 17 which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and fearing lest they should run into the Syrtis, they lowered the sail and so were driven. 
\v 18 And as we were violently tempest-tossed, the next day they began to lighten the vessel; 
\v 19 and the third day we cast out with our own hands the movables of the ship. 
\v 20 And as neither sun nor stars had appeared for many days, and no small tempest lay on us, thenceforward all hope that we should be saved was taken away. 
\v 21 And after there had been much abstinence from food, Paul stood up in the midst of them and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened to me, and not have put to sea from Crete, nod thus brought upon yourselves this injury and loss. 
\v 22 And now I exhort you to be of good cheer; for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship. 
\v 23 For there stood by me this night an angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve, 
\v 24 saying, Fear not, Paul! Thou must stand before Caesar; and lo, God hath given thee all those that sail with thee. 
\v 25 Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer; for I believe God, that it will be just as it hath been told me. 
\v 26 But we must be cast upon some island. 
\v 27 And when the fourteenth night had come on, as we were driven onward in the Adriatic sea, about midnight the sailors suspected that they were near some country; 
\v 28 and sounding, they found twenty fathoms; and having gone a little further and sounded again, they found fifteen fathoms; 
\v 29 then fearing lest we should fall upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for day. 
\v 30 And as the sailors were seeking means to escape from the ship, when they had lowered the boat into the sea, under the pretence that they were about to carry out anchors from the foreship, 
\v 31 Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, If these men do not stay in the ship, ye cannot be saved. 
\v 32 Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let it fall off. 
\v 33 And while the day was coming on, Paul exhorted them all to take food; saying, This is the fourteenth day that ye have waited, and continued fasting, having taken nothing. 
\v 34 Wherefore I exhort you to take food; for this is for your safety; for there shall not a hair be lost from the head of one of you. 
\v 35 And having thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all, and having broken it, he began to eat. 
\v 36 Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took food. 
\v 37 And there were of us in the ship in all two hundred and seventy-six souls. 
\v 38 And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, casting out the grain into the sea. 
\v 39 And when it was day, they did not know the land; but they observed a certain creek having a beach, into which they determined, if possible, to run the ship. 
\v 40 And cutting away the anchors, they left them in the sea, and at the same time unfastening the rudder-bands, and hoisting the foresail to the wind, they made toward the beach. 
\v 41 And falling into a place having the sea on both sides, they ran the ship aground; and the prow stuck fast, and remained immovable, but the stern was breaking to pieces with the violence [[of the waves]]. 
\v 42 And on the part of the soldiers there was a plan to kill the prisoners, lest any one should swim out and escape. 
\v 43 But the centurion, wishing to save Paul, kept them from their purpose, and ordered those who could swim to cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land, 
\v 44 and the rest, some on boards, and others on something from the ship. And in this way it came to pass, that they all escaped safe to land. 
\c 28  
\p
\v 1 And having escaped, we learned that the island was called Melita. 
\v 2 And the barbarians showed us no little kindness; for they kindled a fire, and received us all, because of the rain which had come on, and because of the cold. 
\v 3 And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid it on the fire, there came forth a viper by reason of the heat, and fastened on his hand. 
\v 4 And when the barbarians saw the animal hanging from his hand, they said to one another, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom though he hath escaped the sea, Justice hath not permitted to live. 
\v 5 He, however, shaking off the animal into the fire suffered no harm. 
\v 6 But they were looking for his becoming swollen, or suddenly falling down dead. But after looking a great while, and seeing no harm come to him they changed their minds, and said that he was a god. 
\v 7 And in the neighborhood of that place were lands be longing to the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who welcomed us, and entertained us kindly three days. 
\v 8 And it happened that the father of Publius was lying sick with a fever and dysentery; to whom Paul went in, and, when he had prayed, laid his hands on him, and healed him. 
\v 9 And when this was done, the others also who had diseases in the island came, and were healed; 
\v 10 who also honored us with many honors, and when we put to sea, loaded us with such things as were necessary. 
\v 11 And after three months we put to sea in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the island, whose sign was Castor and Pollux. 
\v 12 And landing at Syracuse, we stayed there three days; 
\v 13 and from thence we made a circuit, and came to Rhegium; and after one day a south wind arose, and we came on the second day to Puteoli, 
\v 14 where we found brethren, and were entreated to remain with them seven days; and so we went toward Rome. 
\v 15 And from thence, the brethren having heard of us came to meet us as far as Appii Forum, and the Three Taverns; at the sight of whom Paul thanked God and took courage. 
\v 16 And when we had come to Rome, Paul was permitted to dwell by himself, with the soldier that guarded him. 
\v 17 And it came to pass that after three days he called together the chief men of the Jews, and when they had met he said to them, Brethren, I, though I had done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, was delivered up a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans; 
\v 18 who, when they had examined me, wished to release me, because I had done nothing deserving death. 
\v 19 But when the Jews spoke against it, I was constrained to appeal to Caesar; not that I had any charge to bring against my nation. 
\v 20 For this reason therefore I have called for you, to see you and speak to you; for it is on account of the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain. 
\v 21 And they said to him, We neither received letters from Judea concerning thee, nor did any one of the brethren that came report or speak any evil of thee. 
\v 22 But we think it proper to hear from thee what thou thinkest; for with regard to this sect, we know that it is everywhere spoken against. 
\v 23 And when they had appointed him a day, many came to him at his lodging; to whom he expounded, and earnestly testified, the kingdom of God, endeavoring to persuade them concerning Jesus both from the Law of Moses, and from the Prophets, from morning till evening. 
\v 24 And some believed the things spoken, and some believed not. 
\v 25 So, disagreeing with one another, they took their departure, after Paul had spoken one word: Well did the Holy Spirit speak through Isaiah the prophet to your fathers, 
\v 26 saying, “Go to this people, and say, 'Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see and not perceive. 
\v 27 For the heart of this people hath become gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart and turn from their ways, and I should heal them.'” 
\v 28 Be it therefore known to you, that to the gentiles this salvation of God hath been sent; they, moreover, will hear. 
\v 29  
\v 30 And he abode two whole years in his own hired house and gladly received all that came in to him, 
\v 31 proclaiming the kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, without hindrance from any one.
