\v 1 The proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel: 
\v 2 That one may learn wisdom and instruction, And receive words of understanding; 
\v 3 That one may gain the instruction of prudence, Justice, equity, and uprightness; 
\v 4 Which will give caution to the simple, To the young man wisdom and discretion; 
\v 5 Let the wise man hear, and he will increase his knowledge, And the man of understanding will gain wise counsels; 
\v 6 So as to understand a proverb and a deep maxim, The words of the wise and their dark sayings. 
\v 7 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; Fools despise wisdom and instruction. 
\v 8 Hear, O my son! the instruction of thy father, And neglect not the teaching of thy mother! 
\v 9 For they shall be a graceful wreath for thy head, And a chain around thy neck. 
\v 10 My son, if sinners entice thee, Consent thou not! 
\v 11 If they say, “Come with us, Let us lie in wait for blood, Let us lurk secretly for him who is innocent in vain; 
\v 12 Let us swallow them up alive, like the underworld, Yea, in full health, as those that go down into the pit; 
\v 13 We shall find all kinds of precious substance, We shall fill our houses with spoil; 
\v 14 Thou shalt cast thy lot among us; We will all have one purse;”— 
\v 15 My son, walk thou not in their way, Refrain thy foot from their path! 
\v 16 For their feet run to evil, And make haste to shed blood. 
\v 17 For as the net is spread in vain Before the eyes of any bird, 
\v 18 So they lie in wait for their own blood; They lurk secretly for their own lives. 
\v 19 Such are the ways of every one greedy of unjust gain; It taketh away the life of the possessor thereof. 
\v 20 Wisdom crieth out in the highway; In the market-place she uttereth her voice; 
\v 21 At the head of the noisy streets she crieth aloud; At the entrances of the gates, throughout the city, she proclaimeth her words [[saying]]: 
\v 22 How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? How long will scoffers delight themselves in scoffing, And fools hate knowledge? 
\v 23 Turn ye at my reproof! Behold, I will pour out my spirit to you; I will make known my words to you! 
\v 24 “Because I have called, and ye have refused,—Because I have stretched out my hand, and no one hath regarded. 
\v 25 Because ye have rejected all my counsel, And have slighted my rebuke,— 
\v 26 I also will laugh at your calamity, I will mock when your fear cometh; 
\v 27 When your fear cometh upon you like a storm. And destruction overtaketh you like a whirlwind, When distress and anguish come upon you. 
\v 28 Then will they call upon me, but I will not answer! They will seek me early, But they shall not find me! 
\v 29 Because they have hated knowledge, And have not chosen the fear of the LORD,— 
\v 30 Because they would not attend to my counsel, And have despised all my reproof,— 
\v 31 Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, And be filled to the full with their own devices; 
\v 32 Yea, the turning away of the simple shall slay them, And the carelessness of fools shall destroy them. 
\v 33 But whoso hearkeneth to me shall dwell securely, And shall not be disquieted with the fear of evil.” 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 Oh, my son, that thou wouldst receive my words, And treasure up my precepts within thee; 
\v 2 That thou wouldst apply thine ear to wisdom, And incline thy heart to understanding! 
\v 3 For if thou wilt call aloud to knowledge, And lift up thy voice to understanding,— 
\v 4 If thou wilt seek her as silver, And search for her as for hidden treasures, 
\v 5 Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, And find the knowledge of God. 
\v 6 For the LORD giveth wisdom; From his mouth proceed knowledge and understanding: 
\v 7 He layeth up safety for the righteous; He is a shield to them that walk uprightly: 
\v 8 He guardeth the paths of equity, And defendeth the way of his servants. 
\v 9 Then shalt thou understand righteousness and equity And uprightness, yea, every good path. 
\v 10 When wisdom entereth into thy heart, And knowledge is pleasant to thy soul, 
\v 11 Discretion will guard thee, Understanding will preserve thee. 
\v 12 It will deliver thee from the way of the wicked, From the men who speak perverse things; 
\v 13 Who forsake the paths of uprightness, To walk in the ways of darkness; 
\v 14 Who rejoice in doing evil, And delight in the perverseness of the wicked; 
\v 15 Whose paths are crooked, And who are froward in their ways. 
\v 16 It will deliver thee from the wife of another, From the stranger, who useth smooth words; 
\v 17 Who forsaketh the friend of her youth, And forgetteth the covenant of her God. 
\v 18 For her house sinketh down to Death, And her paths to the shades of the dead: 
\v 19 None that go to her return again; They will not attain the paths of life. 
\v 20 Therefore walk thou in the way of good men, And keep the paths of the righteous: 
\v 21 For the upright shall dwell in the land, And the righteous shall remain in it; 
\v 22 But the wicked shall be cut off from the land, And transgressors shall be rooted out of it. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 My son, forget not my teaching, And let thy heart observe my precepts! 
\v 2 For length of days, and years of life, And peace shall they multiply to thee. 
\v 3 Let not kindness and truth forsake thee; Bind them around thy neck, Write them upon the tablet of thy heart: 
\v 4 Then shalt thou find favor and good success In the sight of God and man. 
\v 5 Trust in the LORD with all thy heart, And lean not on thine own understanding; 
\v 6 In all thy ways acknowledge him, And he will make thy paths plain. 
\v 7 Be not wise in thine own eyes; Fear the LORD, and depart from evil. 
\v 8 It shall be health to thy muscles, And moisture to thy bones. 
\v 9 Honor the LORD with thy substance, And with the first-fruits of all thy increase; 
\v 10 So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, And thy vats overflow with new wine. 
\v 11 My son, despise not the correction of the LORD, Nor be impatient under his chastisement! 
\v 12 For whom the LORD loveth he chasteneth, Even as a father the son in whom he delighteth. 
\v 13 Happy the man who findeth wisdom; Yea, the man who getteth understanding! 
\v 14 For the profit thereof is greater than that of silver, And the gain thereof than that of fine gold. 
\v 15 More precious is she than pearls, And none of thy jewels is to be compared with her. 
\v 16 Length of days is in her right hand; In her left hand are riches and honor. 
\v 17 Her ways are ways of pleasantness, And all her paths are peace. 
\v 18 She is a tree of life to them that lay hold of her, And happy is every one who hath her in his grasp. 
\v 19 The LORD by wisdom founded the earth; By understanding he framed the heavens. 
\v 20 By his knowledge the deep waters were cleft, And the clouds drop down the dew. 
\v 21 My son, let them not depart from thine eyes; Keep sound wisdom and discretion! 
\v 22 For they shall be life to thy soul, And grace to thy neck. 
\v 23 Then shalt thou go on thy way securely, And thy foot shall not stumble; 
\v 24 When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid, Yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet. 
\v 25 Be not thou afraid of sudden alarm, Nor of the storm that is for the wicked, when it cometh; 
\v 26 For the LORD shall be thy confidence; Yea, he will keep thy foot from being taken. 
\v 27 Withhold not kindness from those who need it, When it is in the power of thy hand to do it. 
\v 28 Say not to thy neighbor, “Go, and come again, And to-morrow I will give to thee,” when thou hast it by thee. 
\v 29 Devise not evil against thy neighbor, While he dwelleth securely by thee. 
\v 30 Contend not with a man without cause, When he hath done thee no harm. 
\v 31 Envy not the oppressor, And choose none of his ways. 
\v 32 For the perverse man is the abomination of the LORD, But he is in friendship with the upright. 
\v 33 The curse of the LORD is upon the house of the wicked, But he blesseth the dwelling of the righteous. 
\v 34 Surely the scorners he treadeth scornfully, But giveth favor to the lowly. 
\v 35 The wise shall obtain honor, But fools shall bear off shame. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, And attend, that ye may learn understanding! 
\v 2 For I give you good instruction; Forsake ye not my commandments. 
\v 3 For I was my father's son, A tender and only child in the sight of my mother. 
\v 4 He taught me, and said to me, Let thy heart hold fast my words; Keep my commandments, and live. 
\v 5 Get wisdom, get understanding; Forget not, and depart not from, the words of my mouth. 
\v 6 Forsake her not, and she will guard thee: Love her, and she will preserve thee. 
\v 7 Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore gain wisdom, And with all thy gain, gain understanding. 
\v 8 Exalt her, and she will promote thee; She will bring thee to honor, when thou dost embrace her; 
\v 9 She will give to thy head a graceful wreath, A beautiful crown will she bestow upon thee. 
\v 10 Hear, O my son! and receive my sayings! So shall the years of thy life be many. 
\v 11 I have taught thee the way of wisdom, I have guided thee in the right path. 
\v 12 When thou goest, thy steps shall not be confined; And, when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble. 
\v 13 Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go; Keep her, for she is thy life. 
\v 14 Enter not into the path of the wicked, And go not in the way of evil men; 
\v 15 Avoid it, pass not upon it, Turn from it, and go away. 
\v 16 For they sleep not, unless they have done mischief; Yea, their sleep is taken away, unless they have caused some to fall. 
\v 17 For they eat the bread of wickedness, And drink the wine of violence. 
\v 18 But the path of the righteous is as the light of dawn, Which groweth brighter and brighter unto the perfect day. 
\v 19 The way of the wicked is as thick darkness; They know not at what they stumble. 
\v 20 My son, attend to my words; Incline thine ear to my sayings; 
\v 21 Let them not depart from thine eyes; Keep them in the midst of thy heart! 
\v 22 For they are life to those who find them, And health to all their flesh. 
\v 23 More than any thing which thou watchest, watch thy heart; For from it goeth forth life. 
\v 24 Put away from thee a deceitful mouth, And remove far from thee perverse lips. 
\v 25 Let thine eyes look straight forward, And thine eyelids be directed before thee. 
\v 26 Give heed to the path of thy foot, And let all thy ways be steadfast. 
\v 27 Turn not to the right hand or to the left; Remove thy foot from evil. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 My son, attend to my wisdom. And bow thine ear to my understanding; 
\v 2 That thou mayest keep discretion, And that thy lips may preserve knowledge! 
\v 3 Truly, the lips of a strange woman drop honey, And her mouth is smoother than oil; 
\v 4 But her end is bitter as wormwood, Sharp as a two-edged sword. 
\v 5 Her feet go down to death; Her steps lay hold of the under-world. 
\v 6 That she may not ponder the way of life, Her paths waver when she heedeth it not. 
\v 7 Hear me now, therefore, O children! And turn not away from the words of my mouth! 
\v 8 Remove thy way far from her. And come not nigh the door of her house: 
\v 9 Lest thou give thy bloom to others, And thy years to a cruel one; 
\v 10 Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth, And thine earnings be in the house of an alien; 
\v 11 And lest thou mourn in thy latter end. When thy flesh and thy body are consumed, 
\v 12 And say, “How have I hated instruction! And how hath my heart despised reproof! 
\v 13 I have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, Nor inclined mine ear to my instructors; 
\v 14 I have well-nigh fallen into utter misery; In the midst of the congregation and the assembly.” 
\v 15 Drink water out of thine own cistern. And running water out of thine own well: 
\v 16 So shall thy fountains overflow in the streets, In the wide streets, as streams of water; 
\v 17 They shall belong to thee alone, And not to strangers with thee; 
\v 18 And thy fountain shall be blessed, Yea, thou shalt have joy in the wife of thy youth. 
\v 19 A lovely hind, a graceful doe, Her breasts shall satisfy thee at all times, And thou shalt be always ravished with her love. 
\v 20 Why, then, my son, wilt thou be ravished with a wanton, And embrace the bosom of a stranger? 
\v 21 For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, And he weigheth well all his paths. 
\v 22 His own iniquities shall ensnare the wicked; Yea, he shall be held fast by the cords of his own sins. 
\v 23 He shall die for want of instruction; Yea, through the greatness of his folly he shall stagger. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1 My son, if thou hast become surety for another, If thou hast stricken hands for another, 
\v 2 If thou hast become ensnared by the words of thy mouth, If thou hast been caught by the words of thy mouth, 
\v 3 Do this now, my son, and rescue thyself,—Since thou hast fallen into the hands of thy neighbor,—Go, prostrate thyself, and be urgent with thy neighbor! 
\v 4 Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids; 
\v 5 Rescue thyself, as a roe from the hand, And as a bird from the hand of the fowler. 
\v 6 Go to the ant, O sluggard! Consider her ways, and be wise! 
\v 7 She hath no governor, Nor overseer, nor ruler; 
\v 8 Yet she prepareth in the summer her food, She gathereth in the harvest her meat. 
\v 9 How long wilt thou lie in bed, O sluggard? When wilt thou arise from thy sleep? 
\v 10 “A little sleep,—a little slumber,—A little folding of the hands to rest:” 
\v 11 So shall thy poverty come upon thee like a robber, Yea, thy want, as an armed man! 
\v 12 A worthless wretch is the unrighteous man, Who walketh with a deceitful mouth; 
\v 13 Who winketh with his eyes, Speaketh with his feet, And teacheth with his fingers. 
\v 14 Fraud is in his heart; He deviseth mischief continually; He scattereth contentions. 
\v 15 Therefore shall calamity come upon him suddenly; In a moment shall he be destroyed, and that without remedy; 
\v 16 These six things doth the LORD hate; Yea, seven are an abomination to him: 
\v 17 Lofty eyes, a false tongue, And hands which shed innocent blood; 
\v 18 A heart that contriveth wicked devices; Feet that are swift in running to mischief, 
\v 19 A false witness, that uttereth lies, And him that soweth discord among brethren. 
\v 20 Keep, O my son! the commandment of thy father, And forsake not the precepts of thy mother! 
\v 21 Bind them continually to thy heart, Tie them around thy neck! 
\v 22 When thou goest forth, they shall guide thee; When thou sleepest, they shall watch over thee; And, when thou awakest, they shall talk with thee. 
\v 23 For the commandment is a lamp, and instruction a light; Yea, the rebukes of correction lead to life. 
\v 24 They shall guard thee from the evil woman, From the smooth tongue of the unchaste woman. 
\v 25 Desire not her beauty in thy heart, Nor let her catch thee with her eyelids; 
\v 26 For by a harlot a man is brought to a morsel of bread, And the adulteress layeth snares for the precious life. 
\v 27 Can a man take fire into his bosom, And his clothes not be burned? 
\v 28 Can one walk upon burning coals, And his feet not be scorched? 
\v 29 So is it with him who goeth in to his neighbor's wife; Whoever toucheth her shall not go unpunished. 
\v 30 Men do not overlook a thief, Though he steal to satisfy his appetite, when he is hungry; 
\v 31 If found, he must repay sevenfold, And give up all the substance of his house. 
\v 32 Whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding; He that doeth it destroyeth himself; 
\v 33 Blows and dishonor shall he get, And his reproach shall not be wiped away. 
\v 34 For jealousy is the fury of a man; He will not spare in the day of vengeance; 
\v 35 And he will not pay regard to any ransom, Nor be content, though thou offer many gifts. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1 My son, keep my words, And treasure up my commandments with thee! 
\v 2 Keep my commandments and live! Yea, my teaching, as the apple of thine eye! 
\v 3 Bind them upon thy fingers, Write them upon the tablet of thy heart! 
\v 4 Say unto wisdom, “Thou art my sister!” And call understanding thy near acquaintance; 
\v 5 That they may keep thee from the wife of another, From the stranger, that useth smooth words. 
\v 6 For through the window of my house, Through the lattice I was looking forth, 
\v 7 And I saw among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, A young man void of understanding. 
\v 8 He was passing through the street near her corner, And was going the way to her house, 
\v 9 At twilight, in the evening, At midnight, yea, in the thick darkness. 
\v 10 And, behold, a woman met him, In the attire of a harlot, and subtle of heart,— 
\v 11 One noisy and unruly, Whose feet abide not in her house; 
\v 12 Who is now in the streets, now in the broad places, And lurketh near every corner. 
\v 13 She caught hold of him and kissed him, And with a shameless face said to him, 
\v 14 “Thank-offerings have been upon me, And this day have I performed my vows; 
\v 15 Therefore came I forth to meet thee,—Diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee! 
\v 16 I have spread my bed with coverlets, With tapestry of the thread of Egypt. 
\v 17 I have sprinkled my bed With myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 
\v 18 Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning; Let us solace ourselves with caresses. 
\v 19 For the good-man is not at home; He is gone a long journey; 
\v 20 He hath taken a purse of money with him; At the day of the full moon he will return.” 
\v 21 By her much fair speech she seduced him; By the smoothness of her lips she drew him away. 
\v 22 He goeth after her straightway, As an ox goeth to the slaughter, Or as one in fetters to the chastisement of the fool, 
\v 23 Till an arrow strike through his liver;—As a bird hasteneth into the snare, And knoweth not that it is laid for its life. 
\v 24 Now, therefore, ye children, hearken to me, And attend to the words of my mouth! 
\v 25 Let not thy heart turn aside to her ways; Go not astray in her paths! 
\v 26 For many are the wounded which she hath cast down; Yea, countless is the number of those slain by her. 
\v 27 Her house is the way to the under-world, Leading down to the chambers of death. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1 Doth not wisdom cry aloud, And understanding put forth her voice? 
\v 2 Upon the top of the high places, By the wayside, In the cross-ways, She taketh her station. 
\v 3 By the side of the gates, In the entrance of the city, In the approaches to the doors, she crieth aloud. 
\v 4 “To you, O men! do I call, And my voice is to the sons of men! 
\v 5 O ye simple ones! learn wisdom, And ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart! 
\v 6 Hear, for I speak excellent things, And my lips utter that which is right. 
\v 7 For my mouth speaketh truth, And wickedness is an abomination to my lips. 
\v 8 All the words of my mouth are in uprightness; There is nothing crooked or deceitful in them; 
\v 9 They are all plain to the man of understanding, And right to those who find knowledge. 
\v 10 Receive my instruction, and not silver. And knowledge rather than choice gold! 
\v 11 For wisdom is better than pearls, And no precious things are to be compared with her. 
\v 12 “I, wisdom, dwell with prudence, And find out the knowledge of sagacious counsels. 
\v 13 The fear of the LORD is to hate evil; Pride, and arrogance, and the evil way, And the deceitful mouth, do I hate. 
\v 14 Counsel is mine, and sound reason; I am understanding; I have strength. 
\v 15 By me kings reign, And princes decree justice. 
\v 16 By me princes rule, And nobles, even all the judges of the earth. 
\v 17 I love them that love me, And they who seek me early shall find me. 
\v 18 Riches and honor are with me; Yea, durable riches and prosperity. 
\v 19 My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold. And my revenue than choice silver. 
\v 20 I walk in the way of righteousness, In the midst of the paths of equity. 
\v 21 I cause those who love me to possess substance; Yea, I fill their treasuries. 
\v 22 “The LORD created me, the firstling of his course, Before his works, of old; 
\v 23 I was anointed from everlasting, From the beginning, even before the earth was made. 
\v 24 When as yet there were no deeps, I was brought forth. When there were no springs, abounding with water. 
\v 25 Before the mountains were settled, Yea, before the hills, I was brought forth; 
\v 26 Ere yet he had made the land and the wastes, And the first of the clods of the earth. 
\v 27 When he framed the heavens, I was there; When he drew a circle upon the face of the deep; 
\v 28 When he made firm the sky above, And the fountains of the deep rushed forth; 
\v 29 When he gave to the sea its bounds, that the waters should not pass their border; When he marked out the foundations of the earth,— 
\v 30 Then was I by him as a master-builder; I was his delight day by day, Exulting before him at all times; 
\v 31 Exulting in the habitable part of his earth, And my delight was with the sons of men. 
\v 32 “Now, therefore, ye children, hearken to me! For happy are they who keep my ways! 
\v 33 Hear instruction, and be wise! Yea, reject it not! 
\v 34 Happy the man who hearkeneth to me, Who watcheth day by day at my gates, Who waiteth at the posts of my doors; 
\v 35 For he that findeth me findeth life, And obtaineth favor from the LORD; 
\v 36 But he who misseth me doeth violence to himself; All they who hate me love death.” 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 Wisdom hath builded her house; She hath hewn out her seven pillars. 
\v 2 She hath killed her fatlings; She hath mingled her wine; Yea, she hath furnished her table. 
\v 3 She hath sent forth her maidens; She crieth aloud upon the highest places of the city: 
\v 4 “Whoever is simple, let him turn in hither!” To him that is void of understanding she saith, 
\v 5 “Come, eat of my bread, And drink of the wine which I have mingled! 
\v 6 Forsake folly, and live! And go forward in the way of understanding! 
\v 7 “He who correcteth a scoffer Bringeth shame upon himself; And he who rebuketh the wicked Bringeth upon himself a stain. 
\v 8 Rebuke not a scoffer, lest he hate thee; Rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee. 
\v 9 Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser; Teach a righteous man, and he will increase his learning. 
\v 10 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, And the knowledge of the Most Holy is understanding. 
\v 11 Yea, through me thy days shall be multiplied, And the years of thy life shall be increased. 
\v 12 If thou art wise, thou art wise for thyself; And if thou art a scoffer, thou alone must bear it.” 
\v 13 The foolish woman is clamorous; She is very simple, and careth for nothing. 
\v 14 She sitteth at the door of her house, Upon a seat in the high places of the city, 
\v 15 To call aloud to those that pass by, Who go straight forward in their ways, 
\v 16 “Whoever is simple, let him turn in hither!” And to him that is void of understanding she saith, 
\v 17 “Stolen water is sweet, And bread eaten in secret is pleasant.” 
\v 18 But he considereth not that the dead are there, That in the vales of the under-world are her guests. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1 The Proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father, But a foolish son is the grief of his mother. 
\v 2 Treasures of wickedness do not profit; But righteousness delivereth from death. 
\v 3 The LORD will not suffer the righteous to famish; But he disappointeth the craving of the wicked. 
\v 4 He that worketh with a slack hand becometh poor; But the hand of the diligent maketh rich. 
\v 5 He that gathereth in summer is a wise son; But he that sleepeth in harvest is a son causing shame. 
\v 6 Blessings are upon the head of the just; But the mouth of the wicked concealeth violence. 
\v 7 The memory of the righteous man shall be blessed; But the name of the wicked shall rot. 
\v 8 He who is wise in heart receiveth precepts; But the foolish talker falleth headlong. 
\v 9 He that walketh uprightly walketh securely; But he that perverteth his ways shall be punished. 
\v 10 He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow; And a foolish talker falleth headlong. 
\v 11 The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life; But the mouth of the wicked concealeth violence. 
\v 12 Hatred stirreth up strife; But love covereth all offences. 
\v 13 Upon the lips of a man of understanding wisdom is found; But a rod is for the back of him that lacketh understanding. 
\v 14 Wise men treasure up knowledge; But the mouth of the foolish is destruction close at hand. 
\v 15 The rich man's wealth is his strong city; The destruction of the poor is their poverty. 
\v 16 The earnings of the righteous minister to life; The revenues of the wicked, to sin. 
\v 17 He that keepeth instruction is in the path of life; But he that refuseth reproof goeth astray. 
\v 18 He that hideth hatred hath lying lips; And he that uttereth slander is a fool. 
\v 19 In the multitude of words there wanteth not offence; But he who restraineth his lips is wise. 
\v 20 The tongue of the righteous is as choice silver; The understanding of the wicked is of little worth. 
\v 21 The lips of the righteous feed many; But fools die through want of wisdom. 
\v 22 It is the blessing of the LORD that maketh rich, And he addeth no sorrow with it. 
\v 23 It is as sport to a fool to do mischief; But a man of understanding hath wisdom. 
\v 24 The fear of the wicked shall come upon him; But the desire of the righteous shall be granted. 
\v 25 When the whirlwind passeth by, the wicked is no more; But the righteous is an everlasting foundation. 
\v 26 As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, So is the sluggard to them that send him. 
\v 27 The fear of the LORD prolongeth life; But the years of the wicked shall be shortened. 
\v 28 The hope of the righteous shall be gladness: But the expectation of the wicked shall come to nothing. 
\v 29 The way of the LORD is a stronghold for the upright, But destruction for those who do iniquity. 
\v 30 The righteous shall never be moved; But the wicked shall not dwell in the land. 
\v 31 The mouth of the righteous man yieldeth wisdom; But the perverse tongue shall be cut off. 
\v 32 The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable; But the mouth of the wicked what is perverse. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 False scales are an abomination to the LORD; But a perfect weight is his delight. 
\v 2 When pride cometh, then cometh disgrace; But with the humble is wisdom. 
\v 3 The integrity of the upright shall guide them; But the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them. 
\v 4 Riches do not profit in the day of wrath; But righteousness delivereth from death. 
\v 5 The righteousness of the good man maketh his way plain; But the wicked falleth through his wickedness. 
\v 6 The righteousness of the upright delivereth them; But transgressors are ensnared in their own mischief. 
\v 7 When the wicked man dieth, his hope cometh to an end; Yea, the expectation of the unjust cometh to an end. 
\v 8 The righteous man is delivered from trouble, And the wicked cometh into it in his stead. 
\v 9 By his mouth the vile man destroyeth his neighbor; But by the knowledge of the righteous are men delivered. 
\v 10 When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth; And when the wicked perish, there is shouting. 
\v 11 By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted; But it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked. 
\v 12 He who despiseth his neighbor is void of understanding; A man of discernment holdeth his peace. 
\v 13 He who goeth about as a tale-bearer revealeth secrets; But he who is of a faithful spirit concealeth a matter. 
\v 14 Where there is no counsel, the people fall; But in a multitude of counsellors there is safety. 
\v 15 He that is surety for another shall smart for it; But he that hateth suretyship is sure. 
\v 16 A graceful woman obtaineth honor, Even as strong men obtain riches. 
\v 17 He that doeth good to himself is a man of kindness; But he that tormenteth his own flesh is cruel. 
\v 18 The wicked toileth for deceitful wages; But he who soweth righteousness shall have a sure reward. 
\v 19 As righteousness tendeth to life, So he who pursueth evil pursueth it to his death. 
\v 20 The perverse in heart are the abomination of the LORD; But the upright in their way are his delight. 
\v 21 From generation to generation the wicked shall not go unpunished; But the posterity of the righteous shall be delivered. 
\v 22 As a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, So is a beautiful woman who is without discretion. 
\v 23 The desire of the righteous is only good; But the expectation of the wicked is wrath. 
\v 24 There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; And there is that withholdeth more than is right, yet he cometh to want. 
\v 25 The bountiful man shall be enriched, And he that watereth shall himself be watered. 
\v 26 Him that keepeth back corn the people curse; But blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it. 
\v 27 He, who earnestly seeketh good, seeketh favor; But he that seeketh mischief, it shall come upon him. 
\v 28 He who trusteth in his riches shall fall; But the righteous shall flourish as a leaf. 
\v 29 He that harasseth his household shall inherit wind; And the fool shall be the servant of the wise. 
\v 30 The fruit of a righteous man is a tree of life; And the wise man winneth souls. 
\v 31 Behold, the righteous man is requited on the earth; Much more the wicked man and the sinner! 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 He who loveth correction loveth knowledge; But he who hateth rebuke remaineth stupid. 
\v 2 The good man obtaineth favor from the LORD; But the man of wicked devices he condemneth. 
\v 3 A man shall not be established by wickedness; But the root of the righteous shall not be moved. 
\v 4 A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband; But she who causeth shame is as rottenness in his bones. 
\v 5 The purposes of the righteous are just; The designs of the wicked are deceitful. 
\v 6 The words of the wicked lie in wait for men's blood; But the mouth of the upright delivereth them. 
\v 7 The wicked are overthrown, and are no more; But the house of the righteous shall stand. 
\v 8 A man will be commended according to his wisdom; But he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised. 
\v 9 Better is he that demeaneth himself, and hath a servant, Than he that exalteth himself, and hath no bread. 
\v 10 The righteous man careth for the life of his beast; But the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel. 
\v 11 He who tilleth his own land shall be satisfied with bread; But he who followeth worthless persons is void of understanding. 
\v 12 The wicked man longeth after the prey of evil-doers; But the root of the righteous yieldeth fruit. 
\v 13 In the transgression of the lips is a dangerous snare; But the righteous man shall escape from trouble. 
\v 14 By the fruit of a man's mouth he shall be filled with good, And the recompense of a man's hands shall be rendered unto him. 
\v 15 The way of a fool is right in his own eyes; But he that hearkeneth to counsel is wise. 
\v 16 A fool's wrath is instantly known; But he that hideth insult is wise. 
\v 17 He that speaketh truth testifieth what is right; But a false witness, deceit. 
\v 18 There is who babbleth like the piercing of a sword; But the tongue of the wise is health. 
\v 19 The lip of truth shall be established for ever; But the tongue of falsehood, but for a moment. 
\v 20 Deceit is in the heart of those who contrive evil; But to the counsellors of peace shall be joy. 
\v 21 No evil shall happen to the righteous; But the wicked shall be filled with calamity. 
\v 22 False lips are the abomination of the LORD; But they who deal truly are his delight. 
\v 23 A prudent man concealeth his knowledge; Bur the heart of fools proclaimeth their foolishness. 
\v 24 The hand of the diligent shall bear rule; But the slothful shall be under tribute. 
\v 25 Anxiety in the heart of a man boweth it down; But a kind word maketh it glad. 
\v 26 The righteous showeth the way to his neighbor; But the way of the wicked leadeth them astray. 
\v 27 The slothful man shall not roast his game; But a precious treasure to any man is he that is diligent. 
\v 28 In the path of righteousness is life, And in her pathway there is no death. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 A wise son listeneth to the instruction of his father; But a scoffer listeneth not to rebuke. 
\v 2 By the fruit of a man's mouth he shall eat good; But the appetite of transgressors shall be sated with violence. 
\v 3 He who keepeth his mouth keepeth his life; But destruction shall be to him who openeth wide his lips. 
\v 4 The appetite of the sluggard longeth, and hath nothing; But the appetite of the diligent is fully satisfied. 
\v 5 A righteous man hateth words of falsehood; But a wicked man causeth disgrace and shame. 
\v 6 Righteousness preserveth him who is upright in his way; But wickedness overthroweth the sinner. 
\v 7 There is who maketh himself rich, yet hath nothing, Who maketh himself poor, yet hath great riches. 
\v 8 A man's wealth is the ransom of his life; But the poor man heareth no threatenings. 
\v 9 The light of the righteous shall rejoice; But the lamp of the wicked shall be put out. 
\v 10 By pride cometh only contention; But with the well-advised is wisdom. 
\v 11 Wealth gotten by vanity will become small; But he who gathereth it into the hand increaseth it. 
\v 12 Hope deferred maketh the heart sick; But the desire accomplished is a tree of life. 
\v 13 He that despiseth the word shall be destroyed; But he who revereth the commandment shall be rewarded. 
\v 14 The instruction of the wise is a fountain of life; By it men escape from the snares of death. 
\v 15 A good understanding winneth favor; But the way of transgressors is hard. 
\v 16 Every prudent man acteth with knowledge; But a fool spreadeth abroad his folly. 
\v 17 A wicked messenger falleth into trouble; But a faithful ambassador is health. 
\v 18 Poverty and shame are for him who rejecteth instruction; But he that regardeth reproof shall come to honor. 
\v 19 The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul; But it is an abomination to fools to depart from evil. 
\v 20 He who walketh with wise men shall be wise; But the companion of fools shall be destroyed. 
\v 21 Calamity pursueth the wicked; But the righteous is rewarded with good. 
\v 22 The good man leaveth his substance to his children's children; But the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just. 
\v 23 There is much food from the fallow-ground of the poor; But there is who is brought low for want of uprightness. 
\v 24 He that spareth the rod hateth his son; But he who loveth him chasteneth him early. 
\v 25 The righteous man eateth to the satisfying of his desire; But the stomach of the wicked suffereth want. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1 The wise woman buildeth her house; But the foolish teareth it down with her hands. 
\v 2 He who walketh in uprightness feareth the LORD; But he who is perverse in his ways despiseth him. 
\v 3 In the mouth of the foolish pride is a scourge; But the lips of the wise preserve them. 
\v 4 Where there are no oxen, the crib is clean; But there is great increase by the strength of the ox. 
\v 5 A faithful witness doth not lie; But a false witness poureth forth lies. 
\v 6 The scoffer seeketh wisdom, and findeth it not; But knowledge is easy to the man of understanding. 
\v 7 Go from the presence of a foolish man; For thou hast not perceived in him the lips of knowledge. 
\v 8 The wisdom of the prudent is in giving heed to his way; But the folly of fools is deceit. 
\v 9 Fools make a mock at sin; But with the upright is favor. 
\v 10 The heart knoweth its own bitterness. And a stranger cannot intermeddle with its joy. 
\v 11 The house of the wicked shall be destroyed; But the tent of the upright shall flourish. 
\v 12 There is a way which seemeth right to a man, But its end is the way to death. 
\v 13 Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful, And the end of joy is grief. 
\v 14 The perverse in heart shall be filled with his own ways; And from himself shall the good man be satisfied. 
\v 15 The simple man believeth every word; But the prudent looketh well to his steps. 
\v 16 The wise man feareth, and departeth from evil; But the fool is haughty and confident. 
\v 17 He who is hasty in his anger will commit folly; And the man of wicked devices will be hated. 
\v 18 The simple inherit folly; But the prudent are crowned with knowledge. 
\v 19 The evil bow before the good; Yea, the wicked at the gates of the righteous. 
\v 20 The poor is hated even by his own neighbor; But the rich hath many friends. 
\v 21 He who despiseth his neighbor sinneth; But happy is he who hath mercy on the poor. 
\v 22 Do not they who devise evil fail of their end? But they who devise good meet with kindness and truth. 
\v 23 In all labor there is profit; But the talk of the lips tendeth only to penury. 
\v 24 Riches are a crown to the wise; But the promotion of fools is folly. 
\v 25 A true witness saveth lives; But a deceitful witness poureth forth lies. 
\v 26 In the fear of the LORD is strong confidence; Yea, to his children he will be a refuge. 
\v 27 The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life; By it men escape from the snares of death. 
\v 28 In a numerous people is the glory of a king; But the want of people is the destruction of a prince. 
\v 29 He who is slow to anger is of great understanding. But he who is of a hasty spirit setteth folly on high. 
\v 30 A quiet heart is the life of the flesh; But the ferment of passion is rottenness to the bones. 
\v 31 He who oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker; But he who hath mercy on the poor honoreth him. 
\v 32 By his wickedness the wicked is thrust down; But the righteous hath hope even in death. 
\v 33 Wisdom resteth quietly in the heart of the wise; But in the breast of fools it will be made known. 
\v 34 Righteousness exalteth a people; But the reproach of nations is sin. 
\v 35 The king's favor is toward a wise servant; But his wrath is against him that causeth shame. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1 A soft answer turneth away wrath; But harsh words stir up anger. 
\v 2 The tongue of the wise maketh knowledge pleasing; But the mouth of fools poureth forth folly. 
\v 3 The eyes of the LORD are in every place; They behold the evil and the good. 
\v 4 A mild tongue is a tree of life; But perverseness therein is a wound in the spirit. 
\v 5 The fool despiseth the correction of his father; But he that regardeth reproof is prudent. 
\v 6 In the house of the righteous is much wealth; But in the revenues of the wicked there is trouble. 
\v 7 The lips of the wise spread abroad knowledge; But the heart of the foolish is not sound. 
\v 8 The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD; But the prayer of the righteous is his delight. 
\v 9 The way of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD; But him who followeth after righteousness he loveth. 
\v 10 Sore chastisement shall be to him that forsaketh the way; He that hateth reproof shall die. 
\v 11 The underworld, yea, the region of death, is before the LORD; How much more the hearts of the sons of men! 
\v 12 The scoffer loveth not his reprover; He will not resort to the wise. 
\v 13 A joyous heart maketh a bright countenance; But by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken. 
\v 14 The heart of the man of understanding seeketh knowledge; But the mouth of fools feedeth on folly. 
\v 15 The days of the afflicted are all evil; But he that hath a cheerful heart hath a continual feast. 
\v 16 Better is a little, with the fear of the LORD, Than much treasure, and trouble therewith. 
\v 17 Better is a dinner of herbs, where there is love, Than a fatted ox, and hatred therewith. 
\v 18 The passionate man stirreth up strife; But he who is slow to anger appeaseth strife. 
\v 19 The way of the slothful is as a hedge of thorns; But the way of the righteous is a highway. 
\v 20 A wise son maketh a glad father; But a foolish man despiseth his mother. 
\v 21 Folly is joy to him who lacketh wisdom; But the man of understanding walketh uprightly. 
\v 22 Without counsel, plans come to nought; But with a multitude of counsellors they are established. 
\v 23 A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth; And a word in due season, how good it is! 
\v 24 The path of life is upward for the wise, So that he turneth away from the underworld beneath. 
\v 25 The LORD destroyeth the house of the proud; But he will establish the border of the widow. 
\v 26 Evil devices are an abomination to the LORD; But pleasant words are pure. 
\v 27 He who is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; But he who hateth bribes shall live. 
\v 28 The heart of the righteous meditateth on his answer; But the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things. 
\v 29 The LORD is far from the wicked: But he heareth the prayer of the righteous. 
\v 30 The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart, And good tidings make the bones fat. 
\v 31 The ear that hearkeneth to the reproof of life Shall dwell among the wise. 
\v 32 He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own life; But he that hearkeneth to rebuke getteth understanding. 
\v 33 The fear of the LORD guideth to wisdom, And before honor is humility. 
\c 16  
\p
\v 1 To man belongeth the preparation of the heart; But the answer of the tongue is from the LORD. 
\v 2 All the ways of a man are pure in his own eyes; But the LORD weigheth the spirit. 
\v 3 Commit thy doings to the LORD, And thy purposes shall be established. 
\v 4 The LORD hath ordained every thing for its end; Yea, even the wicked for the day of evil. 
\v 5 Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the LORD; From generation to generation he shall not be unpunished. 
\v 6 Through kindness and truth, iniquity is expiated; And, through the fear of the LORD, men depart from evil. 
\v 7 When a man's ways please the LORD, He maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him. 
\v 8 Better is a little with righteousness, Than great revenues without right. 
\v 9 The heart of man deviseth his way, But the LORD establisheth his steps. 
\v 10 A divine sentence is upon the lips of a king; His mouth transgresseth not in judgment. 
\v 11 A just balance and scales are the appointment of the LORD; All the weights of the bag are his work. 
\v 12 The doing of wickedness is an abomination to kings; For by righteousness is the throne established. 
\v 13 Righteous lips are the delight of kings, And they love him who speaketh right things. 
\v 14 The wrath of a king is messengers of death; But a wise man will pacify it. 
\v 15 In the light of the king's countenance is life, And his favor is a like a cloud bringing the latter rain. 
\v 16 How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! Yea, to get understanding is rather to be chosen than silver. 
\v 17 It is the highway of the upright to depart from evil; He that taketh heed to his way preserveth his life. 
\v 18 Pride goeth before destruction, And a haughty spirit before a fall. 
\v 19 Better is it to be of a humble spirit with the lowly, Than to share the spoil with the proud. 
\v 20 He who giveth heed to the word shall find good; And he who trusteth in the LORD, happy is he! 
\v 21 The wise in heart shall be called intelligent, And sweetness of the lips increaseth learning. 
\v 22 Understanding is a wellspring of life to him that hath it. And the chastisement of fools is their folly. 
\v 23 The heart of the wise man instructeth his mouth, And addeth learning to his lips. 
\v 24 Pleasant words are like a honeycomb, Sweet to the taste, and health to the bones. 
\v 25 There is a way that seemeth right to a man, But the end thereof is the way to death. 
\v 26 The hunger of the laborer laboreth for him; For his mouth urgeth him on. 
\v 27 A worthless man diggeth mischief, And on his lips there is, as it were, a burning fire. 
\v 28 A deceitful man stirreth up strife, And a whisperer separateth friends. 
\v 29 A man of violence enticeth his neighbor, And leadeth him into a way which is not good. 
\v 30 He who shutteth his eyes to devise fraud, He who compresseth his lips, hath accomplished mischief! 
\v 31 The hoary head is a crown of glory, If it be found in the way of righteousness. 
\v 32 He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty; And he who ruleth his spirit, than he that taketh a city. 
\v 33 The lot is cast into the lap; But the whole decision thereof is from the LORD. 
\c 17  
\p
\v 1 Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, Than a house full of flesh-banquets with strife. 
\v 2 A prudent servant shall rule over a son who causeth shame; Yea, with brothers he shall share the inheritance. 
\v 3 The refining-pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold; But the LORD trieth hearts. 
\v 4 An evil-doer listeneth to mischievous lips; And a liar giveth ear to a destructive tongue. 
\v 5 Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker; He that is glad at calamities shall not go unpunished. 
\v 6 Children's children are the crown of the aged, And their fathers the glory of sons. 
\v 7 Excellent speech becometh not the base; How much less lying lips the noble! 
\v 8 A gift is a precious stone in the eyes of him who taketh it; Whithersoever it turneth it hath success. 
\v 9 He who covereth an offence seeketh love; But he who recurreth to a matter removeth a friend. 
\v 10 A reproof will penetrate deeper into a wise man Than a hundred stripes into a fool. 
\v 11 An evil man seeketh only rebellion; Therefore shall a cruel messenger be sent against him. 
\v 12 Let a man meet a bear robbed of her whelps, Rather than a fool in his folly. 
\v 13 Whoso returneth evil for good, Evil shall not depart from his house. 
\v 14 The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water; Therefore leave off contention before it rolleth onward. 
\v 15 He that justifieth the wicked, And he that condemneth the just, Both alike are an abomination to the LORD. 
\v 16 Why should a price be in the hand of a fool To get wisdom, seeing he hath no sense? 
\v 17 A friend loveth at all times; But in adversity he is born a brother. 
\v 18 A man who lacketh understanding striketh hands, And becometh surety in the presence of his friend. 
\v 19 He who loveth strife loveth transgression; He who raiseth high his gate seeketh ruin. 
\v 20 He that is of a deceitful heart shall find no good; And he that turneth about with his tongue shall fall into mischief. 
\v 21 Whoso begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow; Yea, the father of the fool hath no joy. 
\v 22 A merry heart doeth good to the body; But a broken spirit drieth up the bones. 
\v 23 The wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom, To pervert the ways of judgment. 
\v 24 Wisdom is before the face of him that hath understanding; But the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth. 
\v 25 A foolish son is a grief to his father, And bitterness to her that bore him. 
\v 26 Moreover, to punish the righteous is not good, Nor to smite the noble for their equity. 
\v 27 He that spareth his words is imbued with knowledge; And he that is of a cool spirit is a man of understanding. 
\v 28 Even a fool, when he is silent, is accounted wise; He that shutteth his lips is a man of understanding. 
\c 18  
\p
\v 1 He who separateth himself seeketh his own desire; Against all sound discretion he rusheth on. 
\v 2 The fool hath no delight in understanding, But rather in revealing his own mind. 
\v 3 When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt; And with baseness, shame. 
\v 4 The words of a man's mouth are deep waters, And the wellspring of wisdom is an overflowing brook. 
\v 5 It is not good to be partial to the wicked, So as to overthrow the righteous in judgment. 
\v 6 The lips of a fool enter into strife, And his mouth calleth for blows. 
\v 7 A fool's mouth is his destruction, And his lips are a snare for his life. 
\v 8 The words of a talebearer are like sweet morsels; For they go down to the innermost parts of the body. 
\v 9 Moreover, he that is slothful in his work Is brother to him that is a great waster. 
\v 10 The name of the LORD is a strong tower; The righteous runneth to it, and is safe. 
\v 11 The rich man's wealth is his strong city, And as a high wall, in his own conceit. 
\v 12 Before destruction the heart of a man is haughty, And before honor is humility. 
\v 13 He who answereth a matter before he hath heard it, It is folly and shame to him. 
\v 14 The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; But a wounded spirit who can bear? 
\v 15 The heart of the intelligent will acquire knowledge, And the ear of the wise will seek knowledge. 
\v 16 A gift maketh room for a man, And bringeth him into the presence of the great. 
\v 17 He that first pleadeth his cause appeareth just; But his opponent cometh, and searcheth him through. 
\v 18 The lot causeth contentions to cease, And parteth asunder the mighty. 
\v 19 A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city; Yea, their contentions are like the bars of a castle. 
\v 20 With the fruit of a man's mouth shall his stomach be filled; He shall be filled with the produce of his lips. 
\v 21 Death and life are in the power of the tongue; They that love it shall eat its fruit. 
\v 22 He that findeth a wife findeth a blessing, And obtaineth favor from the LORD. 
\v 23 The poor useth entreaties; But the rich answereth roughly. 
\v 24 A man of many friends will show himself false; Yet there is a friend who sticketh closer than a brother. 
\c 19  
\p
\v 1 Better is the poor man who walketh in his integrity, Than he who is of false lips and a fool. 
\v 2 Moreover, that the soul be without knowledge is not good, And he that hasteth with is feet stumbleth. 
\v 3 The folly of man destroyeth his way, And then his heart fretteth against the LORD. 
\v 4 Wealth maketh many friends; But the poor is separated from his neighbor. 
\v 5 A false witness shall not be unpunished, And he that speaketh lies shall not escape. 
\v 6 Many are they who caress the noble, And every one is the friend of him who giveth gifts. 
\v 7 All the brethren of the poor man hate him; How much more do his friends go far from him! He runneth after their words,—they are gone! 
\v 8 He that getteth wisdom loveth himself; He that keepeth understanding shall find good. 
\v 9 A false witness shall not be unpunished, And he that speaketh lies shall perish. 
\v 10 Luxury is not seemly for a fool; Much less should a servant have rule over princes. 
\v 11 A man of understanding is slow to anger; Yea, it is his glory to pass over an offence. 
\v 12 The wrath of a king is like the roaring of a lion; But his favor, like dew upon the grass. 
\v 13 A foolish son is a calamity to his father, And the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping. 
\v 14 Houses and riches are an inheritance from fathers; But a prudent wife is from the LORD. 
\v 15 Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep, And the idle person shall suffer hunger. 
\v 16 He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his life; But he that neglecteth his ways shall die. 
\v 17 He who hath pity on the poor lendeth to the LORD, And that which he giveth will he repay him. 
\v 18 Chasten thy son because there is hope, But let not thy soul desire to slay him. 
\v 19 A man of great wrath will suffer punishment; For if thou deliver him, yet must thou do it again. 
\v 20 Listen to counsel and receive instruction, That thou mayst be wise in thy latter years. 
\v 21 Many are the devices in the heart of a man; But the purpose of the LORD, that shall stand. 
\v 22 The charm of a man is his kindness; And better is a poor man than a liar. 
\v 23 The fear of the LORD tendeth to life, And he that hath it shall abide satisfied; He shall not be visited with evil. 
\v 24 The slothful man dippeth his hand into the dish: He doth not bring it back even to his mouth. 
\v 25 Strike the scoffer, and the simple will become prudent; Reprove a man of understanding, and he will discern knowledge. 
\v 26 The son that causeth shame and disgrace doeth violence to his father, And chaseth away his mother. 
\v 27 Cease, my son, to listen to the instruction That causeth thee to wander from the words of knowledge! 
\v 28 A worthless witness scoffeth at justice, And the mouth of the wicked swalloweth down iniquity. 
\v 29 Punishments are prepared for scoffers, And stripes for the back of fools. 
\c 20  
\p
\v 1 Wine is a mocker, strong drink a brawler, And he that reeleth with it is not wise. 
\v 2 The terror of a king is like the roaring of a lion; He who provoketh him sinneth against himself. 
\v 3 It is an honor to a man to cease from strife; Bur every fool rusheth into it. 
\v 4 The sluggard will not plough by reason of the cold; Therefore shall he beg in harvest, and have nothing. 
\v 5 A design in the heart of a man is like deep waters; But a man of understanding draweth it out. 
\v 6 Many will proclaim their own kindness; But a faithful man who can find? 
\v 7 He who walketh in his integrity is a righteous man; Happy will be his children after him! 
\v 8 The king, sitting upon the throne of judgment, Scattereth with his eyes all the wicked like chaff. 
\v 9 Who can say, “I have kept my heart clean; I am free from my sin?” 
\v 10 Divers weights and divers measures,—Both of them are an abomination to the LORD. 
\v 11 Even in childhood one maketh himself known by his doings, Whether his actions will be pure and right. 
\v 12 The ear that heareth, and the eye that seeth,—The LORD made them both. 
\v 13 Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; Open thine eyes, and thou shalt be satisfied with bread. 
\v 14 “Bad! bad!” saith the buyer; But when he hath gone his way, then he boasteth. 
\v 15 There is gold and abundance of pearls; But the lips of knowledge are a precious vase. 
\v 16 Take his garment who is surety for another; Yea, take a pledge of him who is bound for a stranger. 
\v 17 The bread of falsehood is sweet to a man; But afterwards his mouth is filled with gravel. 
\v 18 Purposes are established by counsel; Therefore with good advice make war. 
\v 19 He who goeth about as a tale-bearer revealeth secrets; Therefore associate not with him who keepeth open his lips. 
\v 20 Whoso curseth his father or his mother, His lamp shall be put out in midnight darkness. 
\v 21 A possession may be gotten hastily in the beginning, But in the end it will not be blessed. 
\v 22 Say not thou, “I will repay evil;” Wait on the LORD, and he will help thee. 
\v 23 Divers weights are an abomination to the LORD, And a false balance is not good. 
\v 24 A man's steps are from the LORD; How, then, can a man understand his way? 
\v 25 It is a snare to a man to utter a vow rashly, And after vows to consider. 
\v 26 A wise king scattereth the wicked like chaff, And bringeth over them the wheel. 
\v 27 The spirit of a man is the lamp of the LORD, Which searcheth all the inner chambers of his body. 
\v 28 Mercy and truth preserve the king; Yea, his throne is upholden by mercy. 
\v 29 The glory of young men is their strength, And the beauty of old men is the gray head. 
\v 30 Wounding stripes are the remedy for a bad man; Yea, stripes which reach to the inner chambers of the body. 
\c 21  
\p
\v 1 As streams of water, So is the heart of the king in the hand of the LORD; He turneth it whithersoever he will. 
\v 2 All the ways of a man are right in his own eyes; But the LORD weigheth the heart. 
\v 3 To do justice and equity Is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice. 
\v 4 The lofty look, the proud heart, The lamp of the wicked, is ruin. 
\v 5 The plans of the diligent tend only to plenty; But the hasty hasteneth only to want. 
\v 6 The getting of treasures by a false tongue Is the fleeting breath of them that seek death. 
\v 7 The rapine of the wicked shall snatch them away, Because they refuse to do justice. 
\v 8 The way of the guilty man is crooked; But he that is pure, his doings are right. 
\v 9 Better is it to dwell in a corner of the housetop Than with a brawling woman in a large house. 
\v 10 The soul of the wicked longeth to do evil; His neighbor findeth no compassion in his eyes. 
\v 11 When the scoffer is punished, the simple is made wise; When the wise man is taught, he receiveth knowledge. 
\v 12 The righteous man hath regard to the house of the wicked; He casteth the wicked headlong into ruin. 
\v 13 Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, He also shall cry aloud, but shall not be heard. 
\v 14 A gift in secret pacifieth anger; And a present in the bosom, strong wrath. 
\v 15 To do justice shall be joy to the righteous; But destruction is for them that do iniquity. 
\v 16 A man who wandereth from the way of discretion Shall rest in the assembly of the dead. 
\v 17 He that loveth pleasure will be a poor man; He that loveth wine and oil will not be rich. 
\v 18 The wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous! And in the room of the upright shall be the transgressor. 
\v 19 It is better to dwell in a desert land Than with a contentious and fretful woman. 
\v 20 Precious treasure and oil are in the dwelling of the wise; But the foolish man swalloweth them up. 
\v 21 He who followeth after righteousness and mercy Shall find life, prosperity, and honor. 
\v 22 A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty, And bringeth down the strength in which it trusted. 
\v 23 Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue Keepeth his soul from trouble. 
\v 24 The proud and haughty,—scoffer is his name; He acteth with haughty arrogance. 
\v 25 The desire of the sluggard will destroy him; For his hands refuse to labor. 
\v 26 The covetous man coveteth all the day long; But the righteous man giveth, and doth not withhold. 
\v 27 The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination; How much more when he bringeth it with an evil design! 
\v 28 A false witness shall perish; But a man that hearkeneth shall speak forever. 
\v 29 The wicked man hardeneth his face; But the upright directeth his way. 
\v 30 Wisdom is nothing, and understanding is nothing, And devices are nothing, against the LORD. 
\v 31 The horse is prepared for the day of battle; But victory is from the LORD. 
\c 22  
\p
\v 1 A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches; And better is good-will than silver and gold. 
\v 2 The rich and the poor meet together; The LORD is the Maker of them all. 
\v 3 The prudent man seeth the evil, and hideth himself; But the simple rush on, and are punished. 
\v 4 By humility and the fear of the LORD Are riches and honor and life. 
\v 5 Thorns and snares are in the way of the deceitful; He that will preserve his life will be far from them. 
\v 6 Train up a child in accordance with his way, And when he is old he will not depart from it. 
\v 7 The rich ruleth over the poor, And the borrower is servant to the lender. 
\v 8 He who soweth iniquity shall reap calamity, And the rod of his punishment is prepared. 
\v 9 He who hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed, Because he giveth of his bread to the poor. 
\v 10 Cast out the scoffer, and contention will go out; Yea, strife and reproach will cease. 
\v 11 He who loveth purity of heart, Grace is upon his lips, and the king will be his friend. 
\v 12 The eyes of the LORD watch over knowledge; But he overthroweth the words of the treacherous. 
\v 13 The slothful man saith, “There is a lion without; I shall be slain in the streets.” 
\v 14 The mouth of strange women is a deep pit; He with whom the LORD is angry shall fall therein. 
\v 15 Folly is bound to the heart of a child; But the rod of correction will drive it far from him. 
\v 16 He that oppresseth the poor to increase his wealth, And he that giveth to the rich, shall surely come to want. 
\v 17 Incline thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, And give heed to my instruction! 
\v 18 For it will be a pleasant thing, if thou keep them in thy bosom, When they are altogether established upon thy lips. 
\v 19 That thy trust may be in the LORD, I have this day given to thee instruction, yea, to thee. 
\v 20 Behold, I have written to thee excellent things Concerning counsel and knowledge; 
\v 21 That I may make thee know rectitude, and words of truth; That thou mayst bring back words of truth to them that send thee. 
\v 22 Rob not the poor man, because he is poor, Nor crush thou the destitute at the gate; 
\v 23 For the LORD will maintain their cause, And despoil their spoilers of life. 
\v 24 Make no friendship with a passionate man, Nor be the companion of a man prone to wrath; 
\v 25 Lest thou learn his ways, And take to thyself a snare. 
\v 26 Be not thou one of those who strike hands, Of those who are sureties for debts. 
\v 27 When thou hast nothing to pay, Why should thy bed be taken from under thee? 
\v 28 Remove not the ancient landmark, Which thy fathers have made. 
\v 29 Seest thou a man diligent in his business? He shall be the minister of kings; He shall not serve obscure men. 
\c 23  
\p
\v 1 When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, Consider well what is before thee; 
\v 2 For thou wilt put a knife to thy throat, If thou art a man given to appetite! 
\v 3 Long not for his dainties. For they are deceitful meat. 
\v 4 Toil not to become rich; Cease from this, thy wisdom. 
\v 5 Wilt thou let thine eyes fly toward them? They are gone! For riches truly make to themselves wings; They fly away like the eagle toward heaven. 
\v 6 Eat not the bread of him that hath an evil eye, And long not for his dainties; 
\v 7 For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he. “Eat and drink!” saith he to thee; But his heart is not with thee. 
\v 8 The morsel, which thou hast eaten, thou shalt vomit up; And thou wilt have thrown away thy sweet words. 
\v 9 Speak not in the ears of a fool; For he will despise the wisdom of thy words. 
\v 10 Remove not the ancient landmark, And enter not into the fields of the fatherless! 
\v 11 For their avenger is mighty; He will maintain their cause against thee. 
\v 12 Apply thy heart to instruction, And thine ears to the words of knowledge. 
\v 13 Withhold not correction from a child; If thou beat him with the rod, he will not die. 
\v 14 Beat him thyself with the rod, And thou shalt rescue him from the underworld. 
\v 15 My son, if thy heart be wise, My heart shall rejoice, even mine; 
\v 16 Yea, my reins shall exult, When thy lips speak right things. 
\v 17 Let not thy heart envy sinners, But continue thou in the fear of the LORD all the day long; 
\v 18 For surely there shall be a reward, And thine expectation shall not be cut off. 
\v 19 Hear thou, my son, and be wise; And let thy heart go forward in the way! 
\v 20 Be not thou among winebibbers, And riotous eaters of flesh; 
\v 21 For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty, And drowsiness will clothe a man with rags. 
\v 22 Hearken to thy father, who begat thee, And despise not thy mother when she is old. 
\v 23 Buy the truth, and sell it not; Buy wisdom and instruction and understanding. 
\v 24 The father of a righteous man shall greatly rejoice; Yea, he who begetteth a wise child shall have joy in him. 
\v 25 Let thy father and thy mother have joy; Yea, let her that bore thee rejoice! 
\v 26 My son, give me thy heart, And let thine eyes observe my ways! 
\v 27 For a harlot is a deep ditch; Yea, a strange woman is a narrow pit. 
\v 28 Like a robber she lieth in wait, And increaseth the treacherous among men. 
\v 29 Who hath woe? Who hath sorrow? Who contentions? Who anxiety? Who wounds without cause? Who dimness of eyes? 
\v 30 They that tarry long at the wine; They that go in to seek mixed wine. 
\v 31 Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, When it sparkleth in the cup, When it goeth down smoothly. 
\v 32 At the last it biteth like a serpent, And stingeth like an adder. 
\v 33 Thine eyes will look upon strange women, And thy heart will utter perverse things. 
\v 34 Yea, thou shalt be as one that lieth down in the midst of the sea, And as one that lieth down upon the top of a mast. 
\v 35 They have stricken me [[shalt thou say]],—I suffered no pain! They have beaten me,—I felt it not! When shall I awake? I will seek it yet again. 
\c 24  
\p
\v 1 Be not thou envious of wicked men, And desire not to be with them! 
\v 2 For their heart studieth destruction, And their lips speak mischief. 
\v 3 Through wisdom is a house builded, And by understanding is it established; 
\v 4 Yea, by knowledge are the chambers filled With all precious and goodly substance. 
\v 5 The wise man is strong; Yea, the man of understanding establisheth his strength. 
\v 6 For by wise counsel shalt thou make war, And by the multitude of counsellors cometh success. 
\v 7 Wisdom is too high for the fool; He openeth not his mouth at the gate. 
\v 8 He that deviseth to do evil Shall be called mischief-master. 
\v 9 The purpose of folly is sin; And a scoffer is an abomination to men. 
\v 10 If thy spirit faint in the day of adversity, Faint will be thy strength. 
\v 11 Deliver thou those who are dragged to death, And those who totter to the slaughter,—O keep them back! 
\v 12 If thou sayst, “Behold, we knew it not!” Doth not he that weigheth the heart observe it? Yea, he that keepeth thy soul knoweth it. And he will render to every man according to his works. 
\v 13 Eat honey, my son, for it is good, And the honeycomb, which is sweet to thy taste; 
\v 14 So learn thou wisdom for thy soul! When thou hast found it, there shall be a reward, And thy expectation shall not be cut off. 
\v 15 Plot not, O wicked man! against the habitation of the righteous; Spoil not his resting-place! 
\v 16 For though the righteous fall seven times, yet shall he rise up again; But the wicked shall fall into mischief. 
\v 17 Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, And let not thy heart be glad when he stumbleth; 
\v 18 Lest the LORD see, and it displease him, And he turn away his anger from him. 
\v 19 Fret not thyself on account of evil men, Neither be thou envious of the wicked; 
\v 20 For there shall be no posterity to the evil man; The lamp of the wicked shall be put out. 
\v 21 My son, fear thou the LORD and the king; And mingle not with them that are given to change! 
\v 22 For their calamity shall rise up suddenly, And their ruin, coming from them both, in a moment. 
\v 23 These also are words of the wise. It is not good to have respect of persons in judgment. 
\v 24 He that saith to the wicked, “Thou art righteous,” Him shall the people curse; Nations shall abhor him. 
\v 25 But it shall be well with them that punish him, And the blessing of prosperity shall come upon them. 
\v 26 He that giveth a right answer Kisseth the lips. 
\v 27 Arrange thy work without, And prepare it in thy field: Afterwards thou mayst build thy house. 
\v 28 Be not a witness without cause against thy neighbor, And deceive not with thy lips. 
\v 29 Say not, “As he hath done to me, So will I do to him; I will render to the man according to his doings.” 
\v 30 I passed by the field of the slothful, And by the vineyard of the man void of understanding, 
\v 31 And, lo! it was all overgrown with thorns, And the face thereof was covered with nettles, And the stone wall thereof was broken down. 
\v 32 Then I saw, and considered it well; I looked upon it. and received instruction. 
\v 33 “A little sleep, a little slumber! A little folding of the hands to rest!” 
\v 34 So shall poverty come upon thee like a highwayman; Yea, want like an armed man. 
\c 25  
\p
\v 1 These also are proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah, king of Judah, collected. 
\v 2 It is the glory of God to conceal a thing; But it is the glory of kings to search out a matter. 
\v 3 As the heavens for their height, And as the earth for its depth, So is the heart of kings unsearchable! 
\v 4 Take away the dross from the silver, And there will come forth a vessel for the founder; 
\v 5 Take away the wicked man from the presence of the king, And his throne will be established by righteousness. 
\v 6 Put not thyself forth in the presence of the king, Nor set thyself in the place of the great; 
\v 7 For better is it that one should say to thee, “Come up hither!” Than that he should put thee in a lower place, In the presence of the prince whom thine eyes behold. 
\v 8 Go not forth hastily to engage in a suit, Lest thou know not what to do in the end of it, When thine adversary hath put thee to shame. 
\v 9 Maintain thy cause with thine adversary, But reveal not another's secret; 
\v 10 Lest he that heareth it put thee to shame, And thy infamy depart not from thee. 
\v 11 A word spoken in season Is like apples of gold in figured-work of silver. 
\v 12 As a ring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, So is a wise reprover to an attentive ear. 
\v 13 As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, So is a faithful messenger to them that send him; For he refresheth the spirit of his masters. 
\v 14 As clouds and wind without rain, So is the man that boasteth falsely of giving. 
\v 15 By long forbearing is a prince appeased; And a soft tongue breaketh bones. 
\v 16 Hast thou found honey? eat what is sufficient for thee, Lest thou be surfeited with it, and vomit it up. 
\v 17 Let thy foot be seldom in the house of thy friend, Lest he be surfeited with thee and hate thee. 
\v 18 A battle-hammer, and a sword, and a sharp arrow, Is the man who beareth false witness against his neighbor. 
\v 19 As a broken tooth, and a wavering foot, So is trust in an unfaithful man in time of trouble. 
\v 20 As he that taketh off a garment on a cold day, As vinegar upon nitre, So is he that singeth songs to a heavy heart. 
\v 21 If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; And if he be thirsty, give him water to drink; 
\v 22 For thou wilt heap coals of fire upon his head, And the LORD will reward thee. 
\v 23 As the north wind bringeth forth rain, So a backbiting tongue maketh an angry countenance. 
\v 24 Better is it to dwell in a corner of the housetop, Than with a quarrelsome woman in a large house. 
\v 25 As cold water to the thirsty, So is good news from a far country. 
\v 26 As a troubled fountain, and as a corrupted spring, So is a righteous man falling before the wicked. 
\v 27 To eat much honey is not good; So the search of high things is weariness. 
\v 28 As a city broken through and without a wall, So is he that hath no rule over his spirit. 
\c 26  
\p
\v 1 As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, So honor is not becoming to a fool. 
\v 2 As the sparrow wandereth, and the swallow flieth away, So the curse without cause shall not come. 
\v 3 A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, And a rod for the back of the fool. 
\v 4 Answer not a fool according to his folly, Lest thou also become like to him. 
\v 5 Answer a fool according to his folly, Lest he be wise in his own conceit. 
\v 6 He cutteth off the feet, and drinketh damage, Who sendeth a message by the hand of a fool. 
\v 7 The legs of a lame man hang loose; So is it with a proverb in the mouth of fools. 
\v 8 As he who bindeth a stone in a sling, So is he that giveth honor to a fool. 
\v 9 As a thorn lifted up by the hand of a drunkard, So is a proverb in the mouth of fools. 
\v 10 As an archer who woundeth every one, So is he who hireth fools and hireth wayfarers. 
\v 11 As a dog returneth to that which he hath vomited, So a fool repeateth his folly. 
\v 12 Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? There is more hope of a fool than of him. 
\v 13 The slothful man saith, “There is a lion in the way; There is a lion in the streets.” 
\v 14 As a door turneth upon its hinges, So doth the sluggard upon his bed. 
\v 15 The sluggard dippeth his hand into the dish; It grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth. 
\v 16 The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit Than seven men who can render a reason. 
\v 17 As one that taketh a dog by the ears, So is he who, passing by, is enraged on account of the quarrel of another. 
\v 18 As a madman That casteth about darts, arrows, and death, 
\v 19 So is the man who deceiveth his neighbor, And saith, “Was I not in sport?” 
\v 20 Where there is no wood, the fire goeth out; So, where there is no talebearer, contention ceaseth. 
\v 21 As coal is for heat, and as wood for fire, So is a contentious man for kindling strife. 
\v 22 The words of a talebearer are like dainties; For they go down to the innermost parts of the body. 
\v 23 As drossy silver spread over an earthen vessel, So are warm lips and an evil heart. 
\v 24 The hater dissembleth with his lips, And layeth up deceit within him. 
\v 25 When he speaketh fair, believe him not! For there are seven abominations in his heart. 
\v 26 His hatred is covered by deceit; His wickedness shall be revealed in the great assembly. 
\v 27 He that diggeth a pit shall fall therein; And he that rolleth a stone, it shall return upon him. 
\v 28 A lying tongue hateth those whom it woundeth, And a flattering mouth worketh ruin. 
\c 27  
\p
\v 1 Boast not thyself of to-morrow; For thou knowest not what a day may bring forth! 
\v 2 Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; A stranger, and not thine own lips. 
\v 3 A stone is heavy and sand is weighty; But a fool's wrath is heavier than both. 
\v 4 Wrath is cruel, and anger overwhelming; But who is able to stand before jealousy? 
\v 5 Better is open rebuke Than love kept concealed. 
\v 6 Faithful are the wounds of a friend; But the kisses of an enemy are deceitful. 
\v 7 He who is fed to the full loatheth the honeycomb; But to the hungry any bitter thing is sweet. 
\v 8 As a bird that wandereth from its nest, So is a man who wandereth from his place. 
\v 9 Oil and perfume gladden the heart; Sweet also is one's friend by hearty counsel. 
\v 10 Thine own friend and thy father's friend forsake not; And go not into thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity. Better is a neighbor that is near, than a brother far off. 
\v 11 Be wise, my son, and make my heart glad, That I may give an answer to him that reproacheth me. 
\v 12 A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself; The simple pass on, and are punished. 
\v 13 Take his garment who is surety for another; Yea, take a pledge of him who is bound for a stranger. 
\v 14 He who blesseth his neighbor with a loud voice, rising early for it, It shall be accounted to him as a curse. 
\v 15 A continual dropping in a very rainy day And a quarrelsome wife are alike. 
\v 16 He who restraineth her restraineth the wind; And his right hand layeth hold of oil. 
\v 17 Iron sharpeneth iron; So one man sharpeneth the face of another. 
\v 18 He that watcheth the fig-tree shall eat its fruit; So he that is careful for his master shall come to honor. 
\v 19 As in water face answereth to face, So doth the heart of man to man. 
\v 20 The realms of the dead are never full; So the eyes of man are never satisfied. 
\v 21 The refining-pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold; So let a man be to the mouth that giveth him praise. 
\v 22 Though thou shouldst beat a fool in a mortar, Among bruised wheat, with a pestle, Yet will not his folly depart from him. 
\v 23 Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, And look well to thy herds! 
\v 24 For riches last not for ever; Not even a crown endureth from generation to generation. 
\v 25 The hay disappeareth, and the tender grass showeth itself, And the herbage of the mountains is gathered in. 
\v 26 The lambs are thy clothing, And the goats the price of thy field. 
\v 27 There is goat's milk enough for thy food, For the food of thy household, And for the sustenance of thy maidens. 
\c 28  
\p
\v 1 The wicked flee when no one pursueth; But the righteous is as bold as a lion. 
\v 2 Through the transgression of a land many are its rulers; But through men of prudence and understanding the prince shall live long. 
\v 3 A poor man who oppresseth the needy Is a sweeping rain which leaveth no food. 
\v 4 They who forsake the law praise the wicked; But they who keep the law contend with them. 
\v 5 Wicked men understand not equity; But they who seek the LORD understand all things. 
\v 6 Better is a poor man who walketh in uprightness, Than he who is perverse in his ways, though he be rich. 
\v 7 He that keepeth the law is a wise son; But he that is the companion of prodigals bringeth shame on his father. 
\v 8 He that increaseth his substance by usurious gain Gathereth it for him who will pity the poor. 
\v 9 He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, Even his prayer shall be an abomination. 
\v 10 He that causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way Shall himself fall into his own pit; But the upright shall have good things in possession. 
\v 11 The rich man is wise in his own conceit; But the poor man, who hath understanding, will search him through. 
\v 12 When the righteous rejoice, there is great glorying; But, when the wicked are exalted, men hide themselves. 
\v 13 He that covereth his sins shall not prosper; But he that confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy. 
\v 14 Happy the man who feareth always! But he who hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief. 
\v 15 As a roaring lion and a hungry bear, So is a wicked ruler over a needy people. 
\v 16 The prince who is weak in understanding is great in oppression; But he who hateth unjust gain shall prolong his days. 
\v 17 A man who is burdened with life-blood—Let him flee to the pit! let no man stay him! 
\v 18 He who walketh uprightly shall be safe; But he who is perverse in his ways shall fall at once. 
\v 19 He who tilleth his land shall have bread enough; And he that followeth after worthless persons shall have poverty enough. 
\v 20 A faithful man shall abound with blessings; But he that maketh haste to be rich shall not go unpunished. 
\v 21 To have respect to persons is not good; Since for a piece of bread that man will transgress. 
\v 22 He who hath an evil eye hasteth after wealth, And considereth not that poverty will come upon him. 
\v 23 He who rebuketh a man shall afterwards find favor More than he who flattereth with his tongue. 
\v 24 Whoso stealeth from his father or his mother, And saith, “It is no transgression,” The same is the companion of a robber. 
\v 25 He who is of a proud heart stirreth up strife; But he that trusteth in the LORD shall be rich. 
\v 26 He who trusteth in his own understanding is a fool; But he who walketh wisely shall be delivered. 
\v 27 He who giveth to the poor shall not want; But he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse. 
\v 28 When the wicked are exalted, men hide themselves; But, when they perish, the righteous increase. 
\c 29  
\p
\v 1 He who, being often reproved, hardeneth his neck, Shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy. 
\v 2 When the righteous are powerful, the people rejoice; But when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn. 
\v 3 He who loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father; But he who is a companion of harlots destroyeth his substance. 
\v 4 A king by equity establisheth a land; But he who receiveth gifts overthroweth it. 
\v 5 A man who flattereth his neighbor Spreadeth a net for his feet. 
\v 6 In the transgression of a wicked man there is a snare; But the righteous shall sing and rejoice. 
\v 7 A righteous man careth for the cause of the poor; A wicked man discerneth not knowledge. 
\v 8 Scoffers kindle a city into a flame; But wise men pacify wrath. 
\v 9 If a wise man contend in a cause with a fool, Whether he rage or laugh, there will be no rest. 
\v 10 The bloodthirsty man hateth the upright; But the righteous seek to preserve his life. 
\v 11 A fool letteth all his anger come out; But a wise man keepeth it back. 
\v 12 If a ruler listen to words of falsehood, All his servants become wicked. 
\v 13 The poor man and the oppressor meet together: The LORD giveth light to the eyes of them both. 
\v 14 The king that judgeth the poor with uprightness, His throne shall be established for ever. 
\v 15 The rod and reproof give wisdom; But a child left to himself bringeth shame to his mother. 
\v 16 When the wicked are powerful, transgression increaseth; But the righteous shall see their fall. 
\v 17 Chastise thy son, and he will give thee rest; Yea, he will give delight to thy soul. 
\v 18 Where there is no vision, the people become unruly; But he that keepeth the law, happy is he. 
\v 19 A servant will not be corrected by words; For, though he understand, he will not obey. 
\v 20 Seest thou a man hasty in his words? There is more hope of a fool than of him. 
\v 21 He that bringeth up his servant delicately from childhood Shall have him become a son at the last. 
\v 22 An angry man stirreth up strife, And a passionate man aboundeth in transgression. 
\v 23 A man's pride will bring him low; But he that is of a humble spirit shall obtain honor. 
\v 24 He who shareth with a thief hateth himself: He heareth the curse, but maketh no discovery. 
\v 25 The fear of man bringeth a snare; But whoso putteth his trust in the LORD shall be safe. 
\v 26 Many are they who seek the ruler's favor; But every man's judgment cometh from the LORD. 
\v 27 As the unjust man is an abomination to the righteous, So the upright in his way is an abomination to the wicked.

\v 1 The words of Agur, the son of Jakeh, even his prophecy; the inspired utterance of the man to Ithiel, even to Ithiel and Ucal. 
\v 2 Truly I am more stupid than any man; There is not in me the understanding of a man. 
\v 3 I have not learned wisdom, Nor have I gained the knowledge of the Most Holy. 
\v 4 Who hath gone up into heaven and come down? Who hath gathered the wind in his fists? Who hath bound up the waters in a garment? Who hath established all the ends of the earth? What is his name, and what his son's name, if thou knowest? 
\v 5 Every word of God is pure; A shield is he to them that put their trust in him. 
\v 6 Add not to his words, Lest he rebuke thee, and thou be found a liar. 
\v 7 Two things do I ask of thee; Withhold them not from me, before I die! 
\v 8 Remove far from me falsehood and lies; Give me neither poverty nor riches; Feed me with the food which is needful for me; 
\v 9 Lest I be full, and deny thee, And say, “Who is the LORD?” Or lest I be poor, and steal, And violate the name of my God. 
\v 10 Talk not against a servant to his master, Lest he curse thee, and thou suffer for it. 
\v 11 There is a class of men that curse their fathers, And do not bless their mothers. 
\v 12 There is a class who are pure in their own eyes, And yet are not washed from their filthiness. 
\v 13 There is a class,—O how lofty are their eyes, And how are their eyelids lifted up! 
\v 14 There is a class, whose teeth are swords, And their jaw-teeth knives, To devour the poor from off the earth, And the needy from among men. 
\v 15 The vampire hath two daughters; “Give! give!” [[is their cry.]] There are three things which are never satisfied; Yea, four which say not, “Enough!” 
\v 16 The underworld, and the barren womb; The earth, which is not satiated with water, And fire, which never saith, “It is enough!” 
\v 17 The eye that mocketh at a father, And scorneth to obey a mother, The ravens of the valley shall pick it out, And the young eagles shall eat it. 
\v 18 These three things are too wonderful for me; Yea, there are four which I understand not: 
\v 19 The track of an eagle in the air, The track of a serpent upon a rock, The track of a ship in the midst of the sea, And the track of a man with a maid. 
\v 20 Such is the way of an adulterous woman; She eateth, and wipeth her mouth, And saith, “I have done nothing wrong.” 
\v 21 Under three things is the earth disquieted; Yea, under four it cannot bear up: 
\v 22 Under a servant when he becometh a king, And a fool when he is filled with bread; 
\v 23 Under an odious woman when she becometh a wife, And a handmaid when she becometh heir to her mistress. 
\v 24 There are four things which are small upon the earth, Yet are they wise, instructed in wisdom. 
\v 25 The ants are a people not strong, Yet they prepare in the summer their food. 
\v 26 The conies are a feeble people, Yet do they make their houses in the rocks. 
\v 27 The locusts have no king, Yet do they all go forth in bands. 
\v 28 The lizard seizeth with its hands, And is in king's palaces. 
\v 29 These three have a graceful step; Yea, four are graceful in their walk: 
\v 30 The lion, the hero among beasts, Which turneth not back for any; 
\v 31 The loin-girded war-horse, the he-goat, And a king who cannot be withstood. 
\v 32 If thou hast been foolish in lifting thyself up, And hast meditated evil, Put thy hand on thy mouth! 
\v 33 For, as the pressing of milk bringeth forth cheese, And as the pressing of the nose bringeth forth blood, So the pressing of anger bringeth forth strife.

\v 1 The words given to King Lemuel; the prophecy which his mother taught him. 
\v 2 What, O my son! and what, O son of my womb! Yea, what, O son of my vows! [[shall I say to thee?]] 
\v 3 Give not thy strength to women, Nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings! 
\v 4 It is not for kings, O Lemuel! It is not for kings to drink wine, Nor for princes to desire strong drink; 
\v 5 Lest they drink, and forget the law, And pervert the rights of any of the afflicted. 
\v 6 Give strong drink to him who is ready to perish, And wine to him that hath a heavy heart; 
\v 7 Let him drink and forget his poverty, And remember his misery no more! 
\v 8 Open thy mouth for the dumb, In the cause of every orphan! 
\v 9 Open thy mouth, judge righteously, And maintain the cause of the poor and needy! 
\v 10 Who can find a capable woman? Her worth is far above pearls. 
\v 11 The heart of her husband trusteth in her, And he is in no want of gain. 
\v 12 She doeth him good, and not evil, All the days of her life. 
\v 13 She seeketh wool and flax, And worketh willingly with her hands. 
\v 14 She is like the merchants' ships; She bringeth her food from afar. 
\v 15 She riseth while it is yet night, And giveth food to her family, And a task to her maidens. 
\v 16 She layeth a plan for a field, and buyeth it; With the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard. 
\v 17 She girdeth her loins with strength, And maketh strong her arms. 
\v 18 She perceiveth how pleasant is her gain, And her lamp is not extinguished in the night. 
\v 19 She putteth forth her hands to the distaff, And her hands take hold of the spindle. 
\v 20 She spreadeth out her hand to the poor, Yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy. 
\v 21 She hath no fear for her household on account of the snow, For all her household are clothed with crimson. 
\v 22 She maketh for herself coverlets; Her clothing is of fine linen and purple. 
\v 23 Her husband is known in the gates, When he sitteth with the elders of the land. 
\v 24 She maketh linen garments and selleth them, And delivereth girdles to the merchant. 
\v 25 Strength and honor are her clothing; And she laugheth at the days to come. 
\v 26 She openeth her mouth with wisdom, And kind instruction is upon her tongue. 
\v 27 She looketh well to the ways of her household, And eateth not the bread of idleness. 
\v 28 Her children rise up, and extol her; Her husband, and praiseth her, [[saving,]] 
\v 29 “Many daughters have done, virtuously, But thou excellest them all.” 
\v 30 Grace is deceitful, and beauty vain; But the woman that feareth the LORD, she shall be praised. 
\v 31 Give ye her of the fruit of her hands, And let her works praise her in the gates.
