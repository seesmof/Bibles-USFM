\v 1 In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of Jehovah to Zechariah, the son of Barachiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying:— 
\v 2 Jehovah hath been much displeased with your fathers. 
\v 3 But say thou to them, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Turn ye to me, saith Jehovah of hosts, And I will turn to you, saith Jehovah of hosts. 
\v 4 Be ye not as your fathers, to whom the former prophets cried, saying, Turn ye now from your evil ways, and from your evil doings! But they did not hear, nor hearken to me, saith Jehovah. 
\v 5 Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever? 
\v 6 But my words and my statutes, Which I commanded my servants, the prophets, Did they not overtake your fathers? And they returned and said, Even as Jehovah of hosts thought To do to us according to our ways, and according to doings, So hath he done to us. 
\v 7 On the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of Jehovah to Zechariah, the son of Barachiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying: 
\v 8 I saw in the night, and behold, a man riding upon a red horse; and he stood among the myrtle-trees that were in the deep valley, and behind him were other horses, red, fox-colored, and white. 
\v 9 Then I said, What are these, my lord? And the angel that talked with me said to me, I will show thee what these are. 
\v 10 And the man that stood among the myrtle-trees answered and said, These are they whom Jehovah hath sent to go to and fro through the earth. 
\v 11 And they answered the angel of Jehovah that stood among the myrtle-trees, and said, We have gone to and fro through the earth, and behold, all the earth is still and at rest. 
\v 12 Then the angel of Jehovah answered, and said, O Jehovah of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years? 
\v 13 And Jehovah answered the angel that talked with me good words and comfortable words. 
\v 14 And the angel who talked with me said to me: Proclaim thou and say, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with great jealousy, 
\v 15 And with great anger am I angry with the nations that are at ease; For I was but a little displeased, And they helped forward the affliction. 
\v 16 Therefore thus saith Jehovah: I return to Jerusalem with mercies; My house shall be built in it, Saith Jehovah of hosts, And a measuring-line shall be stretched forth over Jerusalem. 
\v 17 Proclaim yet and say, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: My cities shall yet overflow with prosperity, And Jehovah will yet comfort Zion, And will yet choose Jerusalem. 
\v 18 Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, four horns. 
\v 19 And I said to the angel that talked with me, What mean these? And he answered me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem. 
\v 20 And Jehovah showed me four smiths. 
\v 21 Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying, These are the horns which scattered Judah, so that no man lifted up his head; and now these are come to terrify them, to cast out the horns of the nations which lifted up their horn against the land of Judah to scatter it. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold, a man with a measuring-line in his hand. 
\v 2 Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said to me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof. 
\v 3 And behold, the angel who talked with me went forth, and another angel went forth to meet him, 
\v 4 and said to him, Run, speak to that young man, saying: Jerusalem shall be inhabited without walls On account of the multitude of men and of cattle within her. 
\v 5 And I will be to her, saith Jehovah, A wall of fire round about, And glory will I be within her. 
\v 6 Ho! ho! flee ye out of the land of the North, saith Jehovah; For toward the four winds of heaven have I scattered you abroad, saith Jehovah. 
\v 7 Ho, Zion, escape, Thou that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon! 
\v 8 For thus saith Jehovah of hosts: For glory hath he sent me to the nations which plundered you; (For he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye.) 
\v 9 For, behold, I will shake my hand over them, And they shall be a spoil to those that served them; And ye shall know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me. 
\v 10 Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion! For, behold, I will come, And I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith Jehovah; 
\v 11 And many nations shall join themselves to Jehovah in that day, And shall be my people; And I will dwell in the midst of thee; And thou shalt know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me to thee. 
\v 12 And Jehovah will possess Judah as his portion in the holy land, And will again choose Jerusalem. 
\v 13 Be silent, all flesh, before Jehovah! For he riseth up from his holy habitation. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 And he showed me Joshua, the high-priest, standing before the angel of Jehovah, and the adversary standing at his right hand, to accuse him. 
\v 2 And Jehovah said to the adversary:— Jehovah rebuke thee, thou adversary, Even Jehovah, who hath chosen Jerusalem, rebuke thee! Is not this man a brand plucked out of the fire? 
\v 3 Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel. 
\v 4 And he [[the angel]] spake and said to them [[the angels]] that stood before him, saying, Take off the filthy garments from him. And to him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and will clothe thee with goodly apparel. 
\v 5 And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head! And they set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel of Jehovah stood by. 
\v 6 And the angel of Jehovah declared to Joshua and said: 
\v 7 Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: If thou wilt walk in my ways, And if thou wilt keep my charge, Then thou shalt also rule my house, And shalt also keep my courts, And I will give thee guides among these that stand by. 
\v 8 Hear now, O Joshua, high-priest, Thou and thy companions, who sit before thee! For they are men that are signs. For, behold, I will cause to come my servant, the Branch. 
\v 9 For, behold, the stone which I have laid before Joshua, Upon this one stone shall be seven eyes; Behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith Jehovah of hosts; And I will remove the iniquity of this land in one day. 
\v 10 In that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, Shall ye invite every one his neighbor Under the vine and under the fig-tree. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 And the angel that talked with me came again, and awaked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep, 
\v 2 and said to me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold, a chandelier all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and its seven lamps upon it, and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top of it; 
\v 3 and two olive-trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side of it. 
\v 4 And I spake, and said to the angel that talked with me, What mean these, my lord? 
\v 5 Then the angel who talked with me answered and said to me, Knowest thou not what these mean? And I said, No, my lord. 
\v 6 Then he answered and spake to me, saying, This is the word of Jehovah to Zerubbabel, saying:— Not by might, nor by power, But by my spirit, Saith Jehovah of hosts. 
\v 7 What art thou, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain! And he shall bring forth the corner-stone amid shoutings, [[The people crying,]] “Grace, grace be to it!” 
\v 8 Moreover, the word of Jehovah came to me, saying: 
\v 9 The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands shall finish it. And thou shalt know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me to you. 
\v 10 For who hath despised the day of small things? With joy shall the plummet be seen in the hand of Zerubbabel by those seven; they are the eyes of Jehovah, which run to and fro through the whole earth. 
\v 11 Then I spake and said to him, What mean these two olive-trees, upon the right side of the chandelier and upon the left side thereof? 
\v 12 And I spake the second time, and said to him, What mean these two olive-branches, which are by the side of the two golden tubes which empty the golden oil out of themselves? 
\v 13 And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these mean? And I said, No, my lord. 
\v 14 And he said, These are the two anointed ones that stand before the Lord of all the earth. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 And I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, a flying roll. 
\v 2 And he said to me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a flying roll; the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits. 
\v 3 Then said he to me:— This is the curse that goeth forth Over the Face of the whole land; For every one who stealeth shall be cut off from hence, according to it, And every one who sweareth falsely shall be cut off from hence, according to it. 
\v 4 I will bring it forth, saith Jehovah of hosts, And it shall enter into the house of the thief, And into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name; And it shall abide in his house, And shall consume it, with the timber thereof and the stones thereof. 
\v 5 Then the angel who talked with me went forth, and said to me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what this is which goeth forth. 
\v 6 And I said, What is it? And he said, This is an ephah which goeth forth. He said, moreover, This is their image through all the land. 
\v 7 And behold, a talent of lead was lifted up, and a woman was sitting upon the ephah. 
\v 8 And he said, This is the Wickedness. And he cast her into the ephah, and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof. 
\v 9 Then lifted I up mine eyes and looked, and behold, there came forth two women, and wind was in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and heaven. 
\v 10 Then said I to the angel who talked with me, Whither do these bear the ephah? 
\v 11 And he said to me, To build it a house in the land of Shinar, that it may be fixed there, and set upon its base. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1 And I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass. 
\v 2 In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot, black horses; 
\v 3 and in the third chariot, white horses; and in the fourth chariot, spotted-red horses. 
\v 4 Then I spake, and said to the angel that talked with me, What are these, my lord? 
\v 5 And the angel answered and said to me, These are the four Winds of heaven, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth. 
\v 6 The black horses, which are thereto, go forth into the north country, and the white go forth after them; and the spotted go forth into the south country. 
\v 7 And the red ones went forth, and sought to go, even to walk to and fro through the earth. And he said, Go, walk ye to and fro through the earth! So they walked to and fro through the earth. 
\v 8 Then he cried to me, and spake to me, saying, Behold, these that go forth toward the land of the North shall execute my wrath against the land of the North. 
\v 9 And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying: 
\v 10 Take from those of the captivity, from Heldai, from Tobijah, and from Jedaiah, and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah, the son of Zephaniah, whither they are come from Babylon; 
\v 11 take from them silver and gold, and make a crown, and set it upon the head of Joshua, the son of Josedech, the high-priest, 
\v 12 and speak to him, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts:— Behold a man whose name is the Branch, He shall spring up from his place, And he shall build the temple of Jehovah. 
\v 13 He shall build the temple of Jehovah, And he shall bear the majesty, And sit and rule upon his throne, And be a priest upon his throne, And the counsel of peace shall be between them both. 
\v 14 And the crown shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen, the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of Jehovah. 
\v 15 And they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of Jehovah; and ye shall know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me to you. And this shall come to pass, if ye will diligently obey the voice of Jehovah, your God. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass, in the fourth year of King Darius, that the word of Jehovah came to Zechariah, on the fourth day of the ninth month, even in Chisleu; 
\v 2 when they had sent to the house of God Sherezer and Regem-melech, and their men, to pray before Jehovah, 
\v 3 and to speak to the priests that were in the house of Jehovah of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, “Shall I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years?” 
\v 4 Then came the word of Jehovah of hosts to me, saying, 
\v 5 Speak to all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth month and in the seventh month, even those seventy years, did ye at all fast for me, even for me? 
\v 6 And when ye eat and drink, is it not ye that eat, and ye that drink? 
\v 7 Are not these the words which Jehovah proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and her cities round about her, and when the South and the Plain were inhabited? 
\v 8 And the word of Jehovah came to Zechariah, saying, 
\v 9 Thus spake Jehovah of hosts, saying, Judge true judgment, and show mercy and compassion every man to his brother. 
\v 10 And the widow, and the orphan, and the stranger, and the poor, oppress not, and meditate not evil against one another in your heart. 
\v 11 But they refused to hearken, and showed a refractory shoulder, and made their ears dull, that they might not hear; 
\v 12 yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, that they might not hear the law, and the words which Jehovah of hosts sent through his spirit by the former prophets. Therefore came great anger from Jehovah of hosts. 
\v 13 And as he called and they would not hear, so they called and I would not hear, saith Jehovah of hosts. 
\v 14 And I scattered them as with a whirlwind among all the nations, which they knew not. And the land was desolate after them, so that no man passed through, nor returned; and thus the beautiful land was made a desolation. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1 And the word of Jehovah of hosts came to me, saying, 
\v 2 Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: I have been jealous for Zion with great jealousy, And with great wrath have I been jealous for her. 
\v 3 Thus saith Jehovah: I have returned to Zion, And I will dwell in Jerusalem; And Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth, And the mountain of Jehovah of hosts the holy mountain. 
\v 4 Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: There shall yet old men and old women dwell In the streets of Jerusalem, Every one with his staff in his hand for great age. 
\v 5 And the streets of the city shall be full Of boys and girls playing in her streets. 
\v 6 Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: If it be difficult in the eyes Of the residue of this people in these days, Is it therefore difficult in my eyes, Saith Jehovah of hosts? 
\v 7 Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Behold, I will save my people From the land of the rising, and from the land of the setting sun. 
\v 8 And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in Jerusalem; And they shall be my people, And I will be their God, In truth and in righteousness. 
\v 9 Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Let your hands be strong, Ye that hear in these days These words by the mouth of the prophets, Who were in the day when the foundation of the house of Jehovah of hosts was laid, The temple, that it might be built. 
\v 10 For before these days There was no recompense for men, Nor was there any recompense for beasts; Nor to him that went out, nor to him that came in, was there security from the enemy; For I set all men one against another. 
\v 11 But now I will not be as in former days Toward the residue of this people, Saith Jehovah of hosts. 
\v 12 For the seed shall be prosperous; The vine shall yield its fruit, And the earth shall yield her increase, And the heavens shall yield their dew; And I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these. 
\v 13 And it shall be, that as ye were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, So will I save you, and ye shall be a blessing. Fear not; let your hands be strong! 
\v 14 For thus saith Jehovah of hosts: As I thought to do you evil, When your fathers provoked me to anger, Saith Jehovah of hosts, And I repented not, 
\v 15 So have I again thought in these days To do good to Jerusalem, And to the house of Judah. Fear ye not! 
\v 16 These are the things which ye shall do: Speak ye every man the truth to his neighbor; Judge according to truth, and for peace in your gates; 
\v 17 And meditate not evil against one another in your hearts, And love not a false oath! For all these are things which I hate, saith Jehovah. 
\v 18 And the word of Jehovah of hosts came to me, saying, 
\v 19 Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of the fifth month, And the fast of the seventh month, and the fast of the tenth month, Shall be to the house of Judah for joy and gladness, And cheerful festivals. But love ye truth and peace! 
\v 20 Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: It shall yet come to pass, that many nations shall come, And the inhabitants of many cities; 
\v 21 And the inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying, “Let us go speedily to pray before Jehovah, And to seek Jehovah of hosts! I will go also!” 
\v 22 Then shall come many nations and mighty kingdoms, To seek Jehovah of hosts in Jerusalem, And to pray before Jehovah. 
\v 23 Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: In those days shall ten men of all languages of the nations take hold, They shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, Saying, “We will go with you, For we have heard that God is with you.” 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 The prophecy of the word of Jehovah is against the land of Hadrach, And upon Damascus shall it come down, For the eye of Jehovah is over man, And over all the tribes of Israel, 
\v 2 And against Hamath, which bordereth thereon, And Tyre and Sidon, though she be very wise. 
\v 3 Though Tyre hath built her a fortress, And hath heaped up silver as dust, And fine gold as the mire of the streets, 
\v 4 Behold, the Lord will cast her out, And will smite her power into the sea, And she shall be devoured by fire. 
\v 5 Askelon shall see it and fear, Gaza also shall see and tremble, And Ekron, because her expectation shall be put to shame. The king shall perish from Gaza, And Askelon shall not be inhabited. 
\v 6 And strangers shall dwell in Ashdod, And I will cut off the pride of the Philistines. 
\v 7 And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, And his abominations from between his teeth; And even he shall be left for our God, And he shall be as a governor in Judah, And Ekron as a Jebusite. 
\v 8 And I will encamp about my house, as a garrison, Against him that passeth by and him that returneth, And no oppressor shall pass through them any more; For now have I seen with my own eyes. 
\v 9 Rejoice greatly, daughter of Zion, Shout, daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, thy king cometh to thee; He is just and victorious, Mild, and riding upon an ass, Even upon a colt, the foal of an ass. 
\v 10 And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, And the horse from Jerusalem; And the battle-bow shall be cut off. And he shall speak peace to the nations; And his dominion shall be from sea to sea, And from the river to the ends of the earth. 
\v 11 As for thee also, on account of thy blood-sealed covenant, I will set thy prisoners free from the pit wherein is no water. 
\v 12 Return ye to the strong-hold, ye prisoners of hope! Even this day do I declare it: I will restore double unto thee. 
\v 13 For I will bend Judah as a bow for myself; As a bow will I extend Ephraim to the utmost; And I will raise up thy sons, O Zion, Against thy sons, O Greece, And make thee as the sword of a mighty man. 
\v 14 And Jehovah shall be seen over them. And his arrow shall go forth as lightning; And the Lord Jehovah shall blow the trumpet, And shall go forth with whirlwinds of the South. 
\v 15 Jehovah of hosts shall defend them; And they shall devour, and trample under feet the sling-stones, And they shall drink, and shout as through wine, And they shall be filled like a bowl, like the corners of the altar. 
\v 16 And Jehovah, their God, shall save them in that day; He will save his people as a flock; For they shall be as the stones of a crown, lifting themselves up in his land. 
\v 17 How great shall be their prosperity, and how great their beauty! Corn shall make the young men thrive, and new wire the maidens. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1 Ask ye of Jehovah rain in the time of the latter rain! It is Jehovah that maketh the lightning; And he will give you abundant showers, To every one the herb of the field. 
\v 2 For the teraphim speak falsehood, And the diviners see a lie, And the dreams speak falsehood; Vain are their consolations. Therefore they wander as a flock; They are in distress, because there is no shepherd. 
\v 3 My anger is kindled against the shepherds, And the bucks will I punish; For Jehovah of hosts will visit his flock, the house of Judah, And make them as his goodly horse in battle. 
\v 4 From him shall come forth the corner-stone, From him the nail, From him the battle-bow; From him shall every leader come forth. 
\v 5 And they shall be as mighty men, Who tread down their enemies in battle as the mire of the streets, And they shall fight, because Jehovah is with them, So that the riders on horses shall be confounded. 
\v 6 And I will strengthen the house of Judah, And give victory to the house of Joseph, And I will set them in their dwellings, because I have compassion upon them; And they shall be as though I had not cast them off; For I am Jehovah, their God, and I will hear them. 
\v 7 And Ephraim shall be as a mighty man, And their heart shall rejoice, as through wine; And their sons shall see it and rejoice, Their hearts shall rejoice in Jehovah. 
\v 8 I will whistle for them, and will gather them; for I have redeemed them; And they shall increase as they increased before. 
\v 9 Though I scatter them among the nations, Yet in far countries will they remember me; And they shall live with their children, and shall return. 
\v 10 And I will bring them back from the land of Egypt, And from Assyria will I gather them; And I will bring them into the land of Gilead and of Lebanon, And there shall not be room enough for them. 
\v 11 And he shall pass through the sea of distress, And he shall smite the sea of waves, And all the depths of the river shall be dried up; And the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, And the sceptre of Egypt shall depart. 
\v 12 And I will strengthen them through Jehovah, And in his name shall they walk, saith Jehovah. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 Open thy doors, O Lebanon, That the fire may devour thy cedars! 
\v 2 Howl, O cypress, for the cedar falleth! For the lofty ones are destroyed! Howl, O ye oaks of Bashan, For the high forest is come down! 
\v 3 Hark! the voice of the howling of the shepherds, Because their glory is destroyed! The voice of the roaring of young lions, Because the pride of Jordan is destroyed! 
\v 4 Thus said Jehovah, my God: Feed thou the flock of slaughter, 
\v 5 Whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty, And which they who sell say, “Blessed be Jehovah, for I am rich!” And whose shepherds spare them not. 
\v 6 For I will no longer spare The inhabitants of the land, saith Jehovah; But, behold, I will deliver the men Every one into the hand of his neighbor, And into the hand of his king; And they shall smite the land, And I will not deliver out of their hand. 
\v 7 So I fed the flock of slaughter, truly a miserable flock. And I took to me two crooks; the one I called Favor, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock. 
\v 8 And I cut off three shepherds in one month; for I was weary of them, and they also abhorred me. 
\v 9 Then I said, I will not feed you; that which dieth, let it die; and that which is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat the flesh of one another. 
\v 10 And I took my staff Favor, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the nations. 
\v 11 And it was broken in that day; and so the poor of the flock, who had regard to me, knew that it was the word of Jehovah. 
\v 12 Then I said to them, If it seem good in your eyes, give me my wages; if not, keep them. And they weighed for my wages thirty shekels of silver. 
\v 13 And Jehovah said to me, Cast it into the treasury, the goodly price at which I was valued by them. And I took the thirty shekels of silver, and cast them into the house of Jehovah, into the treasury. 
\v 14 Then I broke my other crook, even Bands, to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel. 
\v 15 And Jehovah said to me: Take to thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd. 
\v 16 For lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land Who shall not care for those that are perishing, Nor seek that which is gone astray, Nor heal that which is wounded, Nor support that which cannot go; But he shall eat the flesh of the fat, And consume it even to the hoofs. 
\v 17 Woe to the foolish shepherd that leaveth the flock! The sword is upon his arm, and upon his right eye; His arm shall surely be withered, And his right eye shall surely be darkened! 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 The prophecy of the word of Jehovah concerning Israel. Thus saith Jehovah, who stretched out the heavens, And laid the foundation of the earth, And formed the spirit of man within him: 
\v 2 Behold, I make Jerusalem a cup of giddiness to all the nations round about, And for Judah also shall it be In the siege against Jerusalem. 
\v 3 And in that day will I make Jerusalem A burdensome stone for all nations; All that lift it up shall tear themselves, And all the nations of the earth shall gather themselves together against it. 
\v 4 In that day, saith Jehovah, I will smite every horse with amazement, And his rider with madness; I will open mine eyes upon the house of Judah, And every horse of the nations will I smite with blindness. 
\v 5 Then shall the leaders of Judah say in their heart, “Strong are the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Through Jehovah of hosts, their God.” 
\v 6 In that day will I make the leaders of Judah Like a fire-pan among wood, And like a torch of fire in a sheaf, And they shall devour, on the right hand and on the left, All the nations round about. And Jerusalem shall again dwell in her own place at Jerusalem. 
\v 7 Jehovah will also save the tents of Judah first, That the glory of the house of David, And the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, May not magnify itself against Judah. 
\v 8 In that day shall Jehovah defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem, And he that is feeble among them in that day shall be like David, And the house of David shall be as God, As the angel of Jehovah before them. 
\v 9 And it shall come to pass in that day That I will seek to destroy all the nations Which come against Jerusalem. 
\v 10 Then will I pour upon the house of David, And upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, A spirit of supplication, and of prayer; And they shall look to me whom they pierced, And they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, And shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his first-born. 
\v 11 In that day the mourning shall be great in Jerusalem, As the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddo. 
\v 12 And the land shall mourn, every family apart; The family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart; The family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart; 
\v 13 The family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; The family of the house of Shimei apart, and their wives apart; 
\v 14 All the families that remain, Every family apart, and their wives apart. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 In that day there shall be a fountain opened To the house of David, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, For sin and for uncleanness. 
\v 2 And it shall come to pass in that day, Saith Jehovah of hosts, That I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, And they shall no more be remembered; And the prophets also, and the impure spirit, Will I cause to pass out of the land. 
\v 3 And it shall come to pass, when any one shall yet prophesy, That his father and mother shall say to him, Even they that begat him, “Thou shalt not live; For thou hast spoken falsehood in the name of Jehovah.” And his father and mother that begat him shall pierce him through when he prophesieth. 
\v 4 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophet shall be ashamed Every one of his vision when he prophesieth; Neither shall they wear a garment of hair, to deceive. 
\v 5 But each shall say, “I am no prophet; I am a man that tilleth the ground; For a man hath purchased me from my youth.” 
\v 6 And when one shall say to him, “What are these wounds in thy hands?” He shall answer, “Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.” 
\v 7 Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, Even against the man who is my fellow, saith Jehovah of hosts! Smite the shepherd, and let the sheep be scattered! I will also turn my hand against the lambs. 
\v 8 And it shall come to pass in all the land, saith Jehovah, That two parts therein shall be cut off and die; But the third part shall be left therein. 
\v 9 And I will bring the third part through the fire, And will refine them, as silver is refined, And will try them, as gold is tried; They shall call upon me, and I will hear them; I will say, “It is my people.” And they shall say, “Jehovah is our God.”

\v 1 Behold, the day of Jehovah cometh, When thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee. 
\v 2 For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; And the city shall be taken, And the houses shall be rifled, And the women shall be ravished; And half of the city shall go forth into captivity, And the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city. 
\v 3 Then shall Jehovah go forth, And fight against those nations, As he once fought in the day of battle. 
\v 4 And his feet shall stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives, Which is before Jerusalem on the east; And the Mount of Olives shall be cloven in the middle of it, eastward and westward, Into a very great valley; And half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, And half of it toward the south. 
\v 5 And ye shall flee through the valley of my mountains, For the valley of the mountains shall reach to Azal; Yea, ye shall flee, as ye fled before the earthquake In the days of Uzziah, king of Judah. And Jehovah, my God, will come, And all his holy ones with him. 
\v 6 And it shall come to pass in that day That there shall he no light, but cold and ice; 
\v 7 And there shall be one day, (Known to Jehovah is it,) It shall be neither day nor night; But at the time of evening there shall be light. 
\v 8 And it shall come to pass in that day That living waters shall go out from Jerusalem, Half of them toward the eastern sea, And half of them toward the western sea; In summer and in winter shall they be. 
\v 9 And Jehovah shall be king over all the earth; In that day shall Jehovah be one, and his name one. 
\v 10 The whole land shall be turned into a plain, From Geba to Rimmon, south of Jerusalem; And the city shall be exalted and inhabited in her place, From the gate of Benjamin to the place of the former gate, And to the corner gate, And from the tower of Hananeel to the king's wine-presses. 
\v 11 Men shall dwell therein, And there shall be no more destruction; But Jerusalem shall dwell securely. 
\v 12 And this shall be the plague With which Jehovah will smite all the nations Which warred against Jerusalem: Their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, And their eyes shall consume away in their sockets, And their tongue shall consume away in their mouth. 
\v 13 And it shall come to pass in that day, That there shall be a great tumult among them from Jehovah; And they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbor, And his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbor. 
\v 14 And Judah also shall fight against Jerusalem; But the wealth of all the nations round about shall be gathered together, Gold and silver and apparel in great abundance. 
\v 15 And so shall be the plague of the horse, Of the mule, of the camel, and of the ass, And of every beast which shall be in those camps, Even as this plague. 
\v 16 And it shall be, that every one that is left Of all the nations which come against Jerusalem, Even they shall go up, from year to year, To worship the King, Jehovah of hosts, And to keep the feast of tabernacles. 
\v 17 And it shall be that whoso will not go up, Of the families of the earth, to Jerusalem, To worship the King, Jehovah of hosts, Upon them shall be no rain. 
\v 18 And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, Then not for them shall there be water. The plague shall come upon them With which Jehovah shall smite the nations Which go not up to keep the feast of tabernacles. 
\v 19 This shall be the punishment of Egypt, And the punishment of all the nations That come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles. 
\v 20 In that day, upon the bells of the horses Shall be written, “Holy to Jehovah.” And the pots in the house of Jehovah Shall be as the bowls before the altar. 
\v 21 And every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah Shall be holy to Jehovah of hosts; And all that sacrifice shall come, And shall take of them, and seethe therein. And there shall be no more a trader In the house of Jehovah of hosts, in that day.
