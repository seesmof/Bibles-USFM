\v 1 In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, on the first day of the month, came the word of Jehovah by Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua, the son of Josedech, the high-priest, saying, 
\v 2 Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: This people saith, The time is not yet come, the time that the house of Jehovah should be built. 
\v 3 But the word of Jehovah hath come by Haggai the prophet, saying:— 
\v 4 Is it, then, a time for yourselves To dwell in ceiled houses, While this house lieth waste? 
\v 5 Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Consider how it goeth with you! 
\v 6 Ye sow much, and bring in little; Ye eat, but are not full; Ye drink, but are not satisfied; Ye clothe yourselves, but are not warmed; And he that earneth wages earneth them for a purse with holes. 
\v 7 Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Consider how it goeth with you! 
\v 8 Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house, That I may have pleasure therein, And be glorified, saith Jehovah. 
\v 9 Ye look for much, and lo, it cometh to little; And when ye bring it home, I blow it away; And why? saith Jehovah of hosts. Because of my house which lieth waste, While ye run every one to his own house. 
\v 10 Therefore the heaven over you withholdeth the dew, And the earth refuseth her fruit. 
\v 11 And I have called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains; And upon the corn, and the new wine, and the oil; Upon that which the ground bringeth forth, And upon men, and upon cattle, And upon all the labor of the hands. 
\v 12 Then Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua, the son of Josedech, the high-priest, and all the remnant of people, hearkened to the voice of Jehovah their God, and to the words of Haggai the prophet, as Jehovah their God had sent him; and the people feared before Jehovah. 
\v 13 Then spake Haggai, the messenger of Jehovah, by a message from Jehovah to the people, saying, I am with you, saith Jehovah. 
\v 14 And Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua, the son of Josedech, the high-priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of people, so that they came and executed work upon the house of Jehovah of hosts, their God, 
\v 15 on the four and twentieth day of the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.

\v 1 In the seventh month, on the one and twentieth day of the month, came the word of Jehovah by the prophet Haggai, saying: 
\v 2 Speak now to Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua, the son of Josedech, the high-priest, and to the remnant of the people, saying:— 
\v 3 Who is there left among you, That saw this house In its former glory? And what do ye see it now? Is it not as nothing in your eyes? 
\v 4 Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith Jehovah; And be strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high-priest; And be strong, O all ye people of the land, saith Jehovah, and work! For I am with you, saith Jehovah of hosts. 
\v 5 This is the covenant which I made with you when ye came out of Egypt, And my spirit remaineth among you: Fear ye not! 
\v 6 For thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Yet once more, in a short time, I will shake the heavens and the earth, The sea and the dry land. 
\v 7 I will shake all the nations, And here shall come the precious things of all the nations; And I will fill this house with glory, Saith Jehovah of hosts. 
\v 8 Mine is the silver and mine the gold, Saith Jehovah of hosts; 
\v 9 Greater shall be the glory of this latter house than of the former, Saith Jehovah of hosts; And in this place will I give peace, Saith Jehovah of hosts. 
\v 10 On the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of Jehovah by Haggai the prophet, saying, 
\v 11 Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Ask now the law from the priests, saying, 
\v 12 If a man carry holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any food, shall it be holy? And the priests answered and said, No. 
\v 13 Then said Haggai, If a man unclean by a dead body touch any of these things, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It shall be unclean. 
\v 14 Then answered Haggai and said:— So is this people, and so is this nation before me, saith Jehovah; And so is all the work of their hands; And that which they offer there is unclean. 
\v 15 And now, I pray you, consider [[how it hath gone with you]] From that day and upward, From the time before one stone was laid upon another in the temple of Jehovah. 
\v 16 Since that time one hath come to a heap of twenty measures, And there were but ten; One hath come to a vat to draw out fifty vessels from the wine-press, And there were but twenty; 
\v 17 I have smitten you with blasting, with mildew, and with hail, Even all the works of your hands; Yet none among you hath turned to me, saith Jehovah. 
\v 18 Consider, I pray you, From that day and upward, From the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, From the day when the foundation of the temple of Jehovah was laid, Consider ye! 
\v 19 Is there yet seed in the barn? Yea, as yet the vine, and the fig-tree, and pomegranate, and the olive-tree have not borne. But from this day will I bless you. 
\v 20 And the word of Jehovah came the second time to Haggai, on the four and twentieth day of the month, saying, 
\v 21 Speak to Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah, and say:— I will shake the heavens and the earth, 
\v 22 And I will overthrow the thrones of kingdoms, And I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations, And I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them, And the horses and their riders shall come down, One by the sword of the other. 
\v 23 In that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, I will take thee, O Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, my servant, saith Jehovah, And keep thee as a signet-ring; For thee have I chosen, saith Jehovah of hosts.
