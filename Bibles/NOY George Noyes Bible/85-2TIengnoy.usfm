\mt1 THE SECOND EPISTLE OF PAUL THE APOSTLE TO TIMOTHY 
\c 1  
\p
\v 1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus, 
\v 2 to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. 
\v 3 I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, as without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day, 
\v 4 longing to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy; 
\v 5 when I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that it dwelleth in thee also. 
\v 6 For which cause I remind thee to stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the laying on of my hands; 
\v 7 for God gave us not the spirit of cowardice, but of power, and of love, and of admonition. 
\v 8 Be not then ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but endure hardship with me for the gospel through the power of God, 
\v 9 who saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and the grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began, 
\v 10 but is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and incorruption to light through the gospel, 
\v 11 for which I was appointed a herald, and an apostle, and a teacher of the gentiles. 
\v 12 For which cause I suffer also these things. But I am not ashamed; for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which he hath committed to me unto that day. 
\v 13 Hold the pattern of sound words, which thou heardest from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus; 
\v 14 the good trust committed to thee keep through the Holy Spirit which dwelleth in us. 
\v 15 Thou knowest this, that all those in Asia turned away from me, of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes. 
\v 16 The Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, because he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain; but on the contrary, 
\v 17 when he arrived at Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me. 
\v 18 The Lord grant to him that he may find mercy from the Lord in that day: and what services he rendered me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 Thou therefore, my child, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus; 
\v 2 and the things which thou didst hear from me before many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, such as will be able to teach others also. 
\v 3 Endure hardship with me as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. 
\v 4 No one serving as a soldier entangleth himself with the affairs of life, that he may please him who chose him to be a soldier. 
\v 5 And if a man contendeth in the games, he is not crowned, unless he contendeth lawfully. 
\v 6 The husbandman that laboreth must be the first partaker of the fruits. 
\v 7 Understand what I say; for the Lord will give thee apprehension in all things. 
\v 8 Bear in mind Jesus Christ of the seed of David, as raised from the dead, according to my gospel; 
\v 9 in which I suffer hardship even unto bonds as an evil-doer; but the word of God is not bound. 
\v 10 For this cause I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus, with everlasting glory. 
\v 11 True is the saying: for if we died with him, we shall also live with him; 
\v 12 if we endure, we shall also reign with him; if we deny him, he also will deny us; 
\v 13 if we are faithless, he remaineth faithful; for he cannot deny himself. 
\v 14 Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord not to carry on a strife of words, to no useful purpose, but rather to the subverting of the hearers. 
\v 15 Study to present thyself approved unto God, a workman not ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. 
\v 16 But shun the profane babblings; for they will go on to a higher degree of ungodliness; 
\v 17 and their word will eat as doth a canker; of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus, 
\v 18 who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection hath already taken place, and overthrow the faith of some. 
\v 19 Nevertheless God's firm foundation standeth, having this seal, “The Lord knoweth them that are his;” and, “Let every one that nameth the name of the Lord depart from iniquity.” 
\v 20 But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also wooden and earthen ones; and some for honor, and some for dishonor. 
\v 21 If then any one shall purge himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, hallowed, useful for the householder, prepared for every good work. 
\v 22 But flee youthful lusts, and follow righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. 
\v 23 But the foolish and ignorant questionings avoid, knowing that they gender quarrels; 
\v 24 and a servant of the Lord must not quarrel, but be gentle to all, apt in teaching, patient of wrong, 
\v 25 in meekness admonishing those that oppose themselves; if haply God may give them repentance to attain the full knowledge of the truth, 
\v 26 and they may awake to their senses out of the snare of the Devil, by whom they have been taken captive to do his will. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 But know this, that in the last days grievous times will come. 
\v 2 For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without 
\v 3 natural affection, implacable, slanderers, incontinent, fierce, without love for what is good, 
\v 4 betrayers, headstrong, puffed up, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God; 
\v 5 having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof. And from these turn away. 
\v 6 For of these are they who creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away by divers lusts, 
\v 7 ever learning, and never able to come to the full knowledge of the truth. 
\v 8 Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so also do these withstand the truth; men corrupted in their minds, reprobate concerning the faith. 
\v 9 But they will proceed no further; for their folly will be clearly manifest to all, as that of those men was. 
\v 10 But thou art well acquainted with my teaching, manner of life, purpose, faith, long-suffering, love, patience, 
\v 11 persecutions, sufferings; what things came upon me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured, and out of them all the Lord delivered me. 
\v 12 Yea, and all that desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution. 
\v 13 But evil men and impostors will wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. 
\v 14 But do thou continue in the things which thou didst learn and wast assured of, knowing from what teachers thou didst learn them, 
\v 15 and that from a child thou hast known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation, through faith which is in Christ Jesus. 
\v 16 All Scripture is inspired by God, and is profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for discipline in righteousness; 
\v 17 that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto every good work. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 I charge thee before God, and Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom; 
\v 2 preach the word, be urgent in season, out of season, confute, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and teaching. 
\v 3 For the time will come, when they will not endure sound doctrine, but after their own desires will they heap to themselves teachers; because they have itching ears; 
\v 4 and they will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn aside to fables. 
\v 5 But be thou watchful in all things, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fully accomplish thy ministry. 
\v 6 For I am already about to be offered as a sacrifice, and the time of my departure is at hand. 
\v 7 I have fought the good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith; 
\v 8 henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will give to me at that day, and not to me only, but to all those who have loved his appearing. 
\v 9 Use diligence to come to me shortly. 
\v 10 For Demas forsook me, because he loved the present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia. 
\v 11 Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee; for he is useful to me for the ministry. 
\v 12 But Tychicus I sent to Ephesus. 
\v 13 The cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest bring with thee, and the books, especially the parchments. 
\v 14 Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil; the Lord will reward him according to his works; 
\v 15 of whom do thou also beware; for he hath greatly withstood our words. 
\v 16 At my first defence no one came forward with me, but all forsook me. May it not be laid to their charge! 
\v 17 But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me, that the preaching might be fully accomplished by me, and that all the gentiles might hear; and I was delivered out of the lion's mouth. 
\v 18 The Lord will deliver me from every evil deed, and preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom; to whom be the glory for ever and ever. Amen. 
\v 19 Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus. 
\v 20 Erastus remained at Corinth, but Trophimus I left at Miletus sick. 
\v 21 Use diligence to come before winter. Eubulus saluteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren. 
\v 22 The Lord be with thy spirit. Grace be with you.
