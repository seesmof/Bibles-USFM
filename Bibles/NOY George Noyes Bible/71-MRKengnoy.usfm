\mt1 THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST. MARK 
\c 1  
\p
\v 1 The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ; 
\v 2 as it is written in Isaiah the prophet: “Lo! I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way;” 
\v 3 “The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight his paths!” 
\v 4 John the Baptizer appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the remission of sins. 
\v 5 And there went out to him all the country of Judaea, and all they of Jerusalem and were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. 
\v 6 And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a leathern girdle about his loins, and he ate locusts and wild honey. 
\v 7 And he preached, saying, There cometh after me one mightier than I, the latchet of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and loose. 
\v 8 I have baptized you with water; but he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit. 
\v 9 And it came to pass that in those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan. 
\v 10 And immediately on coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens parted, and the Spirit descending as a dove upon him. 
\v 11 And there was a voice from the heavens, “Thou art my beloved Son; with thee I am well pleased.” 
\v 12 And immediately the Spirit driveth him forth into the wilderness. 
\v 13 And he was in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan, and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered to him. 
\v 14 But after John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the glad tidings of God, 
\v 15 [[saying,]] The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent, and believe the glad tidings. 
\v 16 And as he was passing along by the lake of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon dragging a net in the lake; for they were fishers. 
\v 17 And Jesus said to them, Come after me, and I will cause you to become fishers of men. 
\v 18 And immediately they left their nets, and followed him. 
\v 19 And going on a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the boat mending the nets; 
\v 20 and immediately he called them. And leaving their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men, they went after him. 
\v 21 And they enter Capernaum; and immediately on the sabbath he was teaching in the synagogue. 
\v 22 And they were astonished at his teaching; for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes. 
\v 23 And immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out, 
\v 24 saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus of Nazareth? Thou hast come to destroy us; we know who thou art, the Holy One of God. 
\v 25 And Jesus rebuked him, [[saying,]] Be silent, and come out of him. 
\v 26 And the unclean spirit convulsing him, and crying out with a loud voice, came out of him. 
\v 27 And they were all amazed, so that they questioned each other, saying, What is this? New teaching with authority; even the unclean spirits doth he command, and they obey him! 
\v 28 And immediately his fame spread abroad everywhere through the whole surrounding country of Galilee. 
\v 29 And having come out of the synagogue, they immediately entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. 
\v 30 And Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever; and they immediately speak to him about her. 
\v 31 And he went to her, and took her by the hand, and raised her up; and the fever left her, and she waited on them. 
\v 32 And in the evening, when the sun had set, they brought to him all that were sick, and those who were possessed by demons; 
\v 33 and the whole city was assembled at the door. 
\v 34 And he healed many that were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons; and he suffered not the demons to speak, because they knew him. 
\v 35 And rising early, long before day, he went out, and withdrew into a desert place, and there prayed. 
\v 36 And Simon and those with him went in search of him, 
\v 37 and found him. And they say to him, All people are in search of thee. 
\v 38 And he saith to them, Let us go elsewhere into the neighboring towns, that I may preach there also; for, for this I came forth. 
\v 39 And he went, preaching in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and casting out the demons. 
\v 40 And there cometh a leper to him beseeching him, and kneeling down, saying to him, If thou wilt, thou canst cleanse me. 
\v 41 And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and saith, I will; be thou cleansed. 
\v 42 And immediately the leprosy left him, and he was cleansed. 
\v 43 And sternly charging him, he immediately sent him away, 
\v 44 saying to him, See that thou say nothing to any one; but go, show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing what Moses commanded, for a testimony to them. 
\v 45 But he went away, and began to publish it constantly, and to spread the matter abroad, so that Jesus could no more enter a city openly, but was without in desert places; and they came to him from every quarter. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 And after some days he again entered Capernaum; and it was reported that he was in the house. 
\v 2 And many were gathered together, so that there was no longer room for them, even at the door; and he was speaking the word to them. 
\v 3 And they come to him, bringing one that was palsied, borne by four men. 
\v 4 And not being able to bring him to him on account of the crowd, they took off the roof where he was; and when they had broken an opening, they let down the bed whereon the palsied man lay. 
\v 5 And Jesus seeing their faith, saith to the palsied man, Son, thy sins are forgiven. 
\v 6 But there were some of the scribes sitting there and reasoning in their hearts, 
\v 7 Why doth this man speak thus? He blasphemeth; who can forgive sins but God only? 
\v 8 And Jesus immediately perceiving in his spirit that they reasoned thus within themselves, saith to them, Why do ye reason thus in your hearts? 
\v 9 Which is easier? to say to the palsied man, Thy sins are forgiven? or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed and go? 
\v 10 But that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins,—he saith to the palsied man,— 
\v 11 I say to thee, Arise, take up thy bed and go to thy house. 
\v 12 And he arose, and immediately took up the bed and went forth before them all; so that they were all amazed, and gave glory to God, saying, We never saw it thus. 
\v 13 And he went forth again to the lake; and all the multitude came to him, and he taught them. 
\v 14 And passing along, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the custom-house; and he saith to him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him. 
\v 15 And it happened that he was reclining at table in his house; and many publicans and sinners were reclining with Jesus and his disciples; for there were many, and scribes of the Pharisees were also following him. 
\v 16 And when they saw that he was eating with the publicans and sinners, they said to his disciples, Doth he eat and drink with publicans and sinners? 
\v 17 And Jesus hearing it, saith to them, They who are well do not need a physician, but they who are sick. I came not to call righteous men, but sinners. 
\v 18 And the disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting; and they come and say to him, Why do the disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, and thy disciples fast not? 
\v 19 And Jesus said to them, Can the companions of the bridegroom fast, while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast. 
\v 20 But the days will come, when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then will they fast in that day. 
\v 21 No one seweth a patch of undressed cloth on an old garment; for the new piece teareth away from the old garment, and a worse rent is made. 
\v 22 And no one putteth new wine into old skins; for the new wine will burst the skins, and the wine is lost, and the skins. 
\v 23 And it came to pass, that he was going through the grain-fields on the sabbath, and his disciples began, as they went along, to pluck the ears of grain. 
\v 24 And the Pharisees said to him, See, why are they doing on the sabbath that which is not lawful? 
\v 25 And he saith to them, Did ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was hungry, himself and they who were with him? 
\v 26 how he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high-priest, and ate the show-bread, which it is lawful for none but the priests to eat, and gave also to those who were with him? 
\v 27 And he said to them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath. 
\v 28 So that the Son of man is lord even of the sabbath. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 And he entered again into a synagogue; and there was a man there having a withered hand; 
\v 2 and they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath, that they might accuse him. 
\v 3 And he saith to the man having the withered hand, Stand up in the midst. 
\v 4 And he saith to them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they were silent. 
\v 5 And looking round on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith to the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth; and his hand was restored. 
\v 6 And the Pharisees went forth, and immediately had a consultation with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him. 
\v 7 And Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the lake; and a great multitude from Galilee, and from Judaea followed; 
\v 8 and from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond the Jordan, and the people about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they heard what great things he was doing, came to him. 
\v 9 And he gave direction to his disciples, that a boat should be in readiness for him because of the multitude, that they might not throng him. 
\v 10 For he had healed many, so that as many as had plagues pressed upon him to touch him. 
\v 11 And the unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried out, saying, Thou art the Son of God. 
\v 12 And he strictly charged them that they should not make him known. 
\v 13 And he goeth up into the mountain, and calleth to him whom he would; and they came to him. 
\v 14 And he appointed twelve to be with him, and whom he might send forth to preach, 
\v 15 and to have authority to cast out demons. And he appointed the twelve, 
\v 16 and Simon he surnamed Peter; 
\v 17 and James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, that is, Sons of thunder; 
\v 18 and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon of Cana, 
\v 19 and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him. And he cometh into the house. 
\v 20 And again a multitude cometh together, so that they could not so much as eat bread. 
\v 21 And his relations hearing of it went out to lay hold of him; for they said, He is beside himself. 
\v 22 And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, He hath Beelzebul; and, He casteth out the demons through the prince of the demons. 
\v 23 And calling them to him, he said to them in parables: How can Satan cast out Satan? 
\v 24 And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand; 
\v 25 and if a house be divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand; 
\v 26 and if Satan rise up against himself, he is divided, and cannot stand, but hath an end. 
\v 27 Moreover, no one can enter into a strong man's house, and plunder his goods, unless he first bind the strong man; and then he will plunder his house. 
\v 28 Truly do I say to you, All sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and the blasphemies wherewith they shall blaspheme; 
\v 29 but he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Spirit hath no forgiveness forever, but is exposed to everlasting sin.— 
\v 30 Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit. 
\v 31 And his mother and his brothers came; and, standing without, sent to him, to call him. 
\v 32 And a multitude was sitting about him; and they say to him, Lo! thy mother and thy brothers and thy sisters are without, seeking for thee. 
\v 33 And he answering saith to them, Who is my mother, and my brothers? 
\v 34 And looking round on those who sat about him, he saith, Behold my mother and my brothers. 
\v 35 Whoever shall do the will of God, he is my brother, and sister, and mother. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 And again he began to teach by the shore of the lake; and there was gathered to him a very great multitude, so that he went into a boat, and sat down in it upon the lake; and all the multitude was by the lake on the land. 
\v 2 And he taught them many things in parables, and said to them in his teaching, 
\v 3 Hearken: Behold, a sower went forth to sow. 
\v 4 And it came to pass, as he sowed some seeds fell by the way-side; and the birds came and devoured them. 
\v 5 And others fell on rocky ground, where they had not much earth; and they sprung up immediately, because they had no depth of earth. 
\v 6 But when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away. 
\v 7 And others fell among thorns; and the thorns grew up, and choked them, and they yielded no fruit. 
\v 8 And others fell on good ground, and shooting up and growing yielded fruit; and bore as much as thirty, and sixty, and a hundred fold. 
\v 9 And he said, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. 
\v 10 And when he was in private, they who were about him, with the twelve, asked him about the parables. 
\v 11 And he said to them, To you hath been given the mystery of the kingdom of God; but to them, who are without, all things are done in parables; t 
\v 12 hat seeing they may see, and not perceive, and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest they should turn, and be forgiven. 
\v 13 And he saith to them, Know ye not this parable? and how will ye know all the parables? 
\v 14 The sower soweth the word. 
\v 15 And these are they by the wayside, those where the word is sown, and when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in them. 
\v 16 And these in like manner are they that are sown on the rocky places, those, who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with joy, 
\v 17 and have no root in themselves, but endure only for a time; then, when affliction or persecution ariseth on account of the word, they immediately fall away. 
\v 18 And others are they that are sown among the thorns; these are they who hear the word, 
\v 19 but the cares of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful. 
\v 20 And these are they who are sown on the good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it; and bear fruit, thirty, sixty, and a hundred fold. 
\v 21 And he said to them, Is a lamp brought to be put under the bushel, or under the bed, and not to be set on the lamp-stand? 
\v 22 For there is nothing secret, unless to be made known; nor was any thing hidden, but that it should come to light. 
\v 23 If any one hath ears to hear, let him hear. 
\v 24 And he said to them, Take heed what ye hear. With what measure ye mete, it will be measured to you, and more will be added to you. 
\v 25 For he that hath, to him will be given; and he that hath not, from him will be taken away even what he hath. 
\v 26 And he said, Thus is the kingdom of God, as when a man has cast seed upon the ground, 
\v 27 and sleeps and rises night and day, and the seed springs and grows up, he knows not how. 
\v 28 For the earth brings forth fruit of itself, first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear. 
\v 29 But when the fruit puts itself forth, immediately he sends out the sickle, because the harvest is come. 
\v 30 And he said, To what shall we liken the kingdom of God? or under what comparison shall we set it forth? 
\v 31 It is like a grain of mustard, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that are in the earth; 
\v 32 and when it is sown, it grows up, and becomes greater than all the herbs, and puts forth great branches, so that the birds of the air can lodge under its shade. 
\v 33 And with many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear. 
\v 34 But without a parable he did not speak to them; but in private he explained all things to his own disciples. 
\v 35 And on the same day, when the evening was come, he saith to them, Let us pass over to the other side. 
\v 36 And leaving the multitude, they take him with them, as he was, in the boat; and there were also other boats with him. 
\v 37 And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves heat into the boat, so that it was already filling. 
\v 38 And he was in the stern, asleep on the pillow; and they awake him, and say to him, Teacher, carest thou not that we are perishing? 
\v 39 And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said to the waves, Peace! be still! And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. 
\v 40 And he said to them, Why are ye so fearful? How is it that ye have not faith? 
\v 41 And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, Who then is this, that even the wind and the waves obey him? 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 And they came to the other side of the lake, into the country of the Gerasenes. 
\v 2 And when he had come out of the boat, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit, 
\v 3 who had his dwelling in the tombs; and not even with a chain could any one bind him any longer; 
\v 4 because he had often been bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been snapped asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces; and no one could master him; 
\v 5 and continually, night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out, and cutting himself, with stones. 
\v 6 And seeing Jesus afar off, he ran and bowed down before him, 
\v 7 and cried out with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, do not torment me. 
\v 8 For he was saying to him, Unclean spirit, come out from the man. 
\v 9 And he asked him, What is thy name? And he saith to him, Legion is my name; for we are many. 
\v 10 And he besought him much not to send them out of the country. 
\v 11 Now there was there, by the mountain, a great herd of swine feeding. 
\v 12 And they besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them. 
\v 13 And he gave them leave. And the unclean spirits coming out, entered into the swine; and the herd rushed down the steep into the lake, about two thousand, and were drowned in the lake. 
\v 14 And they that fed them fled, and told the news in the city and in the country. And they came to see what had been done. 
\v 15 And they come to Jesus, and see him who had been possessed by demons, sitting, clothed, and in his right mind,—him who had had the legion; and they were afraid. 
\v 16 And they who saw it told them how it befell him that was possessed by the demons, and concerning the swine. 
\v 17 And they began to beseech him to depart from their borders. 
\v 18 And when he was going on board the boat, he that had been possessed by the demons besought him that be might be with him. 
\v 19 And he did not permit him, but said to him, Go to thy house to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and that he hath had compassion on thee. 
\v 20 And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him; and all wondered. 
\v 21 And when Jesus had crossed again in the boat to the ether side, a great multitude gathered about him; and he was by the lake. 
\v 22 And there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and seeing him, he fell at his feet, 
\v 23 and besought him much, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of death; I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be saved and live. 
\v 24 And he went with him; and a great multitude followed him, and pressed upon him. 
\v 25 And a woman, who had had an issue of blood twelve years, 
\v 26 and had undergone much at the hands of many physicians, and spent all that she had, and was not at all benefited, but rather grew worse, 
\v 27 having heard about Jesus, came in the crowd behind, and touched his garment. 
\v 28 For she said, If I touch even his garments, I shall be made well. 
\v 29 And immediately the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she perceived in her body that she was cured of her plague. 
\v 30 And Jesus immediately perceiving in himself that power had gone out from him, turned round in the crowed, and said, Who touched my garments? 
\v 31 And his disciples said to him, Thou seest the multitude pressing on thee, and dost thou say, Who touched me? 
\v 32 And he looked round to see her who had done this. 
\v 33 But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth. 
\v 34 And he said to her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee well; go in peace, and be recovered from thy plague. 
\v 35 While he was yet speaking, there came from the house I of the ruler of the synagogue some who said, Thy daughter is dead; why dost thou trouble the Teacher any further? 
\v 36 And Jesus, overhearing those words, saith to the ruler of the synagogue, Fear not; only believe. 
\v 37 And he suffered no one to follow him except Peter and James, and John the brother of James. 
\v 38 And they come to the house of the ruler of the synagogue; and he seeth a tumult, and people weeping and wailing greatly. 
\v 39 And going in, he saith to them, Why do ye make this confusion and weeping? The child is not dead, but is sleeping. 
\v 40 And they laughed him to scorn. But putting them all out, he taketh the father of the child, and the mother, and those who were with him, and entereth where the child was. 
\v 41 And taking hold of the hand of the child, he saith to her, Talitha, kum; which is, when interpreted, Damsel, I say to thee, arise! 
\v 42 And immediately the damsel arose and walked; for she was twelve years old. And immediately they were greatly astonished. 
\v 43 And he charged them strictly that no one should know it, and bade that something should be given her to eat. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1 And he went out from thence, and cometh into his own country; and his disciples follow him. 
\v 2 And when the sabbath was come, he began to teach in the synagogue. And most people when they heard him were astonished, saying, Whence hath this man these things? And what is the wisdom which is given him? And how is it that such miracles are wrought by his hands? 
\v 3 Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James, and Joses, and Judah, and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us? And they took offence at him. 
\v 4 And Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor except in his own country, and among his own kindred, and in his own house. 
\v 5 And he could not do any miracle there, except that he laid his hand upon a few sick persons, and cured them. 
\v 6 And he wondered at their want of faith. And he went about the surrounding villages teaching. 
\v 7 And he calleth to him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over the unclean spirits; 
\v 8 and commanded them that they should take nothing for the way but a staff only; no bread, no bag, no money in their girdle; 
\v 9 but to be shod with sandals; and, Do not put on two coats. 
\v 10 And he said to them, Wherever ye enter a house, there abide fill ye leave that place. 
\v 11 And whatever place shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye go thence, shake off the dust under your feet as a testimony to them. 
\v 12 And they went out and preached that men should repent; 
\v 13 and they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many sick persons, and healed them. 
\v 14 And king Herod heard of him (for his name was spread abroad), and he said, John the Baptizer hath risen from the dead, and therefore do these powers work in him. But others said, It is Elijah. 
\v 15 And others said, It is a prophet, as one of the prophets. 
\v 16 But Herod hearing of it said, John, whom I beheaded, hath risen again. 
\v 17 For Herod himself had sent forth and seized John, and bound him in prison, on account of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife; for he had married her. 
\v 18 For John had said to Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife. 
\v 19 And Herodias was enraged against him, and wished to put him to death, but could not. 
\v 20 For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and was regardful of him; and on hearing him, was in much anxiety, and listened to him gladly. 
\v 21 And a convenient day having come, when Herod on his birthday made a supper for his nobles and chief captains and the principal men of Galilee, 
\v 22 and the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and those at table with him; and the king said to the damsel, Ask of me whatever thou wilt, and I will give it thee. 
\v 23 And he swore to her, Whatever thou shalt ask of me, I will give thee, to the half of my kingdom. 
\v 24 And she went out and said to her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptizer. 
\v 25 And she came in immediately with haste to the king, and asked, saying, I desire that thou wilt give me immediately on a platter the head of John the Baptist. 
\v 26 And the king was exceedingly sorry; but on account of his oaths, and of those at table with him, he would not refuse her. 
\v 27 And the king immediately sent one of his guards, and ordered his head to be brought. And he went and beheaded him in the prison, 
\v 28 and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the damsel; and the damsel gave it to her mother. 
\v 29 And his disciples, when they heard of it, came and took up his body, and laid it in a tomb. 
\v 30 And the apostles gather together to Jesus, and told him all which they had done and taught. 
\v 31 And he saith to them, Come ye by yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while. For there were many coming and going; and they had no leisure, even to eat. 
\v 32 And they went away into a desert place in the boat apart. 
\v 33 And many saw them departing, and knew them, and ran together on foot thither from all the cities, and arrived before them. 
\v 34 And when he came forth, he saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion for them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd; and he began to teach them many things. 
\v 35 And late in the day his disciples came to him, and said, This is a desert place, and it is now late; 
\v 36 send them away, that they may go into the surrounding fields and villages, and buy themselves something to eat. 
\v 37 But he answering said to them, Give ye them to eat. And they say to him, Shall we go and buy two hundred denaries' worth of bread, and give them to eat? 
\v 38 He saith to them, How many loaves have ye? Go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes. 
\v 39 And he ordered them to make all lie down in companies upon the green grass. 
\v 40 And they lay down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties. 
\v 41 And taking the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven and blessed, and broke the loaves, and gave them to the disciples to set before them; and the two fishes he divided among them all. 
\v 42 And they all ate, and were filled. 
\v 43 And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes. 
\v 44 And they who ate of the loaves were five thousand men. 
\v 45 And he immediately constrained his disciples to get into the boat, and to go before to the other side to Bethsaida, while he sent the multitude away. 
\v 46 And when he had taken leave of them, he went away into the mountain to pray. 
\v 47 And when evening came, the boat was in the midst of the lake; and he was alone on the land. 
\v 48 And when he saw them toiling hard in rowing, for the wind was against them, about the fourth watch of the night he cometh to them, walking upon the lake. And he would have passed by them; 
\v 49 but they, seeing him walking upon the lake, thought it was a spectre, and cried out. 
\v 50 For they all saw him, and were terrified. But he immediately spoke with them, and saith to them, Be of good cheer; it is I, be not afraid. 
\v 51 And he went up to them into the boat, and the wind ceased. And they were exceedingly astonished, beyond measure. 
\v 52 For they did not consider the matter of the loaves; but their heart was hardened. 
\v 53 And crossing over, they came to land, to Gennesaret; and anchored there. 
\v 54 And when they had come out of the boat, the people immediately knowing who he was, 
\v 55 ran through all that region, and began to carry about on beds those that were sick to the place where they heard he was. 
\v 56 And wherever he entered into villages or cities or the open country, they laid the sick in the market-places, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the fringe of his garment; and as many as touched him were made well. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1 And there come together to him the Pharisees, and some of the scribes, who came from Jerusalem; 
\v 2 and seeing some of his disciples eating bread with defiled, that is, unwashed hands, 
\v 3 (for the Pharisees, and all the Jews, unless they wash their hands often, do not eat, holding fast the tradition of the elders; 
\v 4 and on coming from the marketplace, unless they bathe, they do not eat; and there are many other things which they have received to hold, the dipping of cups, and pitchers, and brazen vessels;) 
\v 5 then the Pharisees and scribes ask him, Why do not thy disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with defiled hands? 
\v 6 And he said to them, Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written, “This people honoreth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. 
\v 7 But in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.” 
\v 8 Laying aside, the commandment of God, ye hold fast the tradition of men. 
\v 9 And he said to them, Full well do ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your tradition! 
\v 10 For Moses said, “Honor thy father and thy mother;” and, “He that curseth father or mother, let him surely die.” 
\v 11 But ye say, If a man say to his father or mother, Whatever thou mightst receive in aid from me is Corban, that is, a gift to God, [[he is not bound by the command. Thus]] 
\v 12 ye suffer him no longer to do anything for his father or his mother; 
\v 13 making void the word of God by your tradition, which ye have handed down; and many such things ye do. 
\v 14 And again calling the multitude to him, he said to them, Hearken to me all of you, and understand. 
\v 15 Nothing that entereth into a man from without can defile him; but the things that come out of him are what defile a man. 
\v 16  
\v 17 And when he had gone into the house from the crowd, his disciples asked him concerning the parable. 
\v 18 And he saith to them, Are ye too so without discernment? Do ye not understand that whatever thing from without entereth into a man, cannot defile him? 
\v 19 because it entereth not into his heart, but into the stomach; and goeth out into the drain, which cleanseth all kinds of food. 
\v 20 And he said, That which cometh out of a man, that defileth a man. 
\v 21 For from within, out of the heart of men, come forth evil thoughts, fornications, 
\v 22 thefts, murders, adulteries, covetousness, iniquities, deceit, wantonness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness. 
\v 23 All these evil things come from within, and defile a man. 
\v 24 And rising up, he departed thence into the borders of Tyre; and entering into a house, he desired that no one should know it; but he could not escape notice. 
\v 25 But a woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, immediately hearing of him, came in, and fell at his feet. 
\v 26 The woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast out the demon from her daughter. 
\v 27 And he said to her, Let the children be filled first; for it is not well to take the children's bread and throw it to the little dogs. 
\v 28 But she answered, and saith to him, Yea, Lord; even the little dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs. 
\v 29 And he said to her, For this saying go thy way; the demon hath gone out of thy daughter. 
\v 30 And going away to her house, she found the child laid upon the bed, and the demon gone out. 
\v 31 And again leaving the borders of Tyre, he came through Sidon to the lake of Galilee, through the midst of the borders of Decapolis. 
\v 32 And they bring to him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech, and beseech him to lay his hand upon him. 
\v 33 And taking him aside from the multitude, he put his fingers into his ears, and having spit, touched his tongue; 
\v 34 and looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith to him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened. 
\v 35 And his ears were opened; and the string of his tongue was immediately loosed, and he spoke plain. 
\v 36 And he charged them to tell no one; but the more he charged them, the more did they publish it. 
\v 37 And they were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well; he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1 In those days, there being again a great multitude, and they having nothing to eat, he called the disciples to him, and saith to them, 
\v 2 I have compassion on the multitude, because they have remained with me now three days, and they have nothing to eat. 
\v 3 And if I send them away fasting to their houses, they will faint on the road; and some of them have come from altar. 
\v 4 And his disciples answered him, Whence can ally one satisfy these men with bread here in a wilderness? 
\v 5 And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven. 
\v 6 And he ordered the multitude to lie down on the ground; and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and broke, and gave to his disciples to set before them; and they set them before the multitude. 
\v 7 And they had a few small fishes; and having blessed them, he set them before them. 
\v 8 And they ate, and were filled; and they took up of the fragments that remained, seven baskets. 
\v 9 And they were about four thousand; and he sent them away. 
\v 10 And immediately going on board the boat with his disciples, he came into the region of Dalmanutha. 
\v 11 And the Pharisees came out, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, trying him. 
\v 12 And sighing deeply in his spirit, he saith, Why doth this generation seek for a sign? Truly do I say to you, A sign will not he given to this generation. 
\v 13 And leaving them, he again went on board and crossed to the other side. 
\v 14 And they had forgotten to take bread, and had not in the boat with them more than one loaf. 
\v 15 And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and the leaven of Herod. 
\v 16 And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have no bread. 
\v 17 And knowing it, he saith to them, Why are ye reasoning, because ye have no bread? Do ye not yet perceive nor understand? Have ye your mind still blinded? 
\v 18 Having eyes, do ye not see? and having ears, do ye not hear? And do ye not remember, 
\v 19 when I broke the five loaves among the five thousand, and how many baskets full of fragments ye took up? They say to him, Twelve. 
\v 20 When also the seven among the four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments did ye take up? And they say, Seven. 
\v 21 And he said to them, Do ye not yet understand? 
\v 22 And they come to Bethsaida. And they bring to him a blind man, and beseech him to touch him. 
\v 23 And taking the blind man by the hand, he led him out of the village; and spitting on his eyes, and putting his hands on him, he asked him if he saw anything. 
\v 24 And he looked up, and said, I can see men, for I see them as trees, walking. 
\v 25 Then he again put his hands on his eyes, and he saw clearly, and was restored, and saw all things distinctly. 
\v 26 And he sent him away to his house, saying, Go not into the village. 
\v 27 And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the villages of Caesarea Philippi. And on the way he asked his disciples, saying to them, Who do men say that I am? 
\v 28 And they answered him, saying, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and others, One of the prophets. 
\v 29 And he asked them, But who do ye say that I am? Peter answering saith to him, Thou art the Christ. 
\v 30 And he strictly charged them to tell no one concerning him. 
\v 31 And he began to teach them that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes, and be put to death, and after three days rise again; 
\v 32 and he told them this plainly. And Peter, taking him aside, began to rebuke him. 
\v 33 But he turning about and looking at his disciples, rebuked Peter, and saith, Get thee behind me, Satan! for thy thoughts are not on the things of God, but on those of men. 
\v 34 And calling the multitude to him with his disciples also, he said to them, Whoever chooseth to follow me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. 
\v 35 For whoever chooseth to save his life, will lose it; but whoever shall lose his life for the sake of me and of the glad tidings, will save it. 
\v 36 For what doth it profit a man to gain the whole world, and forfeit his life? 
\v 37 For what can a man give as an exchange for his life? 
\v 38 For whoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him will also the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 And he said to them, Truly do I say to you, There are some of those standing here who will not taste of death, till they have seen that the kingdom of God hath come with power. 
\v 2 And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter and James and John, and leadeth them up into a high mountain apart by themselves; and he was transfigured before them. 
\v 3 And his garments became glistening, very white, so as no fuller on earth can whiten. 
\v 4 And there appeared to them Elijah with Moses; and they were talking with Jesus. 
\v 5 And Peter answering saith to Jesus, Rabbi, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tents, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah. 
\v 6 For he knew not what to answer; for they were struck with terror. 
\v 7 And there came a cloud overshadowing them; and a voice came out of the cloud, This is my beloved Son; hear him. 
\v 8 And suddenly looking round, they no longer saw any one but Jesus alone with themselves. 
\v 9 And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them to give no account of what they had seen to any one, till the Son of man should have risen from the dead. 
\v 10 And they kept these words in mind, questioning one another what rising from the dead might mean. 
\v 11 And they asked him, saying, How is it that the Pharisees and scribes say that Elijah must come first? 
\v 12 And he said to them, Elijah cometh first, and restoreth all things. And how hath it been written of the Son of man? that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought. 
\v 13 But I say to you that Elijah hath come, and they have done to him whatever they would; as it hath been written concerning him. 
\v 14 And coming to the disciples, they saw a great multitude about them, and scribes debating with them. 
\v 15 And immediately the whole multitude on seeing him was struck with awe, and running to him, saluted him. 
\v 16 And he asked them, About what are ye debating with them? 
\v 17 And one of the multitude answered him, Teacher, I have brought to thee my son, who hath a dumb spirit. 
\v 18 And wherever it seizeth hold of him, it throweth him down; and he foameth and gnasheth his teeth; and he pineth away. And I spoke to thy disciples to cast it out, and they were not able. 
\v 19 He answereth and saith to them, O unbelieving generation! How long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him to me. 
\v 20 And they brought him to him. And as soon as he saw him, the spirit convulsed him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed, foaming. 
\v 21 And he asked his father, How long hath it been thus with him? And he said, From a child; 
\v 22 and it hath often cast him both into fire, and into water, to destroy him; but if thou art able to do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us. 
\v 23 Jesus said to him, If thou art able? All things are possible for him that believeth. 
\v 24 The father of the child immediately cried out and said, I believe; help thou my unbelief. 
\v 25 And Jesus seeing that the multitude came running together, rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, Dumb and deaf spirit, I command thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him. 
\v 26 And uttering a cry, and convulsing him much, it came out of him. And he became as one dead; so that very many said, He is dead. 
\v 27 But Jesus, taking hold of his hand, raised him, and he stood up. 
\v 28 And when he had come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast it out? 
\v 29 And he said to them, This kind can go out by nothing, except by prayer. 
\v 30 And departing thence, they passed through Galilee; and he would not that any one should know it. 
\v 31 For he taught his disciples, and said to them, The Son of man is about to be delivered up into the hands of men, and they will put him to death; and when he hath been put to death, after three days he will rise again. 
\v 32 But they understood not what he said, and were afraid to ask him. 
\v 33 And they came to Capernaum; and having come into the house, he asked them, About what were ye disputing on the road? 
\v 34 But they were silent; for on the road they had been disputing with one another, who was greatest. 
\v 35 And sitting down, he called the twelve, and saith to them, If any one desire to be first, he will be last of all, and servant of all. 
\v 36 And he took a child, and placed him in the midst of them, and taking him in his arms, he said to them, 
\v 37 Whoever receiveth one of these children in my name, receiveth me; and whoever receiveth me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me. 
\v 38 John said to him, Teacher, we saw one casting out demons in thy name who followeth not us; and we forbade him, because he did not follow us. 
\v 39 But Jesus said, Forbid him not. For no one, who shall do a miracle in my name, can readily speak evil of me. 
\v 40 For he that is not against us is for us. 
\v 41 For whoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye belong to Christ, truly do I say to you, he will not lose his reward. 
\v 42 And whoever shall cause one of these little ones that believe to fall away, it would be better for him to have a great millstone hung round his neck, and be cast into the sea. 
\v 43 And if thy hand cause thee to fall away, cut it off. It is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having the two hands to go away into hell, into the fire that is unquenchable. 
\v 44  
\v 45 And if thy foot is causing thee to fall away, cut it off; it is better for thee to enter into life lame, than having the two feet to be cast into hell. 
\v 46  
\v 47 And if thine eye is causing thee to fall away, pluck it out; it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell, 
\v 48 where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. 
\v 49 For every one will be salted with fire. 
\v 50 Salt is good; but if the salt have lost its saltness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1 And departing thence, he cometh into the borders of Judaea, and to the other side of the Jordan; and multitudes again come together to him; and, as he was wont, he again taught them. 
\v 2 And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him whether it was lawful for a man to put away his wife, trying him. 
\v 3 And he answering said to them, What did Moses command you? 
\v 4 And they said, Moses permitted to write a bill of divorcement, and to put her away. 
\v 5 And Jesus said to them, On account of your hardness of heart he wrote you this command. 
\v 6 But, from the beginning of the creation, [[God]] made them male and female. 
\v 7 “For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother; 
\v 8 and the two shall become one flesh.” So they are no longer two, but one flesh. 
\v 9 What therefore God joined together, let not man put asunder. 
\v 10 And in the house his disciples asked him again about this matter. 
\v 11 And he saith to them, Whoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery against her. 
\v 12 And if she put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery. 
\v 13 And they brought children to him, that he might touch them; and the disciples rebuked those that brought them. 
\v 14 But Jesus seeing it was much displeased, and said to them, Suffer the children to come to me; forbid them not; for to such belongeth the kingdom of God. 
\v 15 Truly do I say to you, Whoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a child, will not enter therein. 
\v 16 And he took them in his arms, and blessed them, laying his hands upon them. 
\v 17 And as he was going out into the way, a certain one running up and kneeling to him, asked him, Good teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit everlasting life? 
\v 18 And Jesus said to him, Why dost thou call me good? None is good but one, that is, God. 
\v 19 Thou knowest the commandments, “Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honor thy father and thy mother.” 
\v 20 And he said to him, Teacher, all these have I kept from my youth. 
\v 21 And Jesus looking at him, loved him, and said to him, One thing thou lackest; go, sell whatever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me. 
\v 22 But his countenance fell at that saying, and he went away sorrowful; for he had great possessions. 
\v 23 And Jesus, looking round, saith to his disciples, How hardly shall they who have riches enter the kingdom t of God! 
\v 24 And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answering again saith to them, Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God! 
\v 25 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God. 
\v 26 And they were beyond measure astonished, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved? 
\v 27 Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God; for all things are possible with God. 
\v 28 Peter began to say to him, Lo! we left all, and have followed thee. 
\v 29 Jesus said, Truly do I say to you, There is no one who hath left house, or brothers, or sisters, or mother, or father, or children, or lands, for the sake of me and of the glad tidings, 
\v 30 who will not receive a hundredfold in the time that now is, houses, and brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions, and in the world to come everlasting life. 
\v 31 But many who are first will be last; and the last first. 
\v 32 And they were on the road, going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus was leading the way; and they were amazed, and they that followed were afraid. And again taking the twelve aside, he began to tell them what things were about to befall him: 
\v 33 Lo! we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man will be delivered up to the chief priests and to the scribes; and they will condemn him to death, and deliver him up to the gentiles; 
\v 34 and they will mock him, and spit upon him, and scourge him, and put him to death; and after three days he will rise again. 
\v 35 And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come to him, saying to him, Teacher, we would that thou shouldst do for us whatever we shall ask thee. 
\v 36 And he said to them, What would ye that I should do for you? 
\v 37 And they said to him, Grant to us that we may sit, one on thy right hand and one on thy left, in thy glory. 
\v 38 But Jesus said to them, Ye know not what ye ask. Can ye drink the cup that I drink, or be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? 
\v 39 And they said to him, We can. And Jesus said to them, Ye will drink the cup that I drink, and ye will be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with; 
\v 40 but to sit on my right hand or on my left is not mine to give, but it will be given to those for whom it hath been prepared. 
\v 41 And the ten hearing it began to be much displeased with James and John. 
\v 42 And Jesus, calling them to him, saith to them, Ye know that they who are accounted to rule over the nations lord it over them, and their great men exercise a strict authority over them. 
\v 43 But it is not so among you; but whoever desireth to become great among you, will be your minister; 
\v 44 and whoever of you desireth to become first, will be servant of all; 
\v 45 for even the Son of man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many. 
\v 46 And they come to Jericho; and as he was going out of Jericho with his disciples and a great multitude, the son of Timaeus, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the wayside. 
\v 47 And hearing that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out and say, Son of David, Jesus, have pity on me! 
\v 48 And many sharply bade him be silent; but he cried out the more, Son of David, have pity on me! 
\v 49 And Jesus stopped, and said, Call him. And they call the blind man, saying to him, Be of good courage, rise, he calleth thee. 
\v 50 And throwing off his garment, he leaped up, and came to Jesus. 
\v 51 And Jesus answering said to him, What dost thou wish me to do for thee? The blind man said to him, My master, to restore my sight. 
\v 52 And Jesus said to him, Go; thy faith hath saved thee. And he immediately received his sight, and followed him on the road. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 And when they were drawing near to Jerusalem and to Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples, 
\v 2 and saith to them, Go to the village over against you; and immediately on entering it ye will find a colt tied, on which no man hath yet sat; loose and bring it. 
\v 3 And if any one say to you, Why do ye this? say, The Lord hath need of it, and will immediately send it back hither. 
\v 4 And they went, and found the colt tied by the door without, on the street; and they loose it. 
\v 5 And some of those who were standing there said to them, What are ye about, loosing the colt? 
\v 6 And they said to them as Jesus had commanded; and they let them go. 
\v 7 And they bring the colt to Jesus, and put their garments on it; and he sat upon it. 
\v 8 And many spread their garments on the road; and others boughs, having cut them from the fields. 
\v 9 And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, Hosanna! Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord! 
\v 10 Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David! Hosanna in the highest heavens! 
\v 11 And he entered Jerusalem, and the temple; and having looked round on all things, the evening being now come, he went out to Bethany, with the twelve. 
\v 12 And on the morrow, when they had come from Bethany, he was hungry; 
\v 13 and seeing a fig-tree afar off having leaves, he went to see whether he might find anything on it; and on coming to it he found nothing but leaves; for the season of figs had not come. 
\v 14 And he answering said to it, Let no one eat fruit from thee henceforth for ever. And his disciples heard him. 
\v 15 And they come to Jerusalem. And he went into the temple, and began to cast out those who sold and bought in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of those who sold the doves; 
\v 16 and he suffered no one to carry any vessel through the temple. 
\v 17 And he taught, and said to them, Is it not written, “My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations? but ye have made it a den of robbers.” 
\v 18 And the chief priests and the scribes heard it, and sought how they might destroy him; for they feared him; because all the multitude was astonished at his teaching. 
\v 19 And when it became late, he went out of the city. 
\v 20 And in the morning, as they were passing by, they saw the fig-tree withered from the roots. 
\v 21 And Peter remembered and said to him, Rabbi, see! the fig-tree which thou didst curse is withered away. 
\v 22 And Jesus answering saith to them, Have faith in God. 
\v 23 Truly do I say to you, that whoever shall say to this mountain, Be thou taken up, and cast into the sea, and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that what he saith will come to pass, he shall have it. 
\v 24 Therefore I say to you, All things whatever ye pray for and ask, believe that ye have obtained, and ye shall have them. 
\v 25 And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have aught against any one, that your Father who is in heaven may also forgive you your trespasses. 
\v 26  
\v 27 And they come again to Jerusalem. And as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests and the scribes and the elders; 
\v 28 and they said to him, By what authority doest thou these things? or who gave thee this authority to do these things? 
\v 29 And Jesus said to them, I will ask you one question; and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things. 
\v 30 The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men? Answer me. 
\v 31 And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we say, From heaven, he will say, Why then did ye not believe him? 
\v 32 But shall we say, From men? They feared the people; for all regarded John as truly a prophet. 
\v 33 And they answered and said to Jesus, We do not know. And Jesus saith to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 And he began to speak to them in parables: A man planted a vineyard, and set a hedge about it, and dug a wine-vat, and built a tower; and let it out to husbandmen, and went abroad. 
\v 2 And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruits of the vineyard. 
\v 3 And they took him, and beat him, and sent him away empty-handed. 
\v 4 And again he sent to them another servant; and him they wounded in the head, and treated shamefully. 
\v 5 And he sent another; and him they killed; and many others, beating some, and killing some. 
\v 6 Still he had one beloved son; he sent him last to them, saying, They will respect my son. 
\v 7 But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours. 
\v 8 And they took him and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard. 
\v 9 What will the lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to others. 
\v 10 And have ye not read this scripture: “The stone which the builders rejected, the same hath become the cornerstone; 
\v 11 from the Lord did this come, and it is marvelous in our eyes”? 
\v 12 And they sought to seize him, but feared the multitude; for they knew that he spoke the parable against them. And they left him, and went away. 
\v 13 And they send to him some of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to ensnare him in speech. 
\v 14 And they come and say to him, Teacher, we know that thou art true, and carest for no one; for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not? 
\v 15 Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, seeing their hypocrisy, said to them, Why are ye trying me? Bring me a denary, that I may see it. 
\v 16 And they brought one. And he saith to them, Whose is this image and inscription? And they said to him, Caesar's. 
\v 17 And Jesus said to them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marveled at him exceedingly. 
\v 18 Then come to him Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying, 
\v 19 Teacher, Moses wrote to us, “If a man's brother die, and leave a wife and no child, his brother shall take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.” 
\v 20 There were seven brothers; and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed. 
\v 21 And the second took her and died, leaving no seed; and the third likewise. 
\v 22 And the seven left no seed. Last of all, the woman also died. 
\v 23 In the resurrection, when they have risen, of which of them will she be wife? for the seven had her for a wife. 
\v 24 Jesus said to them, Do ye not err on this account, that ye know not the Scriptures, nor the power of God? 
\v 25 For when they have risen from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels in heaven. 
\v 26 And concerning the dead, that they are raised, have ye not read in the book of Moses, at the Bush, how God spoke to him, saying, “I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob”? 
\v 27 He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. Ye err greatly. 
\v 28 And one of the scribes came up, having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which commandment is first of all? 
\v 29 Jesus answered, The first is, “Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord; 
\v 30 and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength.” 
\v 31 The second is this: “Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.” There is no other commandment greater than these. 
\v 32 And the scribe said to him, In truth, Teacher, thou hast well said, that He is one, and that there is no other but he; 
\v 33 and to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the strength, and to love one's neighbor as one's self, is more than all the whole burnt-offerings and the sacrifices. 
\v 34 And Jesus, perceiving that he answered wisely, said to him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And after this no one dared to question him. 
\v 35 And Jesus answered and said, while he was teaching in the temple, How is it that the scribes say, that the Christ is David's son? 
\v 36 David himself said in the Holy Spirit, “The Lord said to my lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.” 
\v 37 David himself calleth him lord; and how can he be his son? And the great multitude heard him gladly. 
\v 38 And he said in his teaching, Beware of the scribes, who like to walk about in long robes, and love salutations in the markets, 
\v 39 and the chief seats in the synagogues, and the first places at feasts; 
\v 40 who devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers. These will receive a far greater condemnation. 
\v 41 And he sat over against the treasury, and was beholding how the people cast money into the treasury. And many that were rich were casting in much. 
\v 42 And a certain poor widow came and threw in two mites, which make a farthing. 
\v 43 And he called to him his disciples, and said to them, Truly do I say to you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than all those who are casting into the treasury. 
\v 44 For they all threw in of their abundance; but she out of her penury threw in all that she had, her whole living. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith to him, Teacher, see! what stones, and what buildings! 
\v 2 And Jesus said to him, Seest thou these great buildings? There will not be left one stone upon another, that will not be thrown down. 
\v 3 And as he was sitting on the Mount of Olives, over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately, 
\v 4 Tell us, when will these things be? and what will be the sign when all these things are about to be accomplished? 
\v 5 And Jesus began to say to them, See that no one deceive you. 
\v 6 Many will come in my name, saying, I am He; and will deceive many. 
\v 7 And when ye hear of wars, and rumors of wars, be not troubled; they must come to pass; but not yet is the end. 
\v 8 For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there will be earthquakes in divers places; there will be famines. These things are the beginning of travail-pains. 
\v 9 But do ye take heed to yourselves; they will deliver you up to councils, and ye will be taken into synagogues and beaten; and ye will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them. 
\v 10 And the glad tidings must first be published to all the nations. 
\v 11 And when they lead you away to deliver you up, be not anxious beforehand as to what ye shall speak; but whatever shall be given you in that hour, that speak; for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Spirit. 
\v 12 And brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child; and children will rise up against parents, and put them to death. 
\v 13 And ye will be hated by all on account of my name. But he that endureth to the end will be saved. 
\v 14 But when ye see the abomination of desolation standing where it ought not,—let him that readeth understand,—then let those who are in Judaea flee to the mountains; 
\v 15 let not him that is on the house-top go down, nor enter, to take anything out of his house; 
\v 16 and let not him that is in the field turn back to take his garment. 
\v 17 And woe to the women with child, and to those with children at the breast, in those days! 
\v 18 And pray that it may not be in winter. 
\v 19 For those days will be a time of distress, such as hath not been from the beginning of the creation which God created until now, nor shall be. 
\v 20 And if the Lord had not shortened the days, no flesh would have been saved; but for the sake of the chosen whom he chose, he shortened the days. 
\v 21 And then if any one shall say to you, See! here is the Christ; see! there; believe him not. 
\v 22 For false Christs and false prophets will rise up, and will do signs and wonders, to lead astray, if possible, the chosen. 
\v 23 But do ye take heed! I have told you all beforehand. 
\v 24 But in those days, after that distress, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give her light; 
\v 25 and the stars will be falling from heaven, and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken. 
\v 26 And then will they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory. 
\v 27 And then will he send forth the angels, and will gather the chosen ones from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven. 
\v 28 And from the fig-tree learn its parable. When its branch hath now become tender, and putteth forth its leaves, ye know that summer is near. 
\v 29 So also, when ye see these things coming to pass, know ye that he is near, at the doors. 
\v 30 Truly do I say to you, that this generation will not pass away, till all these things take place. 
\v 31 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away. 
\v 32 But that day or hour knoweth no one, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father. 
\v 33 Take heed, watch; for ye know not when the time is. 
\v 34 As a man going abroad, having left his house and given authority to his servants, to each one his work, also commanded the porter to watch, 
\v 35 so also watch ye; for ye know not when the master of the house is coming, whether at evening, or at midnight, or at the cock-crowing, or in the morning; 
\v 36 lest coming suddenly, he find you sleeping. 
\v 37 And what I say to you, I say to all: Watch. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1 And two days after was the passover, and the feast of unleavened bread; and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might seize him by craft, and put him to death. 
\v 2 For they said, Not at the feast, lest there be an uproar among the people. 
\v 3 And when he was at Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, as he was reclining at table, there came a woman having an alabaster bottle of ointment of pure spikenard, very precious; and breaking the bottle, she poured it on his head. 
\v 4 And there were some that were much displeased, [[and said]] among themselves, Why is this waste of the ointment made? 
\v 5 For this ointment might have been sold for more than three hundred denaries, and given to the poor. And they chid her harshly. 
\v 6 But Jesus said, Let her alone; why do ye trouble her? A good deed hath she done for me. 
\v 7 For the poor ye have always with you, and whenever ye will, ye can do good to them; but me ye have not always. 
\v 8 She hath done what she could; she hath anointed my body beforehand for its burial. 
\v 9 And truly do I say to you, Wherever the glad tidings shall be published throughout the whole world, this too which she hath done will be told for a memorial of her. 
\v 10 And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests, that he might deliver him up to them. 
\v 11 And they when they heard it were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought a good opportunity to deliver him up. 
\v 12 And on the first day of the feast of unleavened bread, when they used to kill the passover, his disciples say to him, Where wilt thou that we go and make ready for thee to eat the passover? 
\v 13 And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith to them, Go into the city, and there will meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water; follow him; 
\v 14 and wherever he goeth in, say to the master of the house, The Teacher saith, Where is my guest-chamber, where I may eat the passover with my disciples? 
\v 15 And he will show you a large upper room furnished and prepared; and there make ready for us. 
\v 16 And the disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had told them; and they made ready the passover. 
\v 17 And when it was evening, he cometh with the twelve. 
\v 18 And as they were reclining at table and eating, Jesus said, Truly do I say to you, that one of you will betray me,—one that is eating with me. 
\v 19 They began to be sorrowful, and to say to him one by one, Is it I? 
\v 20 And he said to them, It is one of the twelve, one that is dipping with me in the dish. 
\v 21 For the Son of man indeed goeth away, as it hath been written concerning him; but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! Well were it for that man if he had not been born. 
\v 22 And as they were eating, he took a loaf, and blessed, and broke it, and gave it to them, and said, Take; this is my body. 
\v 23 And he took a cup, and having given thanks, gave it to them; and they all drank of it. 
\v 24 And he said to them, This is my blood of the covenant, which is shed for many. 
\v 25 Truly do I say to you, I shall not drink hereafter of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God. 
\v 26 And having sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. 
\v 27 And Jesus saith to them, Ye will all fall away from me; for it is written, “I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.” 
\v 28 But after I have risen, I will go before you into Galilee. 
\v 29 But Peter said to him, Even if all shall fall away, yet will not I. 
\v 30 And Jesus saith to him, Truly do I say to thee, that even thou, to-day, on this night, before a cock crow twice, wilt thrice deny me. 
\v 31 But he spoke the more vehemently: If I must die with thee, I will not deny thee. And so also said they all. 
\v 32 And they come to a place called Gethsemane; and he saith to his disciples, Sit here, while I pray. 
\v 33 And he taketh with him Peter and James and John; and began to be in great consternation and anguish. 
\v 34 And he saith to them, My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death; remain here and watch. 
\v 35 And going on a little farther, he fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it was possible, the hour might pass from him. 
\v 36 And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible to thee! take away this cup from me. But not what I will, but what thou wilt. 
\v 37 And he cometh and findeth them sleeping; and he saith to Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? Couldst not thou watch one hour? 
\v 38 Watch, and pray that ye enter not into temptation; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. 
\v 39 And again he went away and prayed, saying the same words. 
\v 40 And returning, he found them again sleeping, for their eyes were heavy; and they knew not what to answer him. 
\v 41 And he cometh the third time, and saith to them, Sleep on, and take your rest! It is enough! the hour is come: lo! the Son of man is delivered up into the hands of sinners. 
\v 42 Rise, let us be going; lo! he that delivereth me up is at hand. 
\v 43 And immediately, while he was yet speaking, cometh Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, and with him a multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the scribes and elders. 
\v 44 And his betrayer had given them a signal, saying, Whomever I shall kiss, he is the man; seize him, and lead him away securely. 
\v 45 And on coming he immediately went up to him, and said, Rabbi! and kissed him. 
\v 46 And they laid hands on him and seized him. 
\v 47 And one of those who stood by drew his sword, and smote the servant of the high-priest, and cut off his ear. 
\v 48 And Jesus answering said to them, Ye have come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs, to take me. 
\v 49 I was daily with you in the temple, teaching, and ye did not lay hands on me; but [[thus it is]], that the Scriptures may be fulfilled. 
\v 50 And all forsook him and fled. 
\v 51 And there followed him a certain young man having a linen cloth wrapped round his naked body; and they laid hold of him. 
\v 52 And he left the linen cloth behind, and fled naked. 
\v 53 And they led Jesus away to the high-priest; and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes come together. 
\v 54 And Peter followed him afar off, even into the court of the palace of the high-priest, and was sitting with the officers, and warming himself at the fire. 
\v 55 And the chief priests and the whole council sought for testimony against Jesus in order to put him to death; and they found none. 
\v 56 For many bore false witness against him, but their testimonies did not agree together. 
\v 57 And some stood up and bore false witness against him, saying, 
\v 58 We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another not made with hands. 
\v 59 And not even so did their testimony agree. 
\v 60 And the high-priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Dost thou make no answer to what these men testify against thee? 
\v 61 But he was silent, and answered nothing. Again the high-priest asked him, and saith to him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed? 
\v 62 And Jesus said, I am; and ye will see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven. 
\v 63 Then the high-priest rent his garments, and said, What further need have we of witnesses? 
\v 64 Ye have heard the blasphemy; what think ye? And they all condemned him as deserving the punishment of death. 
\v 65 And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face and buffet him, and say to him, Prophesy! And the officers, with blows, took him in charge. 
\v 66 And as Peter was below in the court, there cometh one of the maid-servants of the high-priest; 
\v 67 and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him and said, Thou too wast with the Nazarene, Jesus. 
\v 68 But he denied, saying, I do not know nor understand what thou sayest. And he went out into the fore-court; and a cock crew. 
\v 69 And the maid-servant, seeing him, began again to say to those who were standing by, This is one of them. 
\v 70 And he denied it again. And shortly after, those who were standing by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them; for thou art a Galilaean. 
\v 71 But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak. 
\v 72 And immediately a cock crew a second time. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus had said to him, Before a cock crows twice, thou wilt thrice deny me. And when he thought thereon, he wept. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1 And as soon as it was morning, the chief priests, having held a consultation with the elders and the scribes, and the whole council, bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him up to Pilate. 
\v 2 And Pilate asked him, Art thou the king of the Jews? And he answering saith to him, I am. 
\v 3 And the chief priests brought many charges against him. 
\v 4 And Pilate asked him again, Dost thou make no answer? See what things they are testifying against thee! 
\v 5 But Jesus made no further answer; so that Pilate marveled. 
\v 6 Now at the feast he was wont to release to them one prisoner, whom they might ask. 
\v 7 And there was one named Barabbas, who lay bound with insurgents who had committed murder in the insurrection. 
\v 8 And the multitude, coming up, began to ask him to do as he had been wont to do for them. 
\v 9 And Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release to you the king of the Jews? 
\v 10 For he knew that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up. 
\v 11 But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should rather release to them Barabbas. 
\v 12 And Pilate answering again said to them, What then would ye have me do with him whom ye call the king of the Jews? 
\v 13 And they cried out again, Crucify him! 
\v 14 Then Pilate said to them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more, Crucify him! 
\v 15 And Pilate, wishing to satisfy the multitude, released to them Barabbas; and, when he had scourged Jesus, delivered him up to be crucified. 
\v 16 And the soldiers led him away into the court, which is the Praetorium; and they call together the whole band. 
\v 17 And they clothe him with purple, and having platted a crown of thorns, they put it on him. 
\v 18 And they began to salute him: Hail, king of the Jews! 
\v 19 And they struck him on the head with a reed, and spit upon him, and kneeling down, did him homage. 
\v 20 And after they had made sport of him, they stripped him of the purple robe, and put his own garments on him. And they lead him out to crucify him. 
\v 21 And they compel one Simon a Cyrenaean, who was passing by, coming from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to carry his cross. 
\v 22 And they bring him to the place Golgotha; which is, when interpreted, Place of a Skull. 
\v 23 And they gave him wine mingled with myrrh; but he did not take it. 
\v 24 And they crucify him, and divide his garments, casting lots for them, what each should take. 
\v 25 And it was the third hour when they crucified him. 
\v 26 And on the cross the inscription of the charge against him was written: “The king of the Jews.” 
\v 27 And with him they crucify two robbers; one on his right hand, and one on his left. 
\v 28  
\v 29 And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ha! thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it up in three days, 
\v 30 save thyself, and come down from the cross. 
\v 31 In like manner also the chief priests, with the scribes, making sport among themselves, said, He saved others, cannot he save himself? 
\v 32 Let the Christ, the king of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him were reviling him. 
\v 33 And when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. 
\v 34 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani? which is, when interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? 
\v 35 And some of those who stood by, when they heard it, said, See! he is calling for Elijah. 
\v 36 And one ran and filled a sponge with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink, saying, Hold! Let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down. 
\v 37 And Jesus, having uttered a loud cry, expired. 
\v 38 And the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom. 
\v 39 And the centurion who stood over against him, seeing that he so expired, said, Truly this man was the Son of God. 
\v 40 There were also women looking on from a distance; among whom was Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome; 
\v 41 who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and rendered him their services; and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem. 
\v 42 And evening having now come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath, 
\v 43 Joseph of Arimathaea, an honorable councilor, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, came, and boldly went in to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. 
\v 44 And Pilate wondered that he was already dead; and calling to him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been long dead. 
\v 45 And having been informed by the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph. 
\v 46 And having bought fine linen, he took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a tomb which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone to the door of the tomb. 
\v 47 And Mary the Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid. 
\c 16  
\p
\v 1 And when the sabbath was past, Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought spices, that they might come and anoint him. 
\v 2 And very early on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb at the rising of the sun. 
\v 3 And they said to one another, Who will roll away for us the stone from the door of the tomb? 
\v 4 And looking up they see that the stone had been rolled back; for it was very large. 
\v 5 And they entered the tomb, and saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted. 
\v 6 But he saith to them, Be not affrighted; ye seek Jesus the Nazarene who was crucified; he hath risen; he is not here; behold the place where they laid him. 
\v 7 But go, tell his disciples and Peter, that he is going before you into Galilee; there ye will see him, as he said to you. 
\v 8 And they went out, and fled from the tomb; for trembling and amazement had seized them, and they said nothing to any one; for they were terrified. 
\v 9 {The remaining twelve verses, according to Tischendorf and others, made originally no part of Mark's Gospel. As the passage was added very early, however, since it is referred to by Irenaeus in the latter part of the second century, it is here given, as an appendix.} [[And having risen early, on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary the Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven demons. 
\v 10 She went and reported it to those who had been with him, who were mourning and weeping. 
\v 11 And they, when they heard that he was alive, and had been seen by her, did not believe. 
\v 12 After this, he manifested himself in another form to two of them as they walked, going into the country. 
\v 13 And they went and reported it to the rest; and even them they did not believe. 
\v 14 Afterward he manifested himself to the eleven themselves, as they were reclining at table, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who had seen him after he had risen. 
\v 15 And he said to them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the glad tidings to the whole creation. 
\v 16 He that believeth and is baptized will be saved; but he that doth not believe will be condemned. 
\v 17 And these signs will accompany believers: In my name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new tongues; 
\v 18 they will take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover. 
\v 19 So then, the Lord, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sat down on the right hand of God; 
\v 20 and they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word by the signs which followed it.]]
