\v 1 The visions of Isaiah, the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. 
\v 2 Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth! For Jehovah speaketh: “I have nourished and brought up children, And they have rebelled against me. 
\v 3 The ox knoweth his owner, And the ass his master's crib; But Israel doth not know; My people do not consider.” 
\v 4 Ah, sinful nation! a people laden with iniquity! A race of evil-doers! degenerate children! They have forsaken Jehovah; they have despised the Holy One of Israel; They have gone backward. 
\v 5 Where can ye be smitten again, Since ye renew your rebellion? The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint; 
\v 6 From the sole of the foot even to the head, there is no soundness in it; It is all bruises, and stripes, and flesh wounds, Neither pressed, nor bound up, nor softened with ointment. 
\v 7 Your country is desolate; Your cities are burnt with fire; Your ground, strangers devour it before your eyes; It is become desolate, destroyed by an enemy. 
\v 8 And the daughter of Zion is left as a shed in a vineyard, As a hut in a garden of cucumbers, As a besieged city. 
\v 9 Had not Jehovah of hosts left us a small remnant, We had soon become as Sodom; We had been like to Gomorrah. 
\v 10 Hear ye the word of Jehovah, ye princes of Sodom! Give ear to the instruction of our God, ye people of Gomorrah! 
\v 11 What to me is the multitude of your sacrifices? saith Jehovah; I am satiated with burnt-offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; In the blood of bullocks and of lambs and of goats I have no delight. 
\v 12 When ye come to appear before me, Who hath required this of you, to tread my courts? 
\v 13 Bring no more false oblations! Incense is an abomination to me, The new moon also, and the sabbath, and the calling of the assembly; Iniquity and festivals I cannot endure. 
\v 14 Your new moons and your feasts my soul hateth; They are a burden to me; I am weary of bearing them. 
\v 15 When ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you; Yea, when ye multiply prayers, I will not hear: Your hands are full of blood! 
\v 16 Wash you; make you clean; Put away your evil doings from before mine eyes; 
\v 17 Cease to do evil; Learn to do well; Seek justice; relieve the oppressed; Defend the fatherless; plead for the widow! 
\v 18 Come, now, and let us argue together, saith Jehovah. Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; Though they be red as crimson, they shall be like wool. 
\v 19 If ye be willing and obedient, Ye shall consume the good of the land. 
\v 20 But if ye refuse, and be rebellious, The sword shall consume you; For the mouth of Jehovah hath said it. 
\v 21 How is the faithful city become a harlot, She that was full of equity! Once justice dwelt in her, but now murderers! 
\v 22 Thy silver is become dross; Thy wine is adulterated with water. 
\v 23 Thy princes are faithless, companions of thieves; Every one of them loveth gifts, and seeketh rewards; They render not justice to the fatherless, And the cause of the widow cometh not before them. 
\v 24 Wherefore, thus saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel: Ha! I will ease me of mine adversaries, And avenge me of mine enemies. 
\v 25 And I will again turn my hand toward thee, And wholly purge away thy dross, And take away all thy alloy. 
\v 26 And I will restore thee judges, as at the first, And counsellors, as at the beginning. Then shalt thou be called the city of righteousness, the faithful city. 
\v 27 Through justice shall Zion be delivered, And her reformed sons through righteousness. 
\v 28 But destruction shall fall at once on the rebels and sinners; Yea, they that forsake Jehovah shall be consumed. 
\v 29 For ye shall be ashamed of the terebinths in which ye delighted; Ye shall blush for the gardens which ye loved; 
\v 30 And ye shall be as a terebinth-tree whose leaves are withered, And as a garden in which is no water. 
\v 31 The strong shall become tow, And his work a spark of fire; Both shall burn together, And none shall quench them. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 The word, which was revealed to Isaiah, the son of Amoz, concerning Judah and Jerusalem. 
\v 2 It shall come to pass in the last days, That the mountain of the house of Jehovah shall be established at the head of the mountains, And exalted above the hills; And all nations shall flow unto it. 
\v 3 And many kingdoms shall go, and shall say, “Come, let us go to the mountain of Jehovah, To the house of the God of Jacob, That he may teach us his ways, And that we may walk in his paths!” For from Zion shall go forth a law, And the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem. 
\v 4 He shall be a judge of the nations, And an umpire of many kingdoms; And they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, And their spears into pruning-hooks; Nation shall not lift up the sword against nation, Neither shall they learn war any more. 
\v 5 O house of Jacob, come ye, And let us walk in the light of Jehovah! 
\v 6 For thou hast forsaken thy people, the house of Jacob, Because they are full of the East, And are sorcerers, like the Philistines, And strike hands with a foreign race! 
\v 7 Their land is full of silver and gold, And there is no end to their treasures; Their land is full of horses, And there is no end to their chariots; 
\v 8 Their land is full of idols; They bow down to the work of their own hands, To that which their own fingers have made. 
\v 9 Therefore shall the mean man be bowed down, And the great man be brought low; And thou wilt not forgive them! 
\v 10 Go into the rock, hide yourselves in the dust, From the terror of Jehovah, and the glory of his majesty! 
\v 11 The proud looks of man shall be humbled, And the loftiness of mortals shall be brought low; Jehovah alone shall be exalted in that day. 
\v 12 For Jehovah of hosts holdeth a day of judgment Against all that is proud and lofty; Against all that is exalted, and it shall be brought low; 
\v 13 Against all the cedars of Lebanon, the high and the exalted, And against all the oaks of Bashan; 
\v 14 Against all the lofty mountains, And against all the high hills; 
\v 15 Against every lofty tower, And against every high wall; 
\v 16 Against all the ships of Tarshish, And against all their beautiful flags. 
\v 17 The pride of man shall be humbled; The loftiness of mortals shall be brought low; Jehovah alone shall be exalted in that day. 
\v 18 The idols shall wholly pass away; 
\v 19 And men shall go into clefts of the rocks, and caves of the earth, From the terror of Jehovah, and the glory of his majesty, When he ariseth to make the earth tremble. 
\v 20 At that time shall men cast away their idols of silver and their idols of gold, Which they have made to worship, To the moles and the bats; 
\v 21 Fleeing into caves of the rocks, and clefts of the craggy rocks, From the terror of Jehovah, and the glory of his majesty, When he ariseth to make the earth tremble. 
\v 22 Trust, then, no more in man, Whose breath is in his nostrils! For what account is to be made of him! 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 For behold, the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, Taketh away from Jerusalem and from Judah every stay and support; The whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water; 
\v 2 The mighty man, and the warrior, The judge, the prophet, the diviner, and the sage, 
\v 3 The captain of fifty, and the honorable man, The counsellor, the expert in arts, and the skilful in charms. 
\v 4 And I will make boys their princes, And children shall rule over them. 
\v 5 And the people shall oppress one another, Man striving against man, and neighbor against neighbor; The boy shall behave himself insolently toward the aged, And the base toward the honorable. 
\v 6 Then shall a man take hold of his brother in his father's house, [[and say,]] Thou hast yet clothing, Be thou our ruler, And take this ruin into thy hands! 
\v 7 But in that day shall he lift up his hand, and say: I am no healer; In my house is neither bread nor raiment; Make not me ruler of the people! 
\v 8 For Jerusalem tottereth, and Judah falleth, Because their tongues and their deeds are against Jehovah, To provoke his holy eyes. 
\v 9 Their very countenance witnesseth against them; They publish their sin like Sodom; they hide it not; Woe to them, for they bring evil upon themselves! 
\v 10 Say ye of the righteous that it shall be well with him, For he shall eat the fruit of his doings. 
\v 11 Woe to the wicked, it shall be ill with him, For the work of his hands shall be repaid him! 
\v 12 As for my people, children are their oppressors, And women rule over them. O my people, thy leaders cause thee to err, And destroy the way in which thou walkest! 
\v 13 Jehovah standeth up to maintain his cause; He standeth up to judge his people. 
\v 14 Jehovah entereth into judgment with the elders of his people, and their princes: “So then ye have consumed the vineyard; The plunder of the poor is in your houses! 
\v 15 What mean ye, that ye crush my people, And grind the faces of the poor?” Saith Jehovah, the Lord of hosts. 
\v 16 Thus, also, saith Jehovah: Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, And walk with outstretched necks, And glance their eyes wantonly, Mincing their steps as they go, And tinkling with their foot-clasps, 
\v 17 Therefore will the Lord make their heads bald, And Jehovah will expose their nakedness. 
\v 18 In that day shall the Lord take from them The ornaments of the foot-clasps, and the net-works, and the crescents; 
\v 19 The ear-rings, and the bracelets, and the veils; 
\v 20 The turbans, and the ankle-chains, and the belts; The perfume-boxes, and the amulets; 
\v 21 The finger-rings, and the nose-jewels; 
\v 22 The embroidered robes, and the tunics, and the cloaks, and the purses; 
\v 23 The mirrors, and the linen shifts, and the head-bands, and the large veils. 
\v 24 And instead of perfume there shall be corruption; Instead of a belt, a rope; Instead of curled locks, baldness; Instead of a wide mantle, a covering of sackcloth; Fire-scars instead of beauty. 
\v 25 Thy men shall fall by the sword, Yea, thy mighty men in battle; 
\v 26 Her gates shall lament and mourn, And she, being desolate, shall sit upon the ground. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 In that day shall seven women lay hold of one man saying: We will eat our own bread, And wear our own garments, Only let us be called by thy name, And take away our reproach! 
\v 2 In that day shall the increase of Jehovah be glorious and honorable, And the fruit of the land excellent and beautiful, For them that have escaped of Israel. 
\v 3 All that remain in Zion, And all that are left in Jerusalem, Shall be called holy; Every one that is written down for life in Jerusalem. 
\v 4 When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, And have removed the blood of Jerusalem from the midst of her, By a spirit of judgment and a spirit of destruction, 
\v 5 Then shall Jehovah create upon the whole extent of mount Zion, and upon her places of assembly, A cloud and smoke by day, And the brightness of a flaming fire by night; Yea, for all that is glorious there shall be a shelter; 
\v 6 There shall be a tent by day for a shadow from the heat, And for a refuge and shelter from the storm and rain. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 Let me sing now a song respecting my friend, A song respecting my friend touching his vineyard. My friend had a vineyard On a very fruitful hill; 
\v 2 He digged it, and cleared it of stones, And planted it with the choicest vine, And built a tower in the midst of it, And hewed out a wine-press therein; Then he looked that it should bring forth its grapes, But it brought forth sour grapes. 
\v 3 And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, Judge ye between me and my vineyard! 
\v 4 What could have been done for my vineyard That I have not done for it? Why, then, when I looked that it should bring forth its grapes, Brought it forth sour grapes? 
\v 5 But come now, and I will tell you What I mean to do with my vineyard. I will take away its hedge, and it shall be eaten up; I will break down its wall, and it shall be trodden down! 
\v 6 And I will make it a waste; It shall not be pruned, nor digged, But shall grow up into thorns and briers; I will also command the clouds That they shed no rain upon it. 
\v 7 The vineyard of Jehovah of hosts is the house of Israel, And the men of Judah the plant of his delight. He looked for justice, and behold, bloodshed! For righteousness, and behold, outcry! 
\v 8 Woe to them that join house to house, That add field to field, Till there is no place left, And they dwell alone in the land. 
\v 9 To mine ear hath Jehovah of hosts revealed it: Surely many houses shall become a desolation, The great and the fair ones, without an inhabitant. 
\v 10 Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield a single bath of wine, And a homer of seed shall produce but an ephah. 
\v 11 Woe to them that rise early in the morning to follow strong drink,—Who sit late in the night that wine may inflame them! 
\v 12 And the lyre and the harp, the tabret and the pipe, and wine, are at their feasts, But they regard not the work of Jehovah, Nor attend to the operation of his hands. 
\v 13 Therefore shall my people be led captive, when they think not of it; Their honorable men shall be famished with hunger, And their rich men parched with thirst. 
\v 14 Therefore doth the under-world enlarge its greedy throat, And stretch open its mouth without measure, And down go her nobility and her wealth, Her busy throng, and all that was joyful within her. 
\v 15 The mean man shall be bowed down, And the great man shall be brought low, And the eyes of the haughty shall be humbled; 
\v 16 Jehovah of hosts shall be exalted through judgment; Yea, God, the Holy One, shall be sanctified through righteousness. 
\v 17 Then shall the lambs feed, as in their own pasture, And the deserted fields of the rich shall strangers consume. 
\v 18 Woe to them that draw calamity with cords of wickedness, And punishment as with wagon-traces,— 
\v 19 Who say, Let him make speed, let him hasten his work that we may see it! Let the purpose of the Holy One of Israel draw near and be fulfilled, that we may know it! 
\v 20 Woe to them that call evil good, and good evil, That put darkness for light, and light for darkness, That put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter! 
\v 21 Woe to them that are wise in their own eyes, And prudent in their own conceit! 
\v 22 Woe to them that are valiant to drink wine, And men of might to mingle strong drink! 
\v 23 That clear the guilty for a reward, And take away from the righteous his right! 
\v 24 Therefore, as fire devours stubble, And as the withered grass sinks into the flame, So their root shall become rottenness, And their blossom shall fly up like dust. For they have despised the law of Jehovah of hosts, And contemned the word of the Holy One of Israel. 
\v 25 Therefore is the anger of Jehovah kindled against his people; He stretcheth forth his hand against them, and smiteth them, so that the mountains tremble, And their carcasses are as dung in the midst of the streets; For all this his anger is not turned away, But his hand is stretched out still. 
\v 26 He lifteth up a banner for the nations afar off, He whistleth for them from the ends of the earth, And behold, they haste, and come swiftly. 
\v 27 None among them is weary, and none stumbleth; None slumbereth nor sleepeth; The girdle of their loins is not loosed, Nor the latchet of their shoes broken. 
\v 28 Their arrows are sharp, And all their bows bent; The hoofs of their horses are like flint, And their wheels like a whirlwind. 
\v 29 Their roaring is like the roaring of the lion; They roar like young lions; They roar, and seize the prey; They bear it away, and none can rescue it. 
\v 30 Yea, in that day shall they roar against them like the roaring of the sea; And if one look to the land, behold darkness and sorrow, And the light is darkened by its clouds.

\v 1 In the year in which King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne high and lifted up, and the train of his robe filled the temple. 
\v 2 Around him stood seraphs; each one of them had six wings; with two he covered his face, with two he covered his feet, and with two he did fly. 
\v 3 And one called to another, and said: Holy, holy, holy is Jehovah of hosts; The whole earth is full of his glory. 
\v 4 And the foundations of the thresholds were shaken with the voice of their cry. And the temple was filled with smoke. 
\v 5 Then I said, Alas for me! I am undone! For I am a man of unclean lips, and dwell among a people of unclean lips, and mine eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of hosts. 
\v 6 Then flew one of the seraphs to me, having in his hands a glowing stone, which he had taken with the tongs from the altar. 
\v 7 And he touched my mouth, and said, Behold, this toucheth thy lips, and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin is expiated. 
\v 8 And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? And I said: Behold, here am I; send me! 
\v 9 And he said: Go, and say thou to this people, Hear ye, indeed, but understand not; See ye, indeed, but perceive not! 
\v 10 Make the heart of this people gross; Make their ears dull, and blind their eyes; That they may not see with their eyes, nor hear with their ears, Nor perceive with their hearts, and turn, and be healed. 
\v 11 Then said I, How long, Lord? He said: Until the cities be laid waste, so that there be no inhabitant, And the houses, so that there be no man, And the land be left utterly desolate; 
\v 12 Until Jehovah have removed the men far away, And there be great desolation in the land. 
\v 13 And though there be a tenth part remaining in it, Even this shall again be destroyed; Yet as when the terebinth and the oak are cut down, Their stem remaineth alive, So shall a holy race be the stem of the nation. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1 In the time of Ahaz, the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, Rezin, king of Syria, and Pekah, the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, came up against Jerusalem to besiege it; but he could not prevail against it. 
\v 2 And when it was told the house of David, that the Syrians had encamped in Ephraim, his heart was moved, and the hearts of his people, as the trees of the forest are moved with the wind. 
\v 3 Then said Jehovah to Isaiah, Go forth to meet Ahaz, thou and Shear-Jashub thy son, at the end of the aqueduct of the upper pool, in the way to the fuller's field; 
\v 4 and say to him: Take heed, and be quiet! Fear not, neither let thy heart he faint On account of the two tails of these smoking firebrands, On account of the fierce wrath of Rezin with the Syrians, and of the son of Remaliah, 
\v 5 Because Syria deviseth evil against thee, Ephraim and the son of Remaliah, saying, 
\v 6 “Let us go up against Judah, and besiege the city, And take it, And set a king in the midst of it, Even the son of Tabeal.” 
\v 7 Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: “It shall not stand, neither shall it be; 
\v 8 But the head of Syria shall still be Damascus, And the head of Damascus, Rezin; [[And within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken, that he be no more a people.]] 
\v 9 And the head of Ephraim shall still be Samaria, And the head of Samaria, the son of Remaliah. If ye will not believe, neither shall ye thrive.” 
\v 10 Jehovah spake also again to Ahaz: 
\v 11 “Ask thee a sign of Jehovah, thy God; Ask it from below, or in the height above!” 
\v 12 And Ahaz said, I will not ask; I will not tempt Jehovah! 
\v 13 Then he said, Hear ye now, O house of David! Is it too small a thing for you to weary men, That ye should weary my God also? 
\v 14 Therefore shall Jehovah himself give you a sign: Behold, the damsel shall conceive, and bear a son, And she shall call his name Immanuel. 
\v 15 Milk and honey shall he eat, Until he learn to refuse the evil, and choose the good; 
\v 16 For before this child shall have learned to refuse the evil and choose the good, The land shall become desolate, On account of whose two kings thou art in terror. 
\v 17 Yet Jehovah shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy father's house, Days such as have not been Since Ephraim revolted from Judah. [[Even the king of Assyria.]] 
\v 18 And it shall come to pass in that day That Jehovah shall whistle for the fly that is at the end of the streams of Egypt, And the bee that is in the land of Assyria, 
\v 19 And they shall come, and light all of them In the desolate valleys, and fissures of the rocks, And upon all hedges, and upon all pastures. 
\v 20 In that day shall Jehovah shave, with a razor hired beyond the river, [[with the king of Assyria,]] The head, and the hair of the feet; Yea, even the beard shall he take away. 
\v 21 And it shall come to pass in that day, That a man shall keep a young cow, and two sheep; 
\v 22 And for the abundance of milk which they produce, shall he eat cheese; For milk and honey shall all eat Who are left in the land, 
\v 23 And it shall come to pass in that day, That every place where stood a thousand vines, worth a thousand shekels of silver, Shall be covered with briers and thorns. 
\v 24 With arrows and with bows shall men go thither; For all the land shall become briers and thorns. 
\v 25 All the hills that were digged with the mattock Shall no one approach through fear of briers and thorns; They shall be for the pasturage of oxen, And the trampling of sheep. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1 And Jehovah said to me, Take thee a great tablet, and with a man's writing-instrument write on it, Hasteth-the-prey, Speedeth-the-spoil. 
\v 2 And I took with me faithful witnesses, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah, the son of Berechiah. 
\v 3 I went in to the prophetess, and she conceived and bore a son. Then said Jehovah to me, Call his name, Hasteth-the-prey, Speedeth-the-spoil. 
\v 4 For before the child shall learn to say, My father, and My mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be borne away before the king of Assyria. 
\v 5 Moreover, Jehovah spake to me again, saying: 
\v 6 Because this people despiseth The soft-flowing waters of Siloah, And rejoiceth in Rezin, and the son of Remaliah, 
\v 7 Therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth upon them the strong and mighty waters of the river; [[The king of Assyria and all his glory.]] He shall rise above all his channels, And go over all his banks. 
\v 8 And he shall pass through Judah, overflowing and spreading; Even to the neck shall he reach, And his stretched-out wings shall fill the whole breadth of thy land, O Immanuel! 
\v 9 Rage, ye nations, and despair! Give ear, all ye distant parts of the earth! Gird yourselves, and despair! Gird yourselves, and despair! 
\v 10 Form your plan, and it shall come to naught; Give the command, and it shall not stand; For God is with us. 
\v 11 For thus spake Jehovah to me with a strong hand, Instructing me not to walk in the way of this people: 
\v 12 Call not everything a confederacy which this people calleth a confederacy; Fear ye not what they fear, Neither be afraid! 
\v 13 Jehovah of hosts, sanctify ye him; Let him be your fear, and let him be your dread! 
\v 14 And he shall be to you a sanctuary; But a stone of stumbling, and a rock to strike against, To the two houses of Israel, A trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
\v 15 And many among them shall stumble; They shall fall, and be broken; They shall be ensnared and taken. 
\v 16 Bind up the revelation, Seal the word, with my disciples! 
\v 17 I will, therefore, wait for Jehovah, Who now hideth his face from the house of Jacob; Yet will I look for him. 
\v 18 Behold, I, and the children which Jehovah hath given me, Are signs and tokens in Israel From Jehovah of hosts, who dwelleth upon mount Zion. 
\v 19 And when they shall say to you, “Inquire of the necromancers and the wizards, That chirp, and that murmur,” [[Then say ye,]] “Should not a people inquire of their God? Should they inquire of the dead for the living?” 
\v 20 To the word, to the revelation! If they speak not according to this, For them no bright morning shall arise. 
\v 21 They shall pass through the land distressed and famished; And when they are famished, they shall be enraged, and curse their king and their God, And look upward. 
\v 22 And if they look to the earth, Behold distress and darkness, fearful darkness! And into darkness shall they be driven. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 But the darkness shall not remain where now is distress; Of old he brought the land of Zebulon and the land of Naphtali into contempt; In future times shall he bring the land of the sea beyond Jordan, the circle of the gentiles, into honor. 
\v 2 The people that walk in darkness behold a great light; They who dwell in the land of death-like shade, Upon them a light shineth. 
\v 3 Thou enlargest the nation; Thou increasest their joy; They rejoice before thee with the joy of harvest, With the joy of those who divide the spoil. 
\v 4 For thou breakest their heavy yoke, And the rod that smote their backs, And the scourge of the taskmaster, As in the day of Midian. 
\v 5 For every greave of the warrior in battle, And the war-garment rolled in blood, Shall be burned; yea, it shall be food for the fire. 
\v 6 For to us a child is born, To us a son is given, And the government shall be upon his shoulder, And he shall be called Wonderful, counsellor, mighty potentate, Everlasting father, prince of peace; 
\v 7 His dominion shall be great, And peace without end shall be upon the throne of David and his kingdom, To fix and establish it Through justice and equity, Henceforth and forever. The zeal of Jehovah of hosts will do this. 
\v 8 The Lord sendeth a word against Jacob; It cometh down to Israel. 
\v 9 His whole people shall feel it, Ephraim, and the inhabitants of Samaria, Who say in pride and arrogance of heart, 
\v 10 “The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones; The sycamores are cut down, but we will replace them with cedars.” 
\v 11 Jehovah will raise up the enemies of Rezin against them, And will arm their adversaries; 
\v 12 The Syrians before, the Philistines behind, Who shall devour Israel with wide jaws. For all this his anger is not turned away, But his hand is stretched out still. 
\v 13 The people turn not to him that smiteth them; Neither do they seek Jehovah of hosts. 
\v 14 Therefore shall Jehovah cut off from Israel the head and the tail, The palm-branch and the rush, in one day. 
\v 15 [[The aged and the honorable are the head, And the prophet that speaketh falsehood is the tail.]] 
\v 16 For the leaders of this people lead them astray, And they that are led by them go to destruction. 
\v 17 Therefore shall the Lord have no joy in their young men, And on their orphans and widows he shall have no compassion; For they are all profane, and evil-doers; Every mouth speaketh folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, But his hand is stretched out still. 
\v 18 For wickedness burneth like a fire, It consumeth the briers and thorns, And it kindleth the thicket of the forest, So that it goeth up in columns of smoke. 
\v 19 Through the wrath of Jehovah of hosts is the land burned, And the people are food for the fire; No one spareth another. 
\v 20 They consume on the right hand, and yet are hungry; They devour on the left, and are not satisfied; Every one devoureth the flesh of his arm. 
\v 21 Manasseh is against Ephraim, and Ephraim against Manasseh, And both together against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away, But his hand is stretched out still. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1 Woe to them that make unrighteous decrees, That write oppressive decisions, 
\v 2 To turn away the needy from judgment, And rob the poor of my people of their right; That the widows may become their prey, And that they may plunder the orphans. 
\v 3 What will ye do in the day of visitation, And in the desolation which cometh from afar? To whom will ye flee for help, And where will ye leave your glory? 
\v 4 Forsaken by me, they shall sink down among the prisoners, And fall among the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, But his hand is stretched out still. 
\v 5 Woe to the Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, The staff in whose hands is the instrument of my indignation! 
\v 6 Against an impious nation I will send him, And against a people under my wrath I will give him a charge To gather the spoil, and seize the prey, And to trample them under foot like the mire of the streets. 
\v 7 But he doth not so purpose, And his heart doth not so intend; But to destroy is in his heart, And to cut off a multitude of nations. 
\v 8 For he saith, “Are not my princes altogether kings? 
\v 9 Is not Calno as Carchemish? Is not Hamath as Arpad? Is not Samaria as Damascus? 
\v 10 As my hand hath seized the kingdoms of the idols, Whose graven images were more numerous than those of Jerusalem and Samaria, 
\v 11 Behold! as I have done to Samaria and her idols, So will I do to Jerusalem and her images.” 
\v 12 But when the Lord hath accomplished his whole work upon Mount Zion and Jerusalem, Then will he punish the fruit of the proud heart of the king of Assyria, And the arrogance of his lofty eyes. 
\v 13 For he hath said: “By the strength of my hand I have done it, And by my wisdom; for I am wise; I have removed the bounds of nations, I have plundered their treasures; As a hero have I brought down them that sat upon thrones. 
\v 14 The riches of the nations hath my hand seized, as a nest; As one gathereth eggs that have been left, So have I gathered the whole world. And there was none that moved the wing, Or that opened the beak, or that chirped.” 
\v 15 Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth with it? Or shall the saw magnify itself against him that moveth it? As if the rod should wield him that lifteth it! As if the staff should lift up him that is not wood! 
\v 16 Wherefore the Lord, the Lord of hosts, shall send upon his fat ones leanness, And under his glory shall he kindle a burning, like the burning of a fire. 
\v 17 The light of Israel shall be a fire, And his Holy One a flame, Which shall burn and devour his thorns and briers in one day. 
\v 18 The glory of his forest and of his fruitful field From the spirit even to the flesh shall he consume; It shall be with them as when a sick man fainteth. 
\v 19 The remaining trees of the forest shall be few, So that a child may write them down. 
\v 20 In that day shall the remnant of Israel, and they that have escaped of the house of Jacob, no more lean upon him that smote them; They shall lean upon Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, in truth. 
\v 21 The remnant shall return, the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty Potentate; 
\v 22 For though thy people, O Israel, be as the sand of the sea, Only a remnant of them shall return. The devastation is decreed; It shall overflow with righteousness. 
\v 23 For devastation and punishment doth the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, execute in the midst of the whole land, 
\v 24 Yet thus saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts: Fear not, O my people, that dwellest in Zion, because of the Assyrian! With his rod indeed shall he smite thee, And lift up his staff against thee in the manner of Egypt; 
\v 25 But yet a very little while, and my indignation shall have past, And my anger shall destroy them. 
\v 26 Jehovah of hosts shall raise up against him a scourge, As he smote Midian at the rock of Horeb, And as he lifted up the rod against the sea; Yea, he shall lift it up, as in Egypt. 
\v 27 In that day shall his burden be removed from thy shoulder, And his yoke from thy neck; Yea, thy yoke shall be broken, as that of a fat steer. 
\v 28 He is come to Aiath; he passeth through Migron; In Michmash he leaveth his baggage; 
\v 29 They pass the strait; At Geba they make their night-quarters; Ramah trembleth; Gibeah of Saul fleeth. 
\v 30 Cry aloud, O daughter of Gallim! Hear, O Laish! Alas, poor Anathoth! 
\v 31 Madmenah hasteth away; The inhabitants of Gebim take to flight. 
\v 32 Yet one day shall he rest at Nob, Then shall he shake his hand against the mount of the daughter of Zion, The hill of Jerusalem. 
\v 33 But behold! the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, shall lop the branches with fearful force, And the high of stature shall be cut down, And the lofty shall be brought low. 
\v 34 He shall hew the thickets of the forest with iron, And Lebanon shall fall by a mighty hand. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 Then shall spring forth a shoot from the stem of Jesse, And a sprout grow up from his roots. 
\v 2 The spirit of Jehovah shall rest upon him, The spirit of wisdom and understanding, The spirit of counsel and might, The spirit of the knowledge and of the fear of Jehovah, 
\v 3 He shall take delight in the fear of Jehovah; He shall not judge by the sight of his eyes, Nor decide by the hearing of his ears. 
\v 4 But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, And decide with equity for the afflicted of the land; He shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth; With the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked. 
\v 5 Righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, And faithfulness the girdle of his reins. 
\v 6 Then shall the wolf dwell with the lamb, And the leopard shall lie down with the kid; The calf, and the young lion, and the fatling shall be together, And a little child shall lead them. 
\v 7 The cow and the bear shall feed together, Together shall their young lie down, And the lion shall eat straw like the ox. 
\v 8 The suckling shall play upon the hole of the asp, And the near-weaned child lay his hand on the hiding-place of the basilisk. 
\v 9 They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain; For the land shall be full of the knowledge of Jehovah, As the waters cover the depths of the sea. 
\v 10 In that day shall the shoot of Jesse stand as a banner to the nations, And to him shall the gentiles repair, And his dwelling-place shall be glorious. 
\v 11 In that day shall Jehovah the second time stretch forth his hand To recover the remnant of his people, That remaineth, from Assyria, and from Egypt, And from Pathros, and from Ethiopia, and from Elam, And from Shinar, and from Hamath, And from the islands of the sea. 
\v 12 He shall set up a banner to the nations, And gather the outcasts of Israel, And bring together the dispersed of Judah, From the four extremities of the earth. 
\v 13 Then shall the jealousy of Ephraim depart, And the enmity in Judah be at an end; Ephraim shall not be jealous of Judah, And Judah shall not contend with Ephraim. 
\v 14 But they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines at the sea; Together shall they plunder the children of the East; On Edom and Moab shall they lay their hand, And the sons of Ammon shall be subject to them. 
\v 15 Then will Jehovah utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea, And shake his hand over the river with a mighty wind, And smite it into seven streams, So that men may go over it dry-shod. 
\v 16 And it shall be a highway for the remnant of the people, Which shall remain, from Assyria, As there was to Israel, When he came up from the land of Egypt. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 In that day shalt thou say, “I will praise thee, O Jehovah, for, though thou hast been angry with me, Thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortest me. 
\v 2 Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and will not be afraid; For Jehovah is my glory, and my song; It is he who was my salvation.” 
\v 3 Ye shall draw waters with joy from the fountains of salvation; 
\v 4 And in that day ye shall say, “Give thanks to Jehovah; call upon his name; Make known his deeds among the people; Give praises, for his name is exalted! 
\v 5 Sing to Jehovah, for he hath done glorious things; Be this known in all the earth! 
\v 6 Cry aloud, shout for joy, O inhabitant of Zion, For great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee!” 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 A prophecy concerning Babylon, which Isaiah, the son of Amoz, saw. 
\v 2 Upon the bare mountain lift up a banner; Cry aloud to them, wave the hand, That they may enter the gates of the tyrants! 
\v 3 I have given orders to my consecrated ones, Yea, I have called upon my mighty ones to execute mine anger, My proud exulters! 
\v 4 The noise of a multitude upon the mountains, like that of a great people! The tumultuous noise of kingdoms, of nations gathered together! Jehovah of hosts mustereth his army for battle. 
\v 5 They come from a distant country, From the end of Heaven, Jehovah and the instruments of his indignation. To lay waste the whole land. 
\v 6 Howl ye, for the day of Jehovah is at hand! Like a destruction from the Almighty, it cometh; 
\v 7 Therefore shall all hands hang down, And every heart of man shall melt. 
\v 8 They shall be in consternation; Distress and anguish shall lay hold of them; As a woman in travail shall they writhe; They shall look upon one another with amazement: Their faces shall glow like flames. 
\v 9 Behold! the day of Jehovah cometh, Terrible, full of wrath and burning indignation, To make the land a waste, And to destroy the sinners out of it. 
\v 10 For the stars of heaven, and the constellations thereof, Shall not give their light; The sun shall be darkened at his going forth, And the moon shall withhold her light. 
\v 11 For I will punish the world for its guilt, And the wicked for their iniquity. I will put an end to the arrogance of the proud, And I will bring down the haughtiness of the tyrants. 
\v 12 I will make men scarcer than gold; Yea, men than the gold of Ophir. 
\v 13 Therefore I will make the heavens tremble, And the earth shall be shaken out of her place, In the anger of Jehovah of hosts, In the day of his burning indignation. 
\v 14 Then shall they be like a chased doe; Like a flock, which no one gathereth together; Every one shall turn to his own people, And every one flee to his own land. 
\v 15 Every one that is overtaken shall be thrust through, And every one that is caught shall fall by the sword. 
\v 16 Their children shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes; Their houses shall be plundered, and their wives ravished. 
\v 17 Behold, I stir up against them the Medes, Who make no account of silver, And as to gold, they do not regard it. 
\v 18 Their bows shall strike down the young men, And on the fruit of the womb they shall have no compassion; Their eye shall not pity the children. 
\v 19 So shall Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, The proud ornament of the Chaldeans, Be like Sodom and Gomorrah, which God overthrew, 
\v 20 It shall never more be inhabited; Nor shall it be dwelt in through all generations. Nor shall the Arabian pitch his tent there, Nor shall shepherds make their folds there. 
\v 21 But there shall the wild beasts of the desert lodge, And owls shall fill their houses; And ostriches shall dwell there, And satyrs shall dance there. 
\v 22 Wolves shall howl in their palaces, And jackals in their pleasant edifices. Her time is near, And her days shall not be prolonged. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1 For Jehovah will have compassion upon Jacob, And will again set his love upon Israel, And cause them to rest in his own land. And strangers shall join themselves to them, And cleave to the house of Jacob. 
\v 2 The nations shall take them and bring them to their own place; And the house of Israel shall possess them, in the land of Jehovah, As servants and as handmaids; They shall take captive their captors, And they shall rule over their oppressors. 
\v 3 So when Jehovah shall have given thee rest From thy sorrow and thy distress, And from the hard bondage Which was laid upon thee, 
\v 4 Then shall thou utter this song over the king of Babylon, and say, “How hath the tyrant fallen, The oppression ceased! 
\v 5 Jehovah hath broken the staff of the wicked, The rod of the tyrants, 
\v 6 That smote the people in anger, With a continual stroke, That lorded it over the nations in wrath With unremitted oppression. 
\v 7 The whole earth is at rest, is quiet; They break forth into singing. 
\v 8 Even the cypress-trees exult over thee, And the cedars of Lebanon: 'Since thou art fallen, No feller cometh up against us.' 
\v 9 The under-world is in commotion on account of thee, To meet thee at thy coming; It stirreth up before thee the shades, all the mighty of the earth; It arouseth from their thrones all the kings of the nations; 
\v 10 They all accost thee, and say, 'Art thou, too, become weak as we? Art thou become like us?' 
\v 11 Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, And the sound of thy harps. Vermin have become thy couch, And worms thy covering. 
\v 12 How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! How art thou cast down to the ground, Thou that didst trample upon the nations! 
\v 13 Thou saidst in thy heart, 'I will ascend to heaven, Above the stars of God will I exalt my throne; I will sit upon the mount of assembly in the recesses of the north. 
\v 14 I will ascend above the height of the clouds; I will be like the Most High.' 
\v 15 But thou art brought down to the grave, To the depths of the pit. 
\v 16 They that see thee gaze upon thee, and view thee attentively, (and say,) 'Is this the man that made the earth tremble, That shook kingdoms, 
\v 17 That made the world a wilderness, And laid waste its cities, And sent not his captives to their homes?' 
\v 18 All the kings of the nations, yea, all of them, Lie down in glory, each in his own sepulchre; 
\v 19 But thou art cast forth without a grave, Like a worthless branch; Covered with the slain, who are pierced by the sword, Who go down to the stones of the pit, Like a carcass trampled under foot. 
\v 20 Thou shalt not be joined with them in the grave, Because thou hast destroyed thy country, And slain thy people; The race of evil-doers shall nevermore be named. 
\v 21 Prepare ye slaughter for his children, For the iniquity of their fathers, That they may no more arise, and possess the earth, And fill the world with enemies!” 
\v 22 For I will arise against them, saith Jehovah of hosts, And I will cut off from Babylon the name and remnant, Posterity and offspring, saith Jehovah. 
\v 23 I will make her the possession of the porcupine, and pools of water; Yea, I will sweep her away with the besom of destruction, saith Jehovah of hosts. 
\v 24 Jehovah of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely, as I have devised, so shall it come to pass, The purpose which I have formed, that shall stand, 
\v 25 To crush the Assyrian in my land, And to trample him on my mountains. Then shall his yoke depart from them, And his burden be removed from their shoulders. 
\v 26 This is the purpose which is formed concerning all the earth, And this the hand which is stretched out over all the nations. 
\v 27 For Jehovah of hosts hath decreed, and who shall disannul it? And his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back? 
\v 28 In the year in which Ahaz the king died came this prophecy. 
\v 29 Rejoice not, all Philistia, Because the rod that smote thee is broken, For from the root of a serpent shall come forth a basilisk, And his fruit shall be a flying, fiery serpent. 
\v 30 Then shall the most wretched of the poor feed quietly, And the needy shall lie down in security; For I will kill thy root with famine, And thy remnant shall be slain. 
\v 31 Howl, O gate! cry aloud, O city! O Philistia, thou meltest away in terror! For from the north cometh a smoke, And there is no straggler in their hosts. 
\v 32 What answer shall be given to the messengers of the nations? That Jehovah hath founded Zion, And in her shall the poor of his people find refuge. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1 The prophecy concerning Moab. Yea! in the night of assault was Ar of Moab a ruin! In the night of assault was Kir of Moab a ruin! 
\v 2 They go up to the temple, and to Dibon, to weep upon the high places; Upon Nebo and upon Medeba doth Moab howl; On every head is baldness, And every beard is shorn. 
\v 3 In their streets they gird themselves with sackcloth; On the tops of their houses and in their public walks every one howleth, And melteth away with weeping. 
\v 4 Heshbon and Elealah utter a cry; Even to Jahaz is their voice heard; Therefore the warriors of Moab shriek aloud; Their hearts tremble within them. 
\v 5 My heart crieth out for Moab, Whose fugitives wander to Zoar, to Eglath-shelishijah; For they ascend the heights of Luhith weeping, And in the way of Horonaim they raise the cry of destruction. 
\v 6 For the waters of Nimrim are desolate; The grass is withered; the tender plant faileth; There is no green thing left. 
\v 7 Wherefore the remnant of their substance and their wealth They shall carry to the brook of willows. 
\v 8 For the cry encompasseth the borders of Moab; Even to Eglaim reacheth her wailing, To Beer-Elim her howling. 
\v 9 For the waters of Dimon are full of blood; For I bring new evils upon Dimon; Upon him that escapeth of Moab will I send a lion, Even upon him that remaineth in the land. 
\c 16  
\p
\v 1 Send ye the lambs to the ruler of the land, From Selah through the wilderness To the mount of the daughter of Zion! 
\v 2 For as a wandering bird, As a forthdriven nest, So shall be the daughters of Moab At the fords of Arnon; [[saying,]] 
\v 3 “Offer counsel; give decision, Make thy shadow at noonday like the darkness of night. Hide the outcasts; Betray not the fugitives. 
\v 4 Let my outcasts dwell with thee, [[O Zion!]] Be thou to them a covert from the spoiler! For the extortion is at an end, The spoiling ceaseth. The oppressors are consumed from the land. 
\v 5 Then shall your throne be established through mercy, And upon it shall sit in the house of David A judge searching for justice, and prompt in equity.” 
\v 6 “We have beard of the pride of Moab; he is very proud; His haughtiness, and his pride, and his insolence, His vain boastings.” 
\v 7 Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab; Every one shall howl; For the ruins of Kir-hares shall ye mourn, In deep affliction. 
\v 8 For the fields of Heshbon languish, The lords of the nations break down the choicest shoots of the vine of Sibmah, They reached even to Jazer; they wandered into the desert; Her branches were spread out; they crossed the sea. 
\v 9 Therefore I will weep, like Jazer, for the vine of Sibmah; I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon and Elealah, For upon thy summer fruits, and thy harvest, the war-shout is fallen. 
\v 10 Gladness and joy are driven from the fruitful field, And in the vineyards is no singing nor shouting; The treaders tread out no wine in their vats; I have made the vintage-shouting to cease. 
\v 11 Therefore shall my bowels sound like a harp for Moab, And my inward parts for Kir-hares. 
\v 12 And it shall come to pass that though Moab present himself, Though he weary himself upon his high places, And go up to his sanctuary to pray, Yet shall he not prevail. 
\v 13 This is the word which Jehovah spake concerning Moab of old. 
\v 14 But now saith Jehovah: Within three years, like the years of a hireling, The glory of Moab shall be put to shame, With all his great multitude; And the remnant shall be very small, and without strength. 
\c 17  
\p
\v 1 The prophecy concerning Damascus. Behold, Damascus shall be no more a city; It shall become a heap of ruins. 
\v 2 The cities of Aroer shall be forsaken; They shall be pastures for flocks, Which shall lie down, and none shall make them afraid. 
\v 3 The fortress shall cease from Ephraim, And the kingdom from Damascus, and the rest of Syria; It shall be with them as with the glory of the children of Israel, Saith Jehovah of hosts. 
\v 4 In that day shall the glory of Jacob sink away, And the fatness of his flesh become leanness. 
\v 5 And it shall be as when the harvest-man gathereth the corn, And reapeth the ears with his arm; Yea, as when one gleaneth ears in the valley of Rephaim. 
\v 6 There shall be left in it only a gleaning, as in the olive-harvest, Two or three berries on the top of the highest bough, Four or five on the fruitful branches, Saith Jehovah, the God of Israel. 
\v 7 In that day shall a man have regard to his Maker, And his eyes shall look to the Holy One of Israel. 
\v 8 He shall not look to the altars, the work of his hands, Nor have respect to that which his fingers have made, The images of Astarte and the Sun-pillars. 
\v 9 In that day shall his fortified cities be like ruins in the forests, or on the mountain tops, Which the enemy left, in flight from the children of Israel; And the land shall be a desolation. 
\v 10 For thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation, And hast not been mindful of the rock of thy strength; Therefore though thou plant beautiful plants, And set shoots from a foreign soil, 
\v 11 When thou hast planted them, though thou hedge them in, And in the morning bring thy plants to the blossom, Yet shall the harvest flee away, In the day of pain and desperate sorrow. 
\v 12 Alas! a tumult of many nations! They rage with the raging of the sea. Alas! a roaring of kingdoms! They roar with the roaring of mighty waters. 
\v 13 Like the roaring of mighty waters do the nations roar; He rebuketh them, and they flee away, Driven like the chaff of the mountains before the wind, Like stubble before the whirlwind. 
\v 14 At the time of evening, behold, terror! Before morning, behold, they are no more! This is the portion of them that spoil us, And the lot of them that plunder us. 
\c 18  
\p
\v 1 Ho! thou land of rustling wings, Beyond the rivers of Ethiopia! 
\v 2 That sendest thy messengers upon the sea, In reed-boats upon the face of the waters: Go, ye swift messengers, to a nation tall and fair, To a people terrible from the first and onward, To a mighty, victorious people, Whose land is divided by rivers! 
\v 3 All ye inhabitants of the world, ye that dwell on the earth, When the standard is lifted up on the mountains, behold! When the trumpet is sounded, hear! 
\v 4 For thus hath Jehovah said to me: “I will sit still, and look on from my dwelling-place, Like a serene heat when the sun shineth, Like a dewy cloud in the heat of harvest.” 
\v 5 But before the vintage, when the bud is gone, And the blossom is ripening into a swelling grape, He shall cut off the shoots with pruning-hooks, And the branches he shall take away and cut down. 
\v 6 They shall be left together to the ravenous birds of the mountains, And to the wild beasts of the earth. The ravenous birds shall summer upon it, And every wild beast of the earth shall winter upon it. 
\v 7 At that time shall gifts be brought to Jehovah of hosts From a nation tall and fair, From a people terrible from the first and onward, A mighty, victorious people, Whose land is divided by rivers, To the dwelling-place of Jehovah of hosts, to mount Zion. 
\c 19  
\p
\v 1 The prophecy concerning Egypt. Behold, Jehovah rideth upon a swift cloud, And cometh to Egypt; The gods of Egypt tremble at his presence, And the heart of Egypt melteth within her. 
\v 2 “I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians; Brother shall fight against brother, And neighbor against neighbor; City against city, And kingdom against kingdom. 
\v 3 The spirit of Egypt shall fail within her, And her devices I will bring to naught. Then shall they consult the idols, and the sorcerers, And the necromancers, and the wizards. 
\v 4 But I will give up the Egyptians to the hands of a cruel lord, And a fierce king shall rule over them,” Saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts. 
\v 5 Then shall the waters fail from the river, Yea, the river shall be wasted and dried up. 
\v 6 The streams shall become putrid; The canals of Egypt shall be emptied and dried up; The reed and the rush shall wither. 
\v 7 The meadows by the river, by the borders of the river, And all that groweth by the river, Shall wither, be blasted, and be no more. 
\v 8 Then shall the fishermen mourn; All they that cast the hook into the river shall lament, And they that spread nets upon the face of the waters shall languish. 
\v 9 They, also, that work in flax, And they that weave white linen, shall be confounded. 
\v 10 Her pillars are broken down, And all who labor for hire are grieved in heart. 
\v 11 Surely the princes of Zoan are fools; The wise counsellors of Pharaoh have been stupid in their counsels. How, then, can ye say to Pharaoh, “I am the son of the wise, The son of ancient kings”? 
\v 12 Where are they now, thy wise men? Let them tell thee now, so that men may know it, What Jehovah of hosts hath determined concerning Egypt! 
\v 13 The princes of Zoan are become fools; The princes of Noph are deceived, Even the chiefs of her tribes have caused Egypt to err. 
\v 14 Jehovah hath mingled within her a spirit of perverseness, And they have caused Egypt to err in all her works, As a drunkard staggereth in his vomit. 
\v 15 There shall be nothing which can be done by Egypt, By the head, or the tail, the palm-branch, or the rush. 
\v 16 In that day shall the Egyptians be like women; They shall tremble and fear On account of the shaking of the hand of Jehovah of hosts, Which he shall shake against them. 
\v 17 The land of Judah shall be a terror to Egypt; Every one to whom it is mentioned shall tremble On account of the purpose of Jehovah of hosts, Which he hath determined against them. 
\v 18 In that day there shall be five cities in the land of Egypt Speaking the language of Canaan, And swearing by Jehovah of hosts; One of them shall be called the City of the Sun. 
\v 19 In that day there shall be an altar to Jehovah in the midst of the land of Egypt, And in the border of it a pillar to Jehovah, 
\v 20 Which shall be a sign and a witness For Jehovah of hosts in the land of Egypt, That they cried to Jehovah on account of their oppressors, And he sent them a saviour, and a defender, who delivered them. 
\v 21 Thus shall Jehovah be made known to Egypt, And the Egyptians shall know Jehovah in that day, And shall offer him sacrifices and oblations; They shall make vows to Jehovah, and perform them. 
\v 22 Thus Jehovah will smite Egypt; he will smite and heal her; They shall return to Jehovah; Therefore will he hear and heal them. 
\v 23 In that day shall there he a highway from Egypt to Assyria, And the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, And the Egyptian into Assyria, And the Egyptians shall worship with the Assyrians. 
\v 24 In that day shall Israel be the third In connection with Egypt and Assyria, A blessing in the midst of the earth. 
\v 25 Jehovah of hosts shall bless them, and say, Blessed be Egypt, my people, And Assyria, the work of my hands, And Israel, my inheritance! 
\c 20  
\p
\v 1 In the year in which Tartan, being sent by Sargon, the king of Assyria, came to Ashdod, and fought against Ashdod, and took it, 
\v 2 at that time spake Jehovah through Isaiah the son of Amoz in this manner: Go, and loose the sackcloth from thy loins, and put off thy shoes from thy feet. And he did so, walking naked and barefoot. 
\v 3 And Jehovah said: As my servant Isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot three years, a sign and a token for Egypt and Ethiopia, 
\v 4 so shall the king of Assyria lead the captives of Egypt, and prisoners of Ethiopia, young and old, naked and barefoot, with their hind parts uncovered, to the shame of the Egyptians. 
\v 5 Then shall they be afraid and ashamed on account of Ethiopia their trust, and of Egypt their glory. 
\v 6 The inhabitant of this coast shall say in that day, “Behold, so is it with them in whom we trusted, and to whom we fled for help, that we might be delivered from the king of Assyria. How then shall we escape?” 
\c 21  
\p
\v 1 The prophecy concerning the desert of the sea. As storms which rush along through the south, So it cometh from the desert, From the terrible land. 
\v 2 A grievous vision was revealed to me; The plunderer plundereth, and the destroyer destroyeth. “Go up, O Elam! Besiege, O Media! All sighing do I make to cease.” 
\v 3 Therefore are my loins full of pain; Pangs have seized me, as the pangs of a woman in travail; For convulsions I cannot hear; For anguish I cannot see. 
\v 4 My heart panteth, Terror hath seized upon me; The evening of my desire is changed into horror. 
\v 5 The table is prepared; the watch is set; They eat; they drink; “Arise, ye princes! Anoint the shield!” 
\v 6 For thus said the Lord unto me: “Go, set a watchman, Who shall declare what he seeth.” 
\v 7 And he saw a troop, horsemen in pairs, Riders on asses, and riders on camels, And he watched with the utmost heed. 
\v 8 Then he cried like a lion: “My Lord, I stand continually upon the watch-tower in the daytime, And keep my post all the night; 
\v 9 And behold, there cometh a troop, Horsemen in pairs.” Again also he lifted up his voice, and said: “Fallen, fallen is Babylon, And all the graven images of her gods are cast broken to the ground.” 
\v 10 O my threshing, and the corn of my floor! What I have heard from Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, That have I declared to you. 
\v 11 The prophecy concerning Dumah. A voice came to me from Seir: “Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?” 
\v 12 The watchman saith: “Morning cometh, and also night. If ye will inquire, inquire! Return, come!” 
\v 13 The prophecy against the Arabians. In the thickets of Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye caravans of Dedan! 
\v 14 The inhabitants of the land of Tema Bring water to the thirsty; They come to meet the fugitive with bread. 
\v 15 For they flee from swords, From the drawn sword, And from the bent bow, And from the fury of war. 
\v 16 For thus saith the Lord to me: Within one year, according to the years of a hireling, Shall all the glory of Kedar be consumed. 
\v 17 The remainder of the mighty bowmen of the sons of Kedar shall be diminished; For Jehovah, the God of Israel, hath said it. 
\c 22  
\p
\v 1 The prophecy concerning the valley of vision. What aileth thee now, That all thine inhabitants are gone up to the house-tops? 
\v 2 Thou that wast full of noise, A tumultuous city, a joyous city! Thy slain fall not by the sword; They are not slain in battle. 
\v 3 All thy leaders flee together, By the bowmen are they bound; All found within thee are made captive together, Even they who have fled from afar. 
\v 4 Therefore, say I, look away from me, that I may weep bitterly; Strive not to comfort me for the desolation of the daughter of my people! 
\v 5 For a day of trouble, of desolation, and of perplexity cometh From the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, in the valley of vision. They break down the walls; The cry reacheth to the mountains. 
\v 6 Elam beareth the quiver, With chariots full of men, and with horsemen; Kir uncovereth the shield. 
\v 7 Thy fairest valleys, [[O Jerusalem,]] are full of chariots; The horsemen set themselves in array against the gate; 
\v 8 The veil of Judah is torn from her. But in such a day ye look to the armor of the house of the forest; 
\v 9 Ye mark how many are the breaches of the city of David, And collect the waters of the lower pool; 
\v 10 Ye number the houses of Jerusalem, And ye break down the houses to prepare the wall; 
\v 11 Ye make a reservoir between the two walls for the waters of the old pool; But ye look not to Him who hath done this; Ye regard not Him that hath prepared this from afar. 
\v 12 The Lord, Jehovah of hosts, calleth you this day To weeping and to lamentation, To baldness and to girding with sackcloth. 
\v 13 But, behold, joy and gladness, Slaying oxen and killing sheep, Eating flesh and drinking wine! “Let us eat and drink, For to-morrow we die!” 
\v 14 Therefore it hath been revealed in my ears by Jehovah of hosts; “This iniquity shall not be forgiven you, till ye die,” Saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts. 
\v 15 Thus saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts: Go in to this steward, To Shebna, who is over the household, and say, 
\v 16 What hast thou here, and whom hast thou here, That thou here hewest thee out a sepulchre,—That thou hewest out thy sepulchre on high, And gravest out a habitation for thyself in the rock? 
\v 17 Behold, Jehovah will cast thee headlong with a mighty thrust; 
\v 18 He will violently roll thee together like a ball; Like a ball will he hurl thee into a wide country. There shalt thou die; And there shall be thy splendid chariots, Thou disgrace of the house of thy lord! 
\v 19 I will drive thee from thy post, And from thy station I will pull thee down. 
\v 20 In that day I will call my servant, Even Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah; 
\v 21 I will clothe him with thy robe, And bind thy girdle around him; Thy government will I commit to his hand, And he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, And to the house of Judah. 
\v 22 I will lay the key of the house of David upon his shoulder; He shall open, and none shall shut, And he shall shut, and none shall open. 
\v 23 I will fasten him as a peg in a sure place, And he shall be a glorious seat for his father's house. 
\v 24 Upon him shall hang all the glory of his father's house, The offspring and the offshoots; Every small vessel, from the goblet even to all the pitchers. 
\v 25 In that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, The peg that was once fastened in a sure place shall be moved; It shall be cut down, and fall, And the burden which was upon it shall come to the ground. For Jehovah hath said it.

\v 1 The prophecy concerning Tyre. Howl, ye ships of Tarshish! For it is laid waste; No house, no entrance is left! From the land of the Chittaeans were the tidings brought to them. 
\v 2 Be amazed, ye inhabitants of the sea-coast, Which the merchants of Sidon, that pass over the sea, did crowd! 
\v 3 Upon the wide waters, the corn of the Nile, The harvest of the river, was her revenue; She was the mart of the nations. 
\v 4 Be thou ashamed, O Sidon, for the sea hath spoken, The fortress of the sea hath spoken thus: “I have not travailed, nor brought forth children; I have not nourished youths, nor brought up virgins.” 
\v 5 When the tidings shall reach Egypt, They shall be filled with anguish at the tidings concerning Tyre. 
\v 6 Pass ye over to Tarshish; Howl, ye inhabitants of the sea-coast! 
\v 7 Is this your joyous city, Whose antiquity is of ancient days? Now her own feet bear her To sojourn far away. 
\v 8 Who hath purposed this against Tyre, The dispenser of crowns, Whose merchants are princes, Whose traders the nobles of the earth? 
\v 9 Jehovah of hosts hath purposed it, To bring down the pride of all glory, To humble the nobles of the earth. 
\v 10 Go over thy land like the Nile, O daughter of Tarshish! Now thy bonds are broken. 
\v 11 He hath stretched out his hand over the sea, He hath made the kingdoms tremble; Jehovah hath given commandment concerning Canaan To destroy her strong holds. 
\v 12 He hath said, Thou shalt no more rejoice, Thou ravished virgin, daughter of Sidon! Arise, pass over to the Chittaeans; Yet even there shalt thou have no rest. 
\v 13 Behold the land of the Chaldaeans, Who, not long ago, were not a people,—The Assyrian assigned it to the inhabitants of the wilderness,—They raise their watch-towers; They destroy her palaces; They make her a heap of ruins. 
\v 14 Howl, ye ships of Tarshish! For your stronghold is destroyed. 
\v 15 And it shall come to pass in that day, That Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years, According to the days of one king; But at the end of seventy years It shall be with Tyre as in the song of the harlot: 
\v 16 “Take thy lyre, go about the city, O harlot, long forgotten; Make sweet melody; sing many songs, That thou mayst again be remembered!” 
\v 17 At the end of seventy years shall Jehovah show regard to Tyre, And she shall return to her hire, And play the harlot with all the kingdoms of the world, That are upon the face of the earth. 
\v 18 But her gain and her hire shall be holy to Jehovah; It shall not be treasured, nor laid up in store; But it shall be for them that dwell before Jehovah, For abundant food, and for splendid clothing. 
\c 24  
\p
\v 1 Behold, Jehovah emptieth and draineth the land; Yea, he turneth it upside down, and scattereth its inhabitants. 
\v 2 As with the people, so is it with the priest; As with the servant, so with the master; As with the maid, so with the mistress; As with the buyer, so with the seller; As with the borrower, so with the lender; As with the usurer, so with the giver of usury. 
\v 3 The land is utterly emptied and utterly plundered; For Jehovah hath spoken this word. 
\v 4 The land mourneth, and withereth; The world languisheth, and withereth; The nobles of the people of the land do languish. 
\v 5 The land was polluted under its inhabitants, Because they transgressed the law, they violated the statutes, They broke the everlasting covenant. 
\v 6 Therefore a curse devoured the land; Its inhabitants suffered for their guilt; Therefore are the inhabitants of the land consumed with heat, And few of the men are left. 
\v 7 The new wine mourneth; The vine languisheth; All that were of a joyful heart do sigh; 
\v 8 The mirth of tabrets ceaseth; The noise of them that rejoice is at an end; The joy of the harp ceaseth. 
\v 9 No more do they drink wine with the song; Strong drink is bitter to them that use it. 
\v 10 The city of desolation is broken down; Every house is closed, so that none can enter. 
\v 11 There is a cry for wine in the streets; All gladness is departed; The mirth of the land is gone; 
\v 12 Desolation is left in the city, And the gate is smitten into ruins. 
\v 13 Yea, thus shall it be in the land, in the midst of the people, As when the olive-tree has been shaken; As the gleaning, when the vintage is ended. 
\v 14 These shall lift up their voice, and sing; Yea, for the majesty of Jehovah they shall shout from the sea. 
\v 15 Wherefore praise ye Jehovah in the East, The name of Jehovah, the God of Israel, in the isles of the sea! 
\v 16 From the end of the earth we hear songs: “Glory to the righteous!” But I cry, Alas, my wretchedness, my wretchedness! woe is me! The plunderers plunder; the plunderers seize the spoil. 
\v 17 The terror, the pit, and the snare Are upon thee, O inhabitant of the land! 
\v 18 Whoso fleeth from the terror shall fall into the pit, And whoso escapeth from the pit, He shall be taken in the snare; For the floodgates of heaven are opened, And the foundations of the earth tremble. 
\v 19 The earth is utterly broken down; The earth is shattered in pieces; The earth is violently moved from her place. 
\v 20 The earth reeleth like a drunkard, It moveth to and fro like a hammock; For her iniquity lieth heavy upon her, And she shall fall and rise no more. 
\v 21 In that day will Jehovah punish the host of the high ones that are on high, And the kings of the earth upon the earth. 
\v 22 They shall be thrown together bound into the pit, And shall be shut up in the prison, But after many days shall they be visited. 
\v 23 The moon shall be confounded and the sun ashamed, When Jehovah of hosts shall reign in mount Zion and Jerusalem, And his glory shall be before his ancients. 
\c 25  
\p
\v 1 O Jehovah, thou art my God; I will exalt thee; I will praise thy name, For thou hast done wonderful things; Thine ancient purposes are faithfulness and truth. 
\v 2 Thou hast made the city a heap; The fortified city a ruin. The palace of the barbarians is to be no more a city! It shall never be built again. 
\v 3 Therefore shall mighty kingdoms praise thee; The cities of the terrible nations shall honor thee; 
\v 4 For thou hast been a defence to the poor; A defence to the needy in his distress; A refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, When the rage of tyrants was like a storm against a wall. 
\v 5 As heat in a dry land is made to vanish, So thou puttest down the tumult of the barbarians; As heat is allayed by a thick cloud, So the triumph of the tyrants is brought low. 
\v 6 Then in this mountain shall Jehovah of hosts prepare for all nations A feast of fat things, and wines kept on the lees; Of fat things full of marrow, of wines kept on the lees well refined. 
\v 7 He will destroy in this mountain the covering that was cast over all people, And the veil that was spread over all nations. 
\v 8 He will destroy death forever; The Lord Jehovah will wipe away the tears from all faces, And the reproach of his people will he take away from the whole earth; For Jehovah hath said it. 
\v 9 In that day shall men say, “Behold, this is our God; We waited for him, and he hath saved us; This is Jehovah, for whom we waited; Let us rejoice and exult in his salvation.” 
\v 10 For the hand of Jehovah shall rest upon this mountain, And Moab shall be trodden down in his place, As straw is trodden down in a dung-pool. 
\v 11 And he shall stretch out his hands in the midst of it, As the swimmer stretcheth out his hands to swim, But God shall put down his pride, Together with the devices of his hands. 
\v 12 And the high bulwarks of thy walls will he lay low; He will bring them down to the ground; he will lay them in the dust. 
\c 26  
\p
\v 1 In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah: “We have a strong city; His aid doth God appoint for walls and bulwarks. 
\v 2 Open ye the gates, That the righteous nation may enter in, The nation that keepeth the truth. 
\v 3 Him that is of a steadfast mind Thou wilt keep in continual peace, Because he trusteth in thee. 
\v 4 Trust ye in Jehovah forever, For the Lord Jehovah is an everlasting rock. 
\v 5 For he hath brought down the inhabitants of the fortress; The lofty city he hath laid low; He hath laid her low even to the ground; He hath levelled her with the dust. 
\v 6 The foot trampleth upon her, The feet of the poor, the steps of the needy. 
\v 7 The way of the upright is a smooth way; Thou, O most righteous, doth level the path of the upright! 
\v 8 In the way of thy judgments, O Jehovah, we have waited for thee; The desire of our souls is to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee. 
\v 9 My soul longeth for thee in the night, And my spirit within me seeketh thee in the morning; For when thy judgments are in the earth, The inhabitants of the world learn righteousness. 
\v 10 Though favor be shown to the wicked, He will not learn righteousness; In the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly, And have no regard to the majesty of Jehovah. 
\v 11 Thy hand, O Jehovah, is lifted up, yet do they not see; But they shall see with shame thy zeal for thy people; Yea, fire shall devour thine adversaries. 
\v 12 Thou, O Jehovah, wilt give us peace; For all our works thou doest for us. 
\v 13 O Jehovah, our God, other lords have had dominion over us besides thee; Only through thee do we call upon thy name. 
\v 14 They are dead, they shall not live; They are shades, they shall not rise. For thou hast visited and destroyed them, And caused all the memory of them to perish. 
\v 15 “Thou wilt enlarge the nation, O Jehovah! Thou wilt enlarge the nation; thou wilt glorify thyself; Thou wilt widely extend all the borders of the land. 
\v 16 O Jehovah, in affliction they sought thee; They poured out their prayer, when thy chastisement was upon them. 
\v 17 As a woman with child, when her delivery is near, Is in anguish, and crieth aloud in her pangs, So have we been, far from thy presence, O Jehovah! 
\v 18 We have been with child; we have been in anguish, Yet have, as it were, brought forth wind. To the land we bring no deliverance; Nor are the inhabitants of the land born. 
\v 19 O might thy dead live again, Might the dead bodies of my people arise! Awake, and sing, ye that dwell in the dust! For thy dew is like the dew upon plants, And the earth shall bring forth her dead.” 
\v 20 Come, my people, enter into thy chambers, And shut thy doors behind thee; Hide thyself for a little moment, Until the indignation be overpast! 
\v 21 For behold, Jehovah cometh forth from his place, To punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity; And the earth shall disclose her blood, And shall no longer cover her slain. 
\c 27  
\p
\v 1 In that day will Jehovah punish with his sword, His hard, and great, and strong sword, The leviathan, that fleet serpent, Even the leviathan, that winding serpent; Yea, he will slay the monster, that is in the sea. 
\v 2 In that day, sing ye thus concerning the vineyard: 
\v 3 “I, Jehovah, am its guardian; I will water it every moment; That no one may assault it, I will watch it day and night. 
\v 4 There is no fury in me; But let me find the thorns and thistles in battle. I will go against them, And burn them up together, 
\v 5 Unless they take hold of my protection, And with me make peace, And make peace with me.” 
\v 6 In coming days shall Jacob take root, And Israel flourish and bud forth, And fill the world with fruit. 
\v 7 Did he smite Israel, as he smote those that smote him? Was he slain as those that slew him? 
\v 8 In measure, by sending her away, didst thou punish her, Taking her away in the rough tempest, in the day of the east wind. 
\v 9 By this, therefore, is the iniquity of Jacob expiated, And this is wholly the fruit of the removal of his sin, That He has made the stones of the altar like limestones broken in pieces, And that the images of Astarte and the sun-pillars no more stand. 
\v 10 For the fortified city is desolate, A habitation forsaken, deserted like a wilderness; There doth the calf feed, and there doth he lie down, And consume her branches. 
\v 11 When her boughs are withered, they are broken off; Women come, and burn them; For it was a people of no understanding; Therefore he that made him had not mercy on him, And he that formed him showed him no favor. 
\v 12 But it shall come to pass in that day, That Jehovah shall gather fruit From the stream of the Euphrates to the river of Egypt, And ye shall be gathered, one by one, ye children of Israel! 
\v 13 In that day shall a great trumpet be sounded, And they shall come who are lost in the land of Assyria, And are outcasts in the land of Egypt, And shall worship Jehovah upon the holy mountain in Jerusalem. 
\c 28  
\p
\v 1 Woe to the proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim, To the fading flower, his glorious beauty, At the head of the rich valley of a people stupefied with wine. 
\v 2 Behold a strong, a mighty one from the Lord Like a storm of hail, like a destructive tempest, Like a flood of mighty, overflowing waters, With violence shall dash it to the ground. 
\v 3 It shall be trodden under foot, The proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim. 
\v 4 And the fading flower, their glorious beauty, At the head of the rich valley, Shall be as the early fig before the time of harvest, Which whoso seeth plucketh immediately, And swalloweth as soon as it is in his hand. 
\v 5 In that day shall Jehovah of hosts Be a glorious crown, and a beautiful diadem to the residue of his people; 
\v 6 A spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment, And of strength to them that drive back the enemy to their gates. 
\v 7 But even these stagger through wine, And reel through strong drink; The priest and the prophet stagger through strong drink; They are overpowered with wine; They stumble through strong drink; They reel in vision, They stagger in judgment. 
\v 8 For all their tables are full of filthy vomit, So that there is no place clean. 
\v 9 “Whom,” say they, “will he teach knowledge, And to whom will he impart instruction? To the weaned from the milk? To those just taken from the breast? 
\v 10 For it is precept upon precept, precept upon precept, Command upon command, command upon command, A little here, and a little there.” 
\v 11 Yea, with stammering lips and a strange tongue He shall indeed speak to this people; 
\v 12 He that said to them, “This is the way of rest, give rest to the weary; This is the way of safety”; But they would not hear. 
\v 13 Then shall the word of Jehovah be indeed to them “Precept upon precept, precept upon precept, Command upon command, command upon command, A little here, and a little there,” So that they shall go on, and fall backwards, and be broken, And be snared and caught. 
\v 14 Wherefore hear ye the word of Jehovah, Ye scoffers, who rule this people in Jerusalem! 
\v 15 Since ye say, “We have entered into a covenant with death, And with the under-world have we made an agreement, The overflowing scourge, when it passeth through, shall not reach us; For we have made falsehood our refuge, And in deceit we have hidden ourselves.” 
\v 16 Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I have laid in Zion as a foundation a stone, A tried stone, a precious corner-stone, a sure foundation; He that trusteth shall not flee away. 
\v 17 I will make justice a line, And righteousness a plummet, And the hail shall sweep away the refuge of falsehood, And the waters shall overwhelm its hiding-place; 
\v 18 And your covenant with death shall be broken, And your agreement with the under-world shall not stand; When the overflowing scourge shall pass through, By it shall ye be beaten down. 
\v 19 As often as it passeth through, it shall bear you away; For every morning shall it pass through, By day and by night; Even to hear the rumor of it shall be terrible. 
\v 20 Yea, the bed is too short for one to stretch himself on it, And the covering too narrow for one to wrap himself in it. 
\v 21 For Jehovah will rise up, as in mount Perazim; He will be moved with anger, as in the valley of Gibeon, To perform his act, his strange act, And to execute his work, his strange work. 
\v 22 Now, therefore, be ye no longer scoffers, Lest your bands become stronger; For destruction and punishment have been revealed to me From Jehovah of hosts concerning the whole land! 
\v 23 Give ear, and listen to my voice, Attend, and hearken to my words! 
\v 24 Is the ploughman always ploughing in order to sow? Is he always opening and harrowing his field? 
\v 25 When he hath made the face thereof even, Doth he not then scatter the dill, and cast abroad the cumin, And sow the wheat in rows, And the barley in its appointed place, And the spelt in his border? 
\v 26 Thus his God rightly instructeth him, And giveth him knowledge. 
\v 27 The dill is not beaten out with the thrashing-sledge, Nor is the wheel of the wain rolled over the cumin; But the dill is beaten out with a staff, And the cumin with a rod. 
\v 28 Bread-corn is beaten out, Yet doth not the husbandman thrash it without limit. He driveth over it the wheels of the wain, And the horses, yet doth he not utterly crush it. 
\v 29 This also proceedeth from Jehovah of hosts; He is wonderful in counsel, Excellent in wisdom. 
\c 29  
\p
\v 1 Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, The city where David dwelt! Add year to year, Let the festivals go round, 
\v 2 Then will I distress Ariel; Mourning and sorrow shall be there; Yet shall she be to me as Ariel [[the lion of God]]. 
\v 3 I will encamp against thee round about, And I will lay siege against thee with a mound, And I will raise towers against thee. 
\v 4 Thou shalt be brought down, and speak from the ground, And thy speech shall be low from the dust; Thy voice shall be like that of a spirit under ground, And thy speech shall chirp as from the dust. 
\v 5 Yet shall the multitude of thine enemies be like fine dust; The multitude of the terrible like flying chaff; It shall take place suddenly, in a moment. 
\v 6 From Jehovah of hosts cometh the visitation With thunder, and earthquake, and great noise, With storm and tempest, And flames of devouring fire. 
\v 7 As a dream, a vision of the night, Shall be the multitude of all the nations That fight against Ariel, That fight against her and her fortress, And distress her. 
\v 8 As a hungry man dreameth, and lo! he eateth, But awaketh and is still hungry; And as a thirsty man dreameth, and lo! he drinketh, But awaketh, and lo! he is faint and thirsty; So shall it be with the multitude of all the nations That fight against mount Zion. 
\v 9 Be in amazement and be amazed! Be blinded and be blind! They are drunk, but not with wine; They stagger, but not with strong drink! 
\v 10 For Jehovah hath poured upon you a spirit of slumber; He hath closed your eyes, the prophets, And covered your heads, the seers; 
\v 11 And so every vision is to you as the words of a sealed book, Which is given to a man that is skilled in writing, Saying, “Read this, I pray thee”; But he answereth, “I cannot, for it is sealed.” 
\v 12 Or, if he give it to one that is not skilled in writing, Saying, “Read this, I pray thee,” He answereth, “I am not skilled in writing.” 
\v 13 Therefore saith the Lord, Since this people draweth near to me with their mouth, And honoreth me with their lips, While their heart is far from me, And their worship of me is according to the commandments of men, 
\v 14 Therefore, behold, I will proceed to deal marvellously with this people; Marvellously and wonderfully, For the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, And the prudence of the prudent shall be hid. 
\v 15 Woe to them that hide deep their purposes from Jehovah, Whose work is in darkness; That say, Who seeth us? Who knoweth us? 
\v 16 Alas, your perverseness! Is the potter to be esteemed as the clay, That the work should say of its maker, He made me not? And the thing formed say of him that formed it, He hath no understanding? 
\v 17 Is it not yet a very little while, And Lebanon shall be changed to a fruitful field, And the fruitful field be esteemed a forest. 
\v 18 And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, And out of mist and darkness shall the eyes of the blind see. 
\v 19 The afflicted shall exceedingly rejoice in Jehovah, And the poor shall exult in the Holy One of Israel. 
\v 20 For the oppressor hath come to naught; the scoffer is destroyed; And all that watched for iniquity are cut off; 
\v 21 Who condemned a man in his cause, And laid snares for him who defended himself in the gate, And with falsehood caused the righteous to fail. 
\v 22 Therefore concerning the house of Jacob thus saith Jehovah, He that redeemed Abraham: No more shall Jacob be ashamed, And no more shall his face grow pale. 
\v 23 For when his children behold the work of my hands in the midst of them, They shall honor my name. They shall honor the Holy One of Jacob, And reverence the God of Israel. 
\v 24 They that erred in spirit shall come to understanding, And the obstinate shall receive instruction. 
\c 30  
\p
\v 1 Woe to the rebellious children, saith Jehovah, Who form plans, and not from me, And make covenants without my spirit, That they may add sin to sin! 
\v 2 Who go down into Egypt, Without inquiring at my mouth, To seek refuge in Pharaoh's protection, And to trust in the shadow of Egypt! 
\v 3 The protection of Pharaoh shall be your shame; Your trust in the shadow of Egypt your confusion. 
\v 4 For their princes are at Zoan, Their ambassadors have arrived at Hanes. 
\v 5 But they are all ashamed of a people that do not profit them; That are no help and no profit, But only a shame and a reproach. 
\v 6 The loaded beasts go southward. Through a land of anguish and distress, Whence come forth the lioness, and the fierce lion, The viper, and the flying fiery serpent; On the shoulders of young asses they carry their wealth, And on the bunches of camels their treasures, To a people that will not profit them! 
\v 7 Vain and empty is the help of Egypt; Wherefore I call her, The Blusterer that sitteth still. 
\v 8 Go now, write this on a tablet before them; Note it down upon a book, That it may remain for future times, A testimony forever! 
\v 9 For this is a rebellious people, false children; Children who will not hear the law of Jehovah; 
\v 10 Who say to the seers, “See not!” And to the prophets, “Prophesy not right things; Speak to us smooth things, Prophesy falsehood! 
\v 11 Turn aside from the way, Depart from the path, Remove from our sight the Holy One of Israel!” 
\v 12 Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel: Since ye despise this word, And trust in oppression and perverseness, And lean thereon, 
\v 13 Therefore shall this iniquity be to you Like a breach ready to give way, That swelleth out in a high wall, Whose fall cometh suddenly, in an instant. 
\v 14 It is broken like a potter's vessel, Which is dashed in pieces and not spared, So that among its fragments not a sherd is found to take up fire from the hearth, Or to dip water from the cistern. 
\v 15 For thus said the Lord Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel: By a return and by rest shall ye be saved; In quietness and confidence is your strength; 
\v 16 But ye would not. Ye said, “No! we will bound along upon horses”; Truly ye shall bound along in flight. “We will ride upon swift coursers”; But they shall be swift that pursue you. 
\v 17 A thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one, And ten thousand at the rebuke of five, Till what remains of you shall be as a beacon on the top of a mountain, As a banner upon a hill. 
\v 18 And yet will Jehovah wait to be gracious to you, And yet will he arise to have mercy upon you; For Jehovah is a righteous God; Happy are all they who wait for him! 
\v 19 For, O people of Zion, that dwellest in Jerusalem, Thou shalt not always weep! He will be very gracious to thee at the voice of thy cry; No sooner shall he hear it, than he will answer thee. 
\v 20 Though Jehovah hath given thee the bread of distress, and the water of affliction, Yet shall thy teachers be hidden from thee no more; But thine eyes shall see thy teachers. 
\v 21 And thine ears shall hear a voice behind thee, Saying, “This is the way, walk ye in it!” When ye turn aside to the right hand, or to the left. 
\v 22 Ye shall treat as defiled the silver coverings of your graven images, And the golden clothing of your molten images, Ye shall cast them away as an unclean thing; Away! shall ye say to them. 
\v 23 Then will he give rain for thy seed, With which thou shalt sow the ground, And the bread-corn, the produce of the land, shall be rich and nourishing; Then shall thy cattle feed in large pastures. 
\v 24 The oxen also, and the young asses, that till the ground, Shall eat well-seasoned provender, Which hath been winnowed with the shovel and the fan. 
\v 25 And on every lofty mountain, And on every high hill, Shall be brooks and streams of water, In the day of the great slaughter, When the towers fall. 
\v 26 Then shall the light of the moon be as the light of the sun, And the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, [[As the light of seven days,]] When Jehovah bindeth up the bruises of his people, And healeth the wound which they have received. 
\v 27 Behold, the name of Jehovah cometh from afar, His anger burneth, and violent is the flame, His lips are full of indignation, And his tongue like a devouring fire. 
\v 28 His breath is like an overflowing torrent, That reacheth even to the neck; He will toss the nation with the winnowing-fan of destruction; He will put a bridle upon the jaws of the people, that shall lead them astray. 
\v 29 But ye shall then sing as in the night of a solemn festival; Your heart shall be glad, like his who marcheth with the sound of the pipe To the mountain of Jehovah, to the rock of Israel. 
\v 30 Jehovah will cause his glorious voice to be heard, And the blow of his arm to be seen, With furious anger, and flames of devouring fire; With flood, and storm, and hailstones. 
\v 31 For by the voice of Jehovah shall the Assyrian be beaten down; He will smite him with the rod. 
\v 32 And as often as the appointed rod shall strike, Which Jehovah shall lay heavily upon him, It shall be accompanied with tabrets and harps; And with fierce battles will he fight against him. 
\v 33 For long hath the burning place been prepared; Yea, for the king hath it been made ready; The pile is made deep and broad; There is fire and wood in abundance; The breath of Jehovah, like a stream of brimstone, kindle it. 
\c 31  
\p
\v 1 Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help, And put their trust in horses, And confide in chariots, because they are many, And in horsemen, because their number is great, But look not to the Holy One of Israel, And resort not to Jehovah. 
\v 2 Yet he, too, is wise; He will bring evil, and not take back his words; He will arise against the house of the evil-doers, And against the help of them that do iniquity. 
\v 3 The Egyptians are men, and not God, And their horses are flesh, and not spirit. When Jehovah shall stretch forth his hand, Then shall the helper fall, and the helped be overthrown; And they shall all perish together. 
\v 4 For thus hath Jehovah said to me: As when the lion and the young lion growl over their prey, And a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him, By their noise he is not terrified, Nor by their tumult disheartened; So shall Jehovah of hosts come down to fight for mount Zion, and her hill. 
\v 5 As birds hover over their young, So shall Jehovah of hosts defend Jerusalem; He will defend and deliver, spare and save. 
\v 6 Turn, O ye children of Israel, To him from whom ye have so deeply revolted! For in that day shall every one cast away his idols of 
\v 7 silver and his idols of gold, Which your hands have made for sin. 
\v 8 The Assyrian shall fall by a sword not of man, Yea, a sword not of mortal shall devour him; He shall flee before the sword, And his young warriors shall be slaves. 
\v 9 Through fear shall he pass beyond his stronghold, And his princes shall be afraid of the standard. Thus saith Jehovah, who hath his fire in Zion, And his furnace in Jerusalem. 
\c 32  
\p
\v 1 Behold! a king shall reign in righteousness, And princes shall rule with equity. 
\v 2 Every one of them shall be a hiding-place from the wind, And a shelter from the tempest; As streams of water in a dry place, As the shadow of a great rock in a weary land. 
\v 3 The eyes of them that see shall no more be blind, And the ears of them that hear shall hearken. 
\v 4 The heart of the rash shall gain wisdom, And the tongue of the stammerer learn to speak plainly. 
\v 5 The vile shall no more be called liberal, Nor the niggard said to be bountiful; 
\v 6 For the vile will still utter villany, And his heart will devise iniquity; He will practise deception, and speak impiety against God; He will take away the food of the hungry, And deprive the thirsty of drink. 
\v 7 The instruments also of the niggard are evil; He plotteth mischievous devices, To destroy the poor with lying words, Even when the cause of the needy is just. 
\v 8 But the liberal deviseth liberal things, And in liberal things will he persevere. 
\v 9 Arise, hear my voice, ye women that are at ease! Give ear to my speech, ye careless daughters! 
\v 10 One year more, and ye shall tremble, ye careless women! For the vintage shall fail; the harvest shall not come. 
\v 11 Tremble, O ye that are at ease! Be in dismay, ye careless ones! Strip you, make you bare, gird ye sackcloth upon your loins! 
\v 12 They shall smite themselves on their breasts, On account of the pleasant fields, On account of the fruitful vine. 
\v 13 Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers; Yea, upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city. 
\v 14 For the palace shall be forsaken; The tumult of the city shall be solitary; The fortified hill and the tower shall be dens forever; The joy of wild-asses, the pasture of flocks; 
\v 15 Until the spirit from on high be poured upon us, And the wilderness become a fruitful field, And the fruitful field be esteemed a forest. 
\v 16 Then shall justice dwell in the wilderness, And righteousness in the fruitful field. 
\v 17 And the effect of righteousness shall be peace, And the fruit of righteousness quiet and security forever. 
\v 18 Then shall my people dwell in peaceful habitations, In secure dwellings, in quiet resting-places. 
\v 19 But the hail shall descend, and the forest shall fall; And the city shall be brought very low. 
\v 20 Happy ye who sow beside all waters; Who send forth thither the feet of the ox and the ass! 
\c 33  
\p
\v 1 Woe to thee, thou spoiler, who hast not been spoiled! Thou plunderer, who hast not been plundered! When thou hast ceased to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; When thou hast finished plundering, they shall plunder thee. 
\v 2 O Jehovah, have mercy upon us! in thee do we trust; Be thou our strength every morning, Our salvation in the time of trouble. 
\v 3 At the voice of thy thunder the people flee; When thou dost arise, the nations are scattered. 
\v 4 Your spoil shall be gathered, as the locust gathereth; As the locust runneth, so shall they run upon it. 
\v 5 Jehovah is exalted; Yea, he dwelleth on high; He filleth Zion with justice and righteousness. 
\v 6 There shall be security in thy times; Wisdom and knowledge shall be thy store of prosperity, And the fear of Jehovah, this shall be thy treasure! 
\v 7 Behold, the mighty men cry without: The ambassadors of peace weep bitterly. 
\v 8 The highways are desolate; The traveller ceaseth; He breaketh the covenant; he despiseth the cities; Of men he maketh no account. 
\v 9 The land mourneth and languisheth; Lebanon is put to shame, and withered away; Sharon is like a desert, And Bashan and Carmel are stripped of their leaves. 
\v 10 Now will I arise, saith Jehovah, Now will I exalt myself, Now will I lift myself up. 
\v 11 Ye shall conceive chaff, and bring forth stubble; Your own wrath is the fire which shall devour you. 
\v 12 The nations shall be burnt into lime; Like thorns cut down, they shall be consumed with fire. 
\v 13 Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; Mark, ye that are near, my power! 
\v 14 The sinners in Zion are struck with dread; Terror hath seized upon the unrighteous: “Who among us can dwell in devouring fire? Who among us can dwell in everlasting flames?” 
\v 15 He that walketh in righteousness, And speaketh that which is right, That despiseth the gain of oppression, And shaketh his hands from bribery, That stoppeth his ears, so as not to hear of blood, And shutteth his eyes, so as not to behold iniquity. 
\v 16 He shall dwell on high; The strongholds of rocks shall be his defence; His bread shall be given him; His water shall not fail. 
\v 17 Thine eyes shall see the king in his glory They shall survey a wide-extended land. 
\v 18 Thy heart shall meditate on the past terror: “Where now is the scribe? Where the weigher of tribute? Where he that numbered the towers?” 
\v 19 Thou shalt see no more a fierce people, A people of a dark language, which thou couldst not hear, And of a barbarous tongue, which thou couldst not understand; 
\v 20 Thou shalt see Zion, the city of our solemn feasts; Thine eyes shall behold Jerusalem, as a quiet habitation. A tent that shall never be moved, Whose stakes shall never be taken away, And whose cords shall never be broken. 
\v 21 For there the glorious Jehovah will be to us Instead of rivers and broad streams, Which no oared galley shall pass, And no gallant ship go through. 
\v 22 For Jehovah is our judge; Jehovah is our lawgiver; Jehovah is our king; it is he that will save us. 
\v 23 Thy ropes hang loose; They cannot hold the mast-socket, Nor can they spread the sail. Then shall a great spoil be divided; Even the lame shall take the prey. 
\v 24 No inhabitant shall say, I am sick; The people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity. 
\c 34  
\p
\v 1 Draw near, O ye nations, and hear! Attend, O ye people! Let the earth hear, and all that is therein; The world, and all that springs from it! 
\v 2 For the wrath of Jehovah is kindled against all the nations, And his fury against all their armies; He hath devoted them to destruction; He hath given them up to slaughter. 
\v 3 Their slain shall be cast out; From their carcasses their stench shall ascend, And the mountains shall flow down with their blood. 
\v 4 And all the hosts of heaven shall melt away; And the heavens shall be rolled up like a scroll, And all their host shall fall down, As the withered leaf faileth from the vine, As the blighted fruit from the fig-tree. 
\v 5 For my sword hath become drunk in heaven; Behold, upon Edom shall it descend, Upon the people under my curse, for vengeance. 
\v 6 The sword of Jehovah is full of blood; It is covered with fat, With the blood of lambs and goats, With the fat of the kidneys of rams; For Jehovah holdeth a sacrifice in Bozrah, And a great slaughter in the land of Edom. 
\v 7 The wild buffaloes shall fall down with them. And the bullocks with the bulls; The hind shall be drunk with blood, And the ground enriched with fat. 
\v 8 For Jehovah holdeth a day of vengeance, A year of recompense in the cause of Zion. 
\v 9 Her streams shall be turned into pitch, And her dust into brimstone, And her whole land shall become burning pitch. 
\v 10 Day and night it shall not be quenched; Its smoke shall ascend forever; From generation to generation it shall lie waste; None shall pass through it for ever and ever. 
\v 11 The pelican and the hedgehog shall possess it; The heron and the raven shall dwell in it; Over it will he draw the measuring-line of destruction. And the plummet of desolation. 
\v 12 Her nobles — none are there, who may proclaim a kingdom, And all her princes have come to naught. 
\v 13 Thorns shall spring up in her palaces; Nettles and thistles in her strongholds. She shall become a habitation for jackals, A court for ostriches. 
\v 14 The wild-cats shall fall upon the wolves, And the satyr shall call to his fellow; There also shall the night-spectre light, And find a place of rest. 
\v 15 There also shall the arrow-snake make her nest, and lay her eggs; She shall hatch them, and gather her young under her shadow: There also shall the vultures be gathered together, Every one with her mate. 
\v 16 Search ye the book of Jehovah, and read! Not one of these shall fail; Not one shall want her mate; For His mouth, it shall command, And His spirit, it shall gather them. 
\v 17 He shall cast the lot for them; His hand shall divide it for them with a line; They shall possess it forever; From generation to generation shall they dwell therein. 
\c 35  
\p
\v 1 The wilderness and the parched land shall be glad, And the desert rejoice and blossom as the rose; 
\v 2 It shall blossom abundantly, and exult with joy and singing; The glory of Lebanon shall be given to it; The beauty of Carmel and Sharon; They shall behold the glory of Jehovah, The majesty of our God; 
\v 3 Strengthen ye the weak hands, And confirm the tottering knees! 
\v 4 Say ye to the faint-hearted, “Be ye strong; fear ye not; Behold your God! Vengeance cometh, the retribution of God; He will come and save you!” 
\v 5 Then shall the eyes of the blind be opened, And the ears of the deaf be unstopped. 
\v 6 Then shall the lame leap like the hart, And the tongue of the dumb shall sing; For in the wilderness shall waters break forth, And streams in the desert. 
\v 7 The glowing sands shall become a pool, And the thirsty ground springs of water; In the habitation of jackals, where they lie, Shall be a place for reeds and rushes. 
\v 8 And a path shall be there, and a highway, And it shall be called the holy way; No unclean person shall pass over it; it shall be for them alone; He that therein goeth in this way, though a fool, shall not err therein. 
\v 9 No lion shall be there, Nor shall any ravenous beast go up thereon; It shall not be found there; But the redeemed shall walk there. 
\v 10 Yea, the ransomed of Jehovah shall return; They shall come to Zion with songs: Everlasting joy shall be upon their heads; They shall obtain joy and gladness, And sorrow and sighing shall flee away. 
\c 36  
\p
\v 1 In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, came up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them. 
\v 2 And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem, with a great army, against King Hezekiah, and he halted at the aqueduct of the upper pool, in the highway to the fuller's field. 
\v 3 Then came forth to him Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, who was over the palace, and Shebna the scribe, and Josh, the son of Asaph, the annalist. 
\v 4 And Rabshakeh said to them, Say ye to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria: What a confidence is this which thou cherishest! 
\v 5 Thou sayest, (but it is vain talk,) “I have counsel and strength for war.” In whom, then, dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me? 
\v 6 Behold, thou trustest in that broken reed-staff, Egypt, on which if a man lean, it will pierce his hand, and go through it. Such is Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to all that trust in him. 
\v 7 But if ye say to me, “We trust in Jehovah, our God,”—is it not he whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem to worship before this altar? 
\v 8 Engage, now, with my master, the king of Assyria! and I will give thee two thousand horses, when thou art able to provide for thyself riders for them. 
\v 9 How, then, canst thou resist a single captain, one of the least of the servants of my master? Yet thou trustest in Egypt, on account of her chariots and her horsemen. 
\v 10 And am I now come up without Jehovah against this land to destroy it? Jehovah hath said to me, “Go up against this land and destroy it!” 
\v 11 Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Josh to Rabshakeh: Speak, we beseech thee, to thy servants in the Aramaic language, for we understand it; and speak not to us in the Jewish language, in the hearing of the people that are upon the wall. 
\v 12 But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to speak these words to thy master and to thee only, and not to the people who sit upon the wall, to eat their own dung, and to drink their own urine with you? 
\v 13 Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jewish language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria. 
\v 14 Thus saith the king: Let not Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you. 
\v 15 And let not Hezekiah persuade you to trust in Jehovah, saying, “Jehovah will certainly deliver us. This city shall not be delivered into the hands of the king of Assyria.” 
\v 16 Hearken not to Hezekiah; for thus saith the king of Assyria: Make peace with me, and come out to me; and ye shall every one eat of his own vine, and every one of his own fig-tree, and ye shall every one drink the waters of his own cistern, 
\v 17 until I come, and take you to a land like your own land; a land of corn, and of new wine, a land of bread and of vineyards. 
\v 18 Be not persuaded by Hezekiah, when he saith, “Jehovah will deliver us.” Have the gods of the nations delivered every one his own land from the hand of the king of Assyria? Where are the gods of Hamath and of Arphad? 
\v 19 Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? And did the gods deliver Samaria from my hand? 
\v 20 Who is there among all the gods of these lands, that hath delivered his land out of my hand, that Jehovah should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand? 
\v 21 But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word; for the king's command was, “Answer him not.” 
\v 22 Then came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, that was over the palace, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the annalist, to Hezekiah, with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh. 
\c 37  
\p
\v 1 And when the king, Hezekiah, heard it, he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of Jehovah. 
\v 2 And he sent Eliakim, who was over the palace, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz. 
\v 3 And they said to him, Thus saith Hezekiah: This day is a day of distress, of rebuke, and of contempt; for the children have come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth. 
\v 4 It may be that Jehovah, thy God, will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria, his master, hath sent to reproach the living God, and to revile him with the words which Jehovah, thy God, hath heard. Do thou, therefore, lift up thy prayer for the remnant of the people, that is yet left. 
\v 5 And the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah. 
\v 6 And Isaiah said to them, Thus shall ye say to your master: Thus saith Jehovah: Be not afraid on account of the words which thou hast heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me. 
\v 7 Behold, I will put a spirit within him, so that he shall hear a rumor, and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land. 
\v 8 Then Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah, for he had heard that he had departed from Lachish. 
\v 9 Then he heard concerning Tirhakah, king of Ethiopia, that it was said, “He is come forth to war against thee.” And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah and said, 
\v 10 Thus shall ye say to Hezekiah, the king of Judah: Let not thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. 
\v 11 Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the lands; how they have utterly destroyed them. And shalt thou be delivered? 
\v 12 Did the gods of the nations which my father destroyed, deliver them? Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden in Telassar? 
\v 13 Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arphad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Henah, and of Ivah? 
\v 14 And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it. Then he went up to the house of Jehovah, and spread it before Jehovah. 
\v 15 And Hezekiah prayed before Jehovah, saying, 
\v 16 O Jehovah of hosts, God of Israel, who sittest between the cherubs, thou alone art the God of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven and earth. 
\v 17 Incline thine ear, O Jehovah, and hear; open thine eyes, O Jehovah, and see; and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which he hath sent to reproach the living God. 
\v 18 In truth, O Jehovah, the kings of Assyria have destroyed all the nations, and their lands, 
\v 19 and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were not gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone; and they have destroyed them. 
\v 20 But do thou, O Jehovah, our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou alone art Jehovah. 
\v 21 Then Isaiah, the son of Amoz, sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Whereas thou hast prayed to me on account of Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, 
\v 22 This is the word which Jehovah hath spoken against him. The virgin, the daughter of Zion, despiseth thee; she laugheth thee to scorn; The daughter of Jerusalem shaketh her head after thee. 
\v 23 Whom hast thou reproached, and reviled, And against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, And lifted up thine eyes on high? Against the Holy One of Israel. 
\v 24 By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord, and said: “With the multitude of my chariots have I ascended the heights of the mountains, the extremities of Lebanon; I have cut down its tall cedars, and its choice cypress-trees; I have come to its utmost height, to its garden forest. 
\v 25 I have digged and drunk water, And with the sole of my feet will I dry up all the rivers of Egypt.” 
\v 26 Hast thou not heard, that of old I ordained it, And from ancient times purposed it? Now have I brought it to pass, That thou shouldst convert fortified cities into ruinous heaps. 
\v 27 Therefore were their inhabitants of little strength; They were dismayed and confounded; They were as the grass of the field, and the green herb; As grass upon the house-top, and as corn blasted, before it is grown up. 
\v 28 I know thy sitting down, thy going out, and thy coming in, And thy rage against me. 
\v 29 Because thy rage against me, and thy insolence, is come up into my ears, I will put my ring into thy nose, And my bridle into thy lips, And turn thee back by the way in which thou camest. 
\v 30 And this shall be the sign to thee; Eat this year that which groweth of itself, And in the second year that which groweth of itself, And in the third year ye shall sow and reap, And plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof. 
\v 31 And the remnant of the house of Judah, that have escaped, Shall again strike root downward, And bear fruit upward. 
\v 32 For from Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, And they that have escaped from mount Zion. The zeal of Jehovah of hosts will perform this. 
\v 33 Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts concerning the king of Assyria; He shall not come into this city, Nor shoot an arrow into it; He shall not present a shield before it, Nor cast up a mound against it. 
\v 34 By the way in which he came, by the same shall he return, And into this city shall he not come, saith Jehovah. 
\v 35 For I will defend this city, and deliver it, For mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake. 
\v 36 Then an angel of Jehovah went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty-five thousand men; and when the people arose early in the morning, behold they were all dead corpses. 
\v 37 Then Sennacherib, king of Assyria, decamped, and went away, and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh. 
\v 38 And as he was worshipping in the temple of Nisroch, his god, he was slain with the sword by his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer, who escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon, his son, reigned in his stead. 
\c 38  
\p
\v 1 In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death; and Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, came to him, and said to him, Set thy house in order, for thou shalt die, and not live. 
\v 2 Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and made his supplication to Jehovah. 
\v 3 And he said, I beseech thee, O Jehovah, remember now how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thine eyes! And Hezekiah wept bitterly. 
\v 4 Then came the word of Jehovah to Isaiah, 
\v 5 Go in and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of David thy father: I have heard thy prayer; I have seen thy tears. Behold, I will add to thy life fifteen years. 
\v 6 And I will deliver thee and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria, and I will defend this city. 
\v 7 And this shall be the sign to thee from Jehovah, that Jehovah will do that which he hath spoken. 
\v 8 Behold, I will cause the shadow upon the dial, which hath gone down upon the dial of Ahaz with the sun, to go back ten degrees. So the sun went back ten degrees, which degrees it had gone down. 
\v 9 The writing of Hezekiah, king of Judah, when he had been sick, and had recovered from his sickness. 
\v 10 I said: “Now, in the quiet of my days, shall I go down to the gates of the under-world; I am deprived of the residue of my years.” 
\v 11 I said: “No more shall I see Jehovah, Jehovah in the land of the living. I shall behold man no more Among the inhabitants of stillness. 
\v 12 My habitation is torn away and removed from me, Like a shepherd's tent; My life is rolled up as by the weaver; He cutteth me off from the thrum; Between morning and night wilt thou make an end of me!” 
\v 13 I waited till morning, and like a lion Did he crush all my bones; “Between morning and night wilt thou make an end of me!” 
\v 14 Like a swallow or a crane, so did I twitter; I did mourn as a dove; Mine eyes failed with looking upward; “O Lord, I am in distress; O, deliver me!” 
\v 15 What shall I say? He promised it, and he hath done it; I will walk humbly all my life On account of the bitterness of my soul. 
\v 16 Lord, it is thus that men live; From thee alone cometh the life of my spirit; Thou hast restored me, and caused me to live. 
\v 17 Behold, my anguish is changed into ease; In love thou hast delivered me from the pit of destruction; Thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back. 
\v 18 For the under-world cannot praise thee; The realms of death cannot celebrate thee; They that go down to the pit cannot wait for thy faithfulness. 
\v 19 The living, the living praise thee, as I do this day; The father to the children shall make known thy faithfulness. 
\v 20 Jehovah hath saved me; Therefore will we sing our songs with stringed instruments, All the days of our life, In the house of Jehovah. 
\v 21 Now Isaiah had said, let them take a lump of figs, and bruise them, and lay them upon the ulcer, and he shall recover. 
\v 22 Hezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of Jehovah? 
\c 39  
\p
\v 1 At that time Merodach Baladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent a letter and a present to Hezekiah, for he had heard that he had been sick and was recovered. 
\v 2 And Hezekiah was delighted with them, and showed the embassy his treasure-house, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious oil, and his whole armory, and all that was found in his treasures. There was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, which Hezekiah did not show them. 
\v 3 Then came Isaiah the prophet to King Hezekiah, and said to him, What did these men say, and whence did they come to thee? And Hezekiah said, They came to me from a distant country, from Babylon. 
\v 4 Then said he, What have they seen in thy house? And Hezekiah answered: All that is in my house have they seen. There is nothing in my treasures which I have not shown them. 
\v 5 Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, hear the word of Jehovah of hosts, 
\v 6 Behold, the days shall come, when all that is in thy house, and that thy fathers have treasured up to this day, shall be carried away to Babylon. Nothing shall be left, saith Jehovah. 
\v 7 And of thy sons, which shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away, and they shall he eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon. 
\v 8 (39:7) Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good is the word of Jehovah, which thou hast spoken. For, said he, there shall be peace and security in my days. 
\c 40  
\p
\v 1 Comfort ye, comfort ye, my people, Saith your God. 
\v 2 Speak ye encouragement to Jerusalem, and declare to her, That her hard service is ended; That her iniquity is expiated; That she hath received from the hand of Jehovah Double for all her sins. 
\v 3 A voice crieth: “Prepare ye in the wilderness the way of Jehovah; Make straight in the desert a highway for our God! 
\v 4 Every valley shall be exalted, And every mountain and hill be made low; The crooked shall become straight, And the rough places plain. 
\v 5 For the glory of Jehovah shall be revealed, And all flesh shall see it together; For the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken it!” 
\v 6 A voice said, Proclaim! And I said, What shall I proclaim? All flesh is grass, And all its comeliness as the flower of the field. 
\v 7 The grass withereth, the flower fadeth, When the breath of Jehovah bloweth upon it. Truly the people is grass. 
\v 8 The grass withereth, the flower fadeth, But the word of our God shall stand forever. 
\v 9 Get thee up on the high mountain, O thou that bringest glad tidings to Zion; Lift up thy voice with strength, thou that bringest glad tidings to Jerusalem; Lift it up; be not afraid; Say to the cities of Judah, Behold your God! 
\v 10 Behold, the Lord Jehovah shall come with might, And his arm shall rule for him; Behold, his reward is with him, And his recompense before him. 
\v 11 He shall feed his flock like a shepherd; He shall gather up the lambs in his arms, And carry them in his bosom, And gently lead the nursing ewes. 
\v 12 Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, And meted out the heavens with his span, And gathered the dust of the earth into a measure, And weighed the mountains in scales, And the hills in a balance? 
\v 13 Who hath searched out the spirit of Jehovah, Or, being his counsellor, hath taught him? 
\v 14 With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, And taught him the path of justice, And taught him knowledge, And showed him the way of understanding? 
\v 15 Behold, the nations are as a drop from a bucket, And are accounted as the small dust of the balance; Behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing, 
\v 16 And Lebanon is not sufficient for fire, Nor its beasts for a burnt-offering. 
\v 17 All the nations are as nothing before him; They are accounted by him as less than nothing, and vanity. 
\v 18 To whom then will ye liken God, And what likeness will ye compare unto him? 
\v 19 The workman casteth an image, And the smith overlayeth it with gold, And casteth for it silver chains. 
\v 20 He that is too poor to make an oblation Chooseth a piece of wood that will not rot; He seeketh for himself a skilful artificer, To prepare an image that shall not be moved. 
\v 21 Do ye not know? Have ye not heard? Hath it not been declared to you from the beginning? Have ye not considered the foundations of the earth? 
\v 22 It is He that sitteth above the circle of the earth, And the inhabitants are to him as grasshoppers; That stretcheth out the heavens as a canopy, And spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in; 
\v 23 That bringeth princes to nothing, And reduceth the rulers of the earth to vanity. 
\v 24 Yea, scarcely are they planted, scarcely are they sown, Scarcely hath their stem taken root in the ground, When He bloweth upon them and they wither, And the whirlwind beareth them away like stubble. 
\v 25 To whom then will ye liken me, And to whom shall I be compared? Saith the Holy One. 
\v 26 Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and behold! Who hath created these? He draweth forth their host by number, He calleth them all by name; Through the greatness of his strength and the mightiness of his power, Not one of them faileth to appear. 
\v 27 Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, “My way is hidden from Jehovah, My cause passeth by before my God”? 
\v 28 Do ye not know? Have ye not heard? Jehovah is an everlasting God, The creator of the ends of the earth; He fainteth not, nor is he weary; His understanding is unsearchable. 
\v 29 He giveth power to the faint; To the feeble abundant strength. 
\v 30 The youths shall faint and be weary, And the young warriors shall utterly fall. 
\v 31 But they that trust in Jehovah shall renew their strength; They shall mount up with wings like eagles; They shall run and not be weary; They shall walk and not faint. 
\c 41  
\p
\v 1 Keep silence, and hear me, ye distant lands. Ye nations, gather your strength! Let them come near; then let them speak; Let us go together into judgment. 
\v 2 Who hath raised up from the region of the East Him whom victory meeteth in his march? Who hath subdued nations before him, And given him dominion over kings? Who made their swords like dust, And their bows like driven stubble? 
\v 3 He pursued them, and passed in safety, By a path which his foot had never trodden. 
\v 4 Who hath wrought and done it? I, who have called the generations from the beginning, I, Jehovah, the first; And with the last also am I. 
\v 5 Distant nations saw it, and were afraid; The ends of the earth, and trembled; They drew near, and came together. 
\v 6 One helped another, And said to him, “Be of good courage!” 
\v 7 The carpenter encouraged the smith, He that smoothed with the hammer him that smote on the anvil, And said, “The soldering is good,” And he fastened it with nails that it might not fall. 
\v 8 But thou, O Israel, my servant, Thou, Jacob, whom I have chosen, Offspring of Abraham, my friend! 
\v 9 Thou, whom I have led by the hand from the ends of the earth, And called from the extremities thereof, And said to thee, “Thou art my servant, I have chosen thee, and not cast thee away!” 
\v 10 Fear not, for I am with thee; Faint not, for I, thy God, will strengthen thee; I will help thee, and sustain thee, with my right hand of salvation! 
\v 11 Behold, all who are enraged against thee Shall be ashamed and confounded; All that contend with thee Shall come to nothing and perish. 
\v 12 Thou shalt seek and not find Them that contend with thee; They shall come to nothing, and be no more, Who make war against thee. 
\v 13 For I, Jehovah, am thy God, that holdeth thee by the right hand, That saith to thee, “Fear not, I am thy helper!” 
\v 14 Fear not, thou worm Jacob, thou feeble people of Israel! I am thy helper, saith Jehovah; Thy redeemer is the Holy One of Israel. 
\v 15 Behold, I will make thee a thrashing-wain, sharp and new, With double edges; Thou shalt thrash the mountains, and beat them small, And make the hills as chaff. 
\v 16 Thou shalt winnow them, and the wind shall carry them away, And the whirlwind shall scatter them. But thou shalt rejoice in Jehovah, And glory in the Holy One of Israel. 
\v 17 When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, And their tongue is parched with thirst, I, Jehovah, will hear them; I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them. 
\v 18 I will open rivers upon the bare hills, And fountains in the midst of the valleys; I will make the wilderness a pool of water, And the dry land springs of water. 
\v 19 I will plant in the wilderness the cedar and the acacia, The myrtle and the olive-tree; I will place in the desert the cypress, The plane-tree and the larch together. 
\v 20 That they may see, and know, And consider, and understand together, That the hand of Jehovah hath done this, And that the Holy One of Israel hath created it. 
\v 21 Bring forward your cause, saith Jehovah; Produce your strong reasons, saith the king of Jacob. 
\v 22 Let them produce them, and show us what shall happen! Tell us what ye have predicted in times past, That we may consider, and know its fulfilment! Or declare to us things that are to come! 
\v 23 Let us hear what shall happen in future times, That we may know whether ye are gods; Do something, be it good or evil, That we may be astonished, and see it together! 
\v 24 Behold, ye are less than nothing, And your work is less than naught; An abomination is he that chooseth you! 
\v 25 I have raised up one from the north, and he cometh; From the rising of the sun he calleth upon my name; He trampleth upon princes as upon mortar; As the potter treadeth down the clay. 
\v 26 Who hath declared this from the beginning, that we might know it, And long ago, that we might say, It is true? There was not one that foretold it, not one that declared it, Not one that heard your words. 
\v 27 I first said to Zion, Behold! behold them! And I gave to Jerusalem a messenger of glad tidings. 
\v 28 I looked, but there was no man; Even among them, but there was none that gave counsel; I inquired of them that they might give an answer; 
\v 29 But behold, they are all vanity; Their works are nothing; Wind and emptiness are their molten images. 
\c 42  
\p
\v 1 Behold my servant, whom I uphold, My chosen, in whom my soul delighteth, I have put my spirit upon him; He shall cause law to go forth to the nations. 
\v 2 He shall not cry aloud, nor lift up his voice, Nor cause it to be heard in the street. 
\v 3 The bruised reed shall he not break, And the glimmering flax shall he not quench; He shall send forth law according to truth. 
\v 4 He shall not fail, nor become weary, Until he shall have established justice in the earth. And distant nations shall wait for his law. 
\v 5 Thus saith God Jehovah, Who created the heavens and stretched them out, Who spread forth the earth, and that which springeth forth from it, Who gave breath to the people upon it, And spirit to them that walk thereon: 
\v 6 I, Jehovah, have called thee for salvation; I will hold thee by the hand; I will defend thee, and make thee a covenant to the people, A light to the nations; 
\v 7 To open the blind eyes, To bring out the prisoners from the prison, And them that sit in darkness out of the prison-house. 
\v 8 I am Jehovah, that is my name; And my glory will I not give to another, Nor my praise to graven images. 
\v 9 The former things, behold! they are come to pass, And new things do I now declare; Before they spring forth, I make them known to you. 
\v 10 Sing to Jehovah a new song; His praise to the ends of the earth; Ye that go down upon the sea, and all that fill it; Ye distant coasts, and ye that dwell therein! 
\v 11 Let the desert cry aloud, and the cities thereof; The villages, that Kedar inhabiteth; Let the inhabitants of the rock sing; Let them shout from the top of the mountains! 
\v 12 Let them give glory to Jehovah, And proclaim his praise in distant lands! 
\v 13 Jehovah shall march forth like a hero; Like a mighty warrior shall he rouse his indignation, He shall cry aloud; he shall shout the war-cry, And show himself mighty against his enemies. 
\v 14 “I have long held my peace; I have been still and refrained myself; But now will I cry like a woman in travail; I will destroy and swallow up at once. 
\v 15 I will lay waste mountains and hills, And dry up all their herbs. I will make the river solid land, And dry up the pools of water. 
\v 16 Then will I lead the blind in a way which they know not, And in unknown paths will I guide them; I will make darkness light before them, And crooked paths straight; These things will I do for them, and not forsake them.” 
\v 17 Then shall they be turned back, and be put to shame, Who trust in graven images; Who say to molten images, “Ye are our gods!” 
\v 18 Hear, O ye deaf! And look, ye blind, and see! 
\v 19 Who is blind, if not my servant? And who so deaf as my messenger, whom I send? Who so blind as the friend of God, So blind as the servant of Jehovah? 
\v 20 Thou seest many things, but regardest them not; Thou hast thine ears open, but hearest not! 
\v 21 It pleased Jehovah for his goodness' sake To give him a law, great and glorious; 
\v 22 And yet it is a robbed and plundered people; They are all of them bound in prisons, And hid in dungeons; They have become a spoil, and none delivereth; A prey, and none saith, “Restore!” 
\v 23 Who is there among you that will give ear to this, That will listen and attend for the time to come? 
\v 24 Who gave Jacob to be a spoil, And Israel to plunderers? Was it not Jehovah, against whom we sinned, In whose ways we would not walk, And whose laws we would not obey? 
\v 25 Therefore hath he poured out upon Israel the fury of his wrath, and the violence of war; It kindled a flame around about him, yet he did not regard it; It set him on fire, yet he laid it not to heart. 
\c 43  
\p
\v 1 But now thus saith Jehovah, that created thee, O Jacob, That formed thee, O Israel: Fear not, for I have redeemed thee; I have called thee by name; thou art mine! 
\v 2 When thou passest through waters, I will be with thee; And through rivers, they shall not overflow thee; When thou walkest through fire, thou shalt not be burned, And the flame shall not consume thee. 
\v 3 For I am Jehovah, thy God, The Holy One of Israel, thy saviour. I will give Egypt for thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for thee; 
\v 4 Because thou art precious in my sight, Because thou art honored, and I love thee, Therefore will I give men for thee, And nations for thy life. 
\v 5 Fear not, for I am with thee! I will bring thy children from the East, And gather thee from the West. 
\v 6 I will say to the North, “Give them up!” And to the South, “Withhold them not! Bring my sons from afar, And my daughters from the ends of the earth; 
\v 7 Every one that is called by my name, That I have created for my glory, That I have formed and made!” 
\v 8 Bring forth the blind people, having eyes, And the deaf, having ears. 
\v 9 Let all the nations be gathered together, And the kingdoms be assembled! Who among them hath declared this, And can show us former predictions? Let them produce their witnesses that they are right; That men may hear, and say, It is true! 
\v 10 Ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, And my servant whom I have chosen, That ye may know and believe me, And understand that I am He. Before me was no god formed, And after me there shall be none. 
\v 11 I, I am Jehovah, And besides me there is no saviour. 
\v 12 I have declared and have saved; I made it known, when there was no strange god among you; Ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, That I am God. 
\v 13 Even from the beginning of time I have been He, And none can rescue from my hand; I undertake, and who can hinder? 
\v 14 Thus saith Jehovah, Your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; For your sakes have I sent to Babylon, And caused all her fugitives, And the Chaldeans, to descend to the ships of their delight. 
\v 15 I, Jehovah, am your Holy One, The creator of Israel, your king. 
\v 16 Thus saith Jehovah,—He that made a way in the sea, And a path in the mighty waters, 
\v 17 That caused the chariot and the horse, the army and the forces, to march forth; There they lay down together; they rose no more; They were extinguished; they were quenched like a torch;— 
\v 18 Remember not the former things; The things of old regard no more! 
\v 19 Behold, I do a new thing; Now shall it spring forth; yea, ye shall see it. Behold, I make a way in the wilderness, And streams in the desert; 
\v 20 The beasts of the forest shall honor me, The jackals and the ostriches; For I make rivers in the wilderness And streams in the desert, To give drink to my people, my chosen. 
\v 21 This people, which I have formed for myself Shall make known my praise. 
\v 22 Yet thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob, So as to have wearied thyself for me, O Israel! 
\v 23 Thou hast not brought me thy lambs for a burnt-offering, Nor honored me with thy sacrifices; I have not burdened thee with oblations, Nor wearied thee with incense; 
\v 24 Thou hast bought me no sweet-smelling reed with silver, Neither hast thou satisfied me with the fat of thy sacrifices; With thy sins hast thou burdened me, And wearied me with thine iniquities. 
\v 25 I, I myself, blot out thy transgressions for my own sake, And will not remember thy sins. 
\v 26 Put me in remembrance; let us plead together; Speak that thou mayst justify thyself. 
\v 27 Thy forefathers sinned, And thy teachers were rebellious against me; 
\v 28 Therefore have I profaned the princes of the sanctuary, And given up Jacob to a curse, And Israel to reproach. 
\c 44  
\p
\v 1 Yet now hear, O Jacob, my servant, And Israel, whom I have chosen; 
\v 2 Thus saith Jehovah, thy Creator, He that formed thee, and hath helped thee from thy birth, Fear not, O Jacob, my servant, O Jeshurun, whom I have chosen. 
\v 3 For I will pour water upon the thirsty land, And streams upon the dry ground. I will pour out my spirit on thy children, And my blessing on thine offspring; 
\v 4 And they shall grow up, as among grass; As willows by the water-brooks. 
\v 5 One shall say, “I belong to Jehovah”; Another shall call upon the name of Jacob; Another shall write upon his hand, Jehovah's! And praise the name of Israel. 
\v 6 Thus saith Jehovah, the King of Israel, His redeemer, Jehovah of hosts: I am the first, and I the last, And besides me there is no God. 
\v 7 Who like me hath proclaimed the future,—Let him declare it, and set it in order before me!— Since I established the people of old? Let them make known the future, even that which is to come! 
\v 8 Fear ye not, neither be ye afraid! Have I not declared and made it known to you of old? Ye are my witnesses; Is there a God beside me? Yea, there is no other rock; I know not any. 
\v 9 They that make a graven image are all of them vanity, And their valued works are profitable for nothing; They are their own witnesses; They neither see nor understand, So that they may be ashamed. 
\v 10 Who hath formed a god, And cast a graven image, that is profitable for nothing? 
\v 11 Behold, all his fellows shall be ashamed; The workmen are themselves mortal men; They shall all be assembled; they shall stand up; They shall tremble, and be put to shame together! 
\v 12 The smith prepareth an axe in the coals, And fashioneth it with hammers, And worketh it with his strong arm; He becometh hungry, and his strength faileth; He drinketh no water, and is faint. 
\v 13 The carpenter stretcheth out the line; He marketh out the form of it with the sharp tool; He formeth it with planes; He marketh it with the compass; He maketh it in the figure of a man, With the beauty of a man, To dwell in a house. 
\v 14 He heweth him down cedars; He taketh the ilex and the oak; He chooseth for himself among the trees of the forest; He planteth the ash, and the rain matureth it; 
\v 15 These are fuel for man; He taketh thereof and warmeth himself; He kindleth with it, and baketh bread; A god also he formeth of it, and worshippeth it; A graven image, and falleth down before it. 
\v 16 Half of it he burneth with fire; With half of it he eateth flesh; He roasteth meat, and satisfieth himself; He also warmeth himself, and saith, Aha! I am warm; I feel the fire. 
\v 17 Of the residue he maketh a god, even his graven image; He falleth down before it and worshippeth it, And prayeth to it, and saith, “Deliver me, for thou art my God!” 
\v 18 They know not, neither understand; For their eyes are closed up, that they cannot see, And their hearts, that they cannot understand. 
\v 19 None considereth in his mind, Or hath knowledge and understanding to say: “Half of it I have burned with fire; I have also baked bread on the coals of it; I have roasted flesh and have eaten; And shall I make the remnant an abomination? Shall I fall down before the stock of a tree?” 
\v 20 He toileth for ashes; A deluded heart turneth him aside, So that he cannot deliver himself, and say “Is there not a lie in my right hand?” 
\v 21 Remember these things, O Jacob, O Israel, for thou art my servant! I formed thee; thou art my servant; O Israel, I will not forget thee. 
\v 22 I have caused thy transgressions to vanish like a cloud, And thy sins like a mist; Return to me, for I have redeemed thee! 
\v 23 Sing, O ye heavens, for Jehovah hath done it; Shout, O ye depths of the earth! Break forth into song, ye mountains! Thou forest, and every tree therein! For Jehovah hath redeemed Jacob, And glorified himself in Israel. 
\v 24 Thus saith Jehovah, thy Redeemer, Even he that formed thee from the womb; I am Jehovah, who made all things; Who stretched out the heavens alone; Who spread out the earth by myself; 
\v 25 Who frustrateth the signs of deceivers, And maketh the diviners mad; Who putteth the wise men to shame, And maketh their knowledge folly; 
\v 26 Who establisheth the word of his servant, And performeth the purpose of his messengers; Who saith of Jerusalem, “She shall be inhabited,” And of the cities of Judah, “They shall be built,” And, “Her desolated places I will restore.” 
\v 27 Who saith to the deep, “Be dry! I will dry up thy streams!” 
\v 28 Who saith of Cyrus, “He is my shepherd; He shall perform all my pleasure”; Who saith of Jerusalem, “She shall be built,” And of the temple, “Her foundation shall be laid.” 
\c 45  
\p
\v 1 Thus saith Jehovah to his anointed, To Cyrus, whom I hold by his right hand, To subdue nations before him, And ungird the loins of kings; To open before him the two-leaved gates, And the doors shall not be shut. 
\v 2 I will go before thee, And make the high places plain; I will break in pieces the gates of brass, And cut in sunder the bars of iron. 
\v 3 I will give thee the treasures of darkness, And hidden riches of secret places, That thou mayst know that I am Jehovah Who calleth thee by name, the God of Israel. 
\v 4 For the sake of Jacob, my servant, And Israel, my chosen, I have called thee by thy name; I have spoken to thee as a friend, though thou hast not known me. 
\v 5 I am Jehovah, and none else; There is no God besides me; I have girded thee, though thou hast not known me. 
\v 6 That men may know from the rising of the sun, And from the West, that there is none besides me; I am Jehovah, and none else. 
\v 7 I form the light, and create darkness; I make peace, and create evil; I, Jehovah, do all these things. 
\v 8 Pour forth, ye heavens, from above; Ye clouds, shower down prosperity! Let the earth open, and bring forth salvation; Yea, let righteousness spring up together! I, Jehovah, create it. 
\v 9 Woe to him that contendeth with his Maker! A potsherd of the potsherds of the earth! Shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it, What makest thou? Or thy work say of thee, He hath no hands? 
\v 10 Woe to him that saith to his father, Why dost thou beget? Or to his mother, Why dost thou bring forth? 
\v 11 Thus saith Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker, Ask of me concerning things to come; My children, the work of my hands, leave them to me! 
\v 12 I made the earth, And created man upon it; My hands spread out the heavens, And all their host did I arrange. 
\v 13 I have raised him up for salvation, And I will make all his ways plain; He shall build my city, and release my captives, Not for price, and not for ransom, Saith Jehovah of hosts. 
\v 14 Thus saith Jehovah: The wealth of Egypt and the merchandise of the Ethiopians and Sabeans, men of stature, Shall come over to thee, and be thine; They shall follow thee; in chains shall they pass along; They shall fall down to thee, and make supplication to thee: “In thee alone is God, and there is none else; There is no other God.” 
\v 15 Truly thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the saviour! 
\v 16 They shall all be ashamed and confounded, They shall go to confusion together, That are makers of idols. 
\v 17 But Israel shall be saved by Jehovah with an everlasting salvation; Ye shall never be ashamed, nor confounded. 
\v 18 For thus saith Jehovah, who created the heavens; The God that formed the earth and made it; he that made it firm; He created it not in vain; he formed it to be inhabited: I am Jehovah, and none else. 
\v 19 I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth; I have not said to the race of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain! I, Jehovah, speak truth; I declare that which is right. 
\v 20 Assemble yourselves and come; Gather yourselves together, ye that are escaped of the nations! They are without understanding, who carry about with them the wood of their graven image, And pray to a god that cannot save. 
\v 21 Proclaim ye, and bring them near, And let them take counsel together: Who hath made this known from ancient time? Who hath declared it of old? Is it not I, Jehovah, besides whom there is no God? A God that uttereth truth, and giveth salvation; there is none besides me. 
\v 22 Look to me, and be saved, all ye ends of the earth! For I am God, and there is none else. 
\v 23 By myself have I sworn, The truth hath gone from my mouth, The word, that shall not return, That to me every knee shall bow, That to me every tongue shall swear. 
\v 24 “Only in Jehovah,” shall men say, “Is salvation and strength; To him shall come and be put to shame, All that are incensed against him.” 
\v 25 Through Jehovah shall all the race of Israel be delivered, And in him shall they glory. 
\c 46  
\p
\v 1 Bel sinketh down; Nebo falleth; Their images are laid upon beasts and cattle; Those that ye once bore are packed upon them; A burden to the weary beast! 
\v 2 They sink down; they fall together; They cannot rescue the burden; They themselves go into captivity. 
\v 3 Hearken to me, O house of Jacob, And all the remnant of the house of Israel; Ye that have been borne by me from your birth, That have been carried by me from your earliest breath! 
\v 4 Even to your old age I am the same; Even to hoar hairs I will carry you; I have done it, and I will still bear you; I will carry, and will deliver you. 
\v 5 To whom will ye liken me, and compare me? Yea, to whom will ye compare me, that we may be like? 
\v 6 They lavish gold out of the bag, And weigh silver in the balance; They hire a goldsmith, and he maketh it a god; They fall down, yea, they worship it. 
\v 7 They lift him upon the shoulder, and carry him; They set him in his place, and there he standeth; From his place he moveth not; Yea, one may cry to him, yet doth he not answer, Nor save him out of his distress. 
\v 8 Remember these things, and show yourselves men; Lay them to heart, ye apostates! 
\v 9 Remember the former things in ancient times! For I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like me. 
\v 10 Declaring the end from the beginning; From ancient times the things that were not yet done; Saying, My purpose shall stand, And I will do all my pleasure; 
\v 11 Calling from the East the eagle, The man that executeth my purpose from a far country; I have spoken it, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also do it. 
\v 12 Hearken to me, ye stubborn-hearted, That are far from deliverance! 
\v 13 I have brought near my deliverance; it is not far off; My salvation shall not tarry; I will give to Zion salvation, To Israel, my glory. 
\c 47  
\p
\v 1 Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin, daughter of Babylon! Sit on the ground without a throne, O daughter of the Chaldaeans! For thou shalt no longer be called the tender and delicate! 
\v 2 Take the mill-stones and grind meal; Raise thy veil, lift up thy train; Make bare the leg, wade through the streams! 
\v 3 Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, And thy shame shall be seen. I will take vengeance; I will make peace with none. 
\v 4 Our Redeemer, Jehovah of hosts is his name, The Holy One of Israel. 
\v 5 Sit thou in silence; go into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldaeans! For thou shalt no more be called the mistress of kingdoms. 
\v 6 I was angry with my people; I profaned my inheritance, And gave them into thy hand; Thou didst show them no mercy; Even upon the aged didst thou lay a very grievous yoke. 
\v 7 Thou saidst, “I shall be mistress forever”; So that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart, Nor consider what would be the end of them. 
\v 8 But hear thou this, thou that art given to pleasure! That sittest in security, And sayest in thy heart, “I am, and there is none besides me; I shall not be a widow, Nor see myself childless!” 
\v 9 Behold, both these things shall come upon thee suddenly, in one day, Loss of children, and widowhood; In full measure shall they come upon thee, In spite of thy many sorceries, And the great abundance of thy enchantments. 
\v 10 Thou didst trust in thy wickedness, and saidst, “No one seeth me”; Thy wisdom and thy knowledge have led thee astray; Thou saidst in thy heart, “I am, and there is none besides me”; 
\v 11 Therefore shall evil come upon thee, of which thou shalt not know the dawn; And mischief shall fall upon thee, which thou shalt not be able to expiate; Suddenly shall desolation come upon thee, when thou thinkest not of it. 
\v 12 Persevere now in thy enchantments; In the multitude of thy sorceries, in which thou hast labored from thy youth; Perhaps thou mayst be profited by them! Perhaps thou mayst make thyself feared! 
\v 13 Art thou wearied with thy many devices? Let them stand up, then, and save thee, The observers of the heavens, the star-gazers, They that prognosticate at every new moon The things that shall come upon thee! 
\v 14 Behold, they shall be like stubble; the fire shall burn them up; They shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame; Not a coal shall be left of them to warm one, Nor a spark of fire to sit by. 
\v 15 Thus shall it be with them with whom thou hast labored; Thus with them with whom thou hast trafficked from thy youth; They shall go every one his own way; None shall help thee. 
\c 48  
\p
\v 1 Hear this, O house of Jacob! Ye that are called by the name of Israel; Ye that have come forth from the fountain of Judah; Ye that swear by the name of Jehovah, And praise the God of Israel, But not in truth and sincerity! 
\v 2 For they call themselves of the holy city, And stay themselves on the God of Israel, Whose name is Jehovah of hosts:— 
\v 3 What hath happened I declared to you long ago; From my mouth it proceeded, and I made it known; On a sudden I effected it, and it came to pass. 
\v 4 Because I knew that thou art obstinate, And that thy neck is a bar of iron, And that thy brow is brass, 
\v 5 I declared it to thee long ago; Before it came to pass, I made it known to thee; Lest thou shouldst say, My idol effected it, And my graven image, and my molten image ordained it. 
\v 6 Thou hast heard it; now see it all! And will ye not confess it? From this time I make you hear a new thing, Even a hidden thing, which thou hast not known. 
\v 7 It is produced now, and not long ago; Before this day thou hast not heard of it, Lest thou shouldst say, Behold, I knew it. 
\v 8 Yea, thou heardest it not; yea, thou knewest it not; Yea, it was not disclosed to thee long ago; For I knew that thou wast wholly faithless, And wast called rebellious from thy birth. 
\v 9 For the sake of my name I will defer my anger, And for the sake of my praise I will restrain it from thee, That I may not utterly cut thee off. 
\v 10 Behold, I have melted thee, and found no silver; I have tried thee in the furnace of affliction. 
\v 11 For mine own sake will I do it; For how would my name be blasphemed? And my glory will I not give to another. 
\v 12 Hearken to me, O Jacob, And Israel, whom I have called! I am He, I am the first, and I the last. 
\v 13 Yea, my hand hath founded the earth, And my right hand hath spread out the heavens; I called them; they stood forth together. 
\v 14 Assemble yourselves, all of you, and hear! Who among you hath declared these things? He whom Jehovah loveth will execute his pleasure upon Babylon, And his power upon the Chaldaeans. 
\v 15 I, even I, have spoken; yea, I have called him; I have brought him, and his way shall be prosperous. 
\v 16 Draw near to me, and hear ye this! I spake not in secret from the beginning; And since it began to be, I have been there; And now hath the Lord Jehovah sent me with his spirit. 
\v 17 Thus saith Jehovah, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I am Jehovah, thy God, who teacheth thee what will profit thee; Who leadeth thee in the way thou shouldst go. 
\v 18 O that thou wouldst hearken to my commandments! Then shall thy peace be as a river, And thy prosperity as the waves of the sea; 
\v 19 Then shall thy posterity be as the sand, And the fruit of thy body as the offspring of the sea; Thy name shall not be cut off, nor destroyed before me. 
\v 20 Come ye forth from Babylon, flee ye from the land of the Chaldaeans with the voice of joy! Publish ye this, and make it known; Let it resound to the ends of the earth! Say: “Jehovah hath redeemed his servant Jacob; 
\v 21 They thirst not in the deserts through which he leadeth them; Waters from the rock he causeth to flow for them; He cleaveth the rock, and the waters gush forth. 
\v 22 There is no peace, saith Jehovah, for the wicked.” 
\c 49  
\p
\v 1 Listen to me, ye distant lands! Attend, ye nations from afar! Jehovah called me at my birth; In my very childhood he called me by name. 
\v 2 He made my mouth like a sharp sword; In the shadow of his hand did he hide me. He made me a polished shaft; In his quiver did he hide me. 
\v 3 He said to me, Thou art my servant; Israel, in whom I will be glorified. 
\v 4 Then I said, I have labored in vain; For naught, for vanity, have I spent my strength; Yet my cause is with Jehovah, And my reward with my God. 
\v 5 And now thus saith Jehovah, Who formed me from my birth to be his servant To bring Jacob to him again, And that Israel might be gathered to him,—For I am honored in the eyes of Jehovah, And my God is my strength,— 
\v 6 He said, It is a small tiling that thou shouldst be my servant, To raise up the tribes of Jacob, And to restore the preserved of Israel; I will also make thee the light of the nations, That my salvation may reach the ends of the earth. 
\v 7 Thus saith Jehovah, the Redeemer of Israel, his Holy One, To him that is despised by men, abhorred by the people, To the servant of tyrants; Kings shall see, and stand up, Princes, and they shall pay homage, On account of Jehovah, who is faithful, The Holy One of Israel, who hath chosen thee. 
\v 8 Thus saith Jehovah; In the time of favor will I hear thee; In the day of deliverance will I help thee; I will preserve thee, and make thee a mediator for the people, To restore the land, to distribute the desolated inheritances; 
\v 9 To say to the prisoners, Go forth! To them that are in darkness, Come to the light! They shall feed in the ways, And on all high places shall be their pasture. 
\v 10 They shall not hunger, neither shall they thirst; Neither shall the heat nor the sun smite them; For he that hath compassion on them shall lead them; To springs of water shall he guide them. 
\v 11 And I will make all my mountains a highway; And my roads shall be prepared. 
\v 12 Behold! these shall come from far; And behold! these from the North and from the West, And these from the land of Sinim. 
\v 13 Sing, O ye heavens, and rejoice, O earth! Break forth into singing, ye mountains! For Jehovah comforteth his people, And hath compassion on his afflicted ones. 
\v 14 Zion saith, “Jehovah hath forsaken me; The Lord hath forgotten me.” 
\v 15 Can a woman forget her sucking child, So as not to have compassion on the son of her womb? Yet, should they forget, I will never forget thee! 
\v 16 Behold, I have graven thee on the palms of my hands; Thy walls are ever before my eyes. 
\v 17 Thy children shall make haste; They that destroyed and laid thee waste shall depart from thee. 
\v 18 Lift up thine eyes around, and see! They all assemble themselves, and come to thee. As I live, saith Jehovah, Thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all, as with a rich dress; Thou shalt bind them on thee, as a bride her jewels. 
\v 19 For thy waste and desolate places, and thy land laid in ruins, Shall now be too narrow for the inhabitants; And they that devoured thee shall be far away. 
\v 20 Thou, that hast been childless, shalt yet hear thy sons exclaim: “The place is too narrow for me; make room for me that I may dwell.” 
\v 21 And thou shalt say in thy heart, Who hath begotten me these? I surely was childless and unfruitful, An exile, and an outcast; who then hath brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, then, where were they? 
\v 22 Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will lift up my hand to the nations, And set up my standard to the kingdoms; They shall bring thy sons in their arms, And thy daughters upon their shoulders. 
\v 23 And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, And queens thy nursing mothers; Upon their faces shall they bow down before thee, And lick the dust of thy feet. Thus shalt thou know that I am Jehovah; And they who trust in me shall not be put to shame. 
\v 24 Shall the prey be taken away from the mighty? Or shall the spoil of the terrible be rescued? 
\v 25 Yea, thus saith Jehovah, The prey shall be taken away from the mighty, And the spoil of the terrible shall be rescued; For with him that contendeth with thee will I contend, (49:26) And I will save thy children. 
\v 26 (49:27) And I will cause thine oppressors to eat their own flesh; With their own blood shall they be drunk, as with new wine; And all flesh shall know that I Jehovah am thy saviour; That thy redeemer is the Mighty One of Jacob. 
\c 50  
\p
\v 1 Thus saith Jehovah: Where is the bill of your mother's divorcement, By which I dismissed her? Or who is he among my creditors To whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities are ye sold, And for your transgressions was your mother dismissed. 
\v 2 Wherefore, when I came, was no man at hand? When I called, was there none to answer? Is my hand too short to redeem? Or have I no power to deliver? Behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, And make the rivers a desert. Their fish putrefy for want of water, And die with thirst. 
\v 3 I clothe the heavens with blackness, And make sackcloth their covering. 
\v 4 The Lord Jehovah hath given me the tongue of the learned, That I might know how to strengthen with my words them that are weary; He wakeneth me every morning, He wakeneth mine ear, That I may hear in the manner of the learned. 
\v 5 The Lord Jehovah opened mine ear, And I was not disobedient, Neither did I withdraw myself backward. 
\v 6 I gave my back to the smiters, And my cheeks to them that pluck the beard; I hid not my face from shame and spitting. 
\v 7 But the Lord Jehovah is my helper, Therefore shall I not be confounded; Therefore have I made my face like a flint, For I know that I shall not be put to shame. 
\v 8 He that defendeth my cause is near; Who will contend with me? Let us stand up together! Who is my adversary? Let him come near to me! 
\v 9 Behold, the Lord Jehovah is my defender; Who is he that shall condemn me? Behold, they shall all waste away like a garment; The moth shall consume them. 
\v 10 Who is there among you that feareth Jehovah, That hearkeneth to the voice of his servant, That walketh in darkness and hath no light? Let him trust in the name of Jehovah, And lean upon his God. 
\v 11 Behold, all ye who kindle a fire, Who gird yourselves with burning arrows! Walk ye in the light of your fire, And in the burning arrows which ye have kindled. This shall ye have from my hand; Ye shall lie down in sorrow. 
\c 51  
\p
\v 1 Hearken to me, ye that pursue righteousness. Ye that seek Jehovah! Look to the rock whence ye were hewn, To the pit-quarry whence ye were digged! 
\v 2 Look to Abraham your father, And to Sarah that bore you! For I called him when only one, And blessed him, and multiplied him. 
\v 3 Thus will Jehovah have pity upon Zion; He will have pity upon all her desolations. He will make her wilderness like Eden, Her desert like the garden of Jehovah. Joy and gladness shall be found therein; Thanksgiving, and the voice of melody. 
\v 4 Hearken to me, O my people! And give ear to me, O my nation! For a law shall proceed from me, And I will establish my statutes for the light of the nations. 
\v 5 My help is near; my salvation goeth forth; My arm shall judge the nations; Distant lands shall wait for me, And in my arm shall they trust. 
\v 6 Lift up your eyes to the heavens, And look down upon the earth beneath! For the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, And the earth shall decay like a garment, And its inhabitants shall perish like flies. But my salvation shall endure forever, And my goodness shall not decay. 
\v 7 Hearken to me, ye that know righteousness, The people in whose heart is my law! Fear ye not the reproach of men, Nor be disheartened by their revilings! 
\v 8 For the moth shall consume them like a garment, And the worm shall eat them like wool. But my goodness shall endure forever, And my salvation from generation to generation. 
\v 9 Awake! awake! clothe thyself with strength, O arm of Jehovah! Awake, as in the ancient days, in the generations of old! 
\v 10 Art thou not the same that smote Rahab, And wounded the dragon? Art thou not the same that dried up the sea, The waters of the great deep,—That made the depths of the sea a path for the redeemed to pass through? 
\v 11 Thus shall the ransomed of Jehovah return; They shall come to Zion with singing; Everlasting joy shall be upon their heads; They shall obtain gladness and joy, And sorrow and sighing shall flee away. 
\v 12 I, even I, am he that hath pity upon you; Who art thou, that thou art afraid of man, that shall die, Of the son of man, that shall perish like grass, 
\v 13 And forgettest Jehovah thy maker, That stretched out the heavens, And founded the earth, And fearest continually every day, On account of the fury of the oppressor, As if he were taking aim to destroy thee? Where now is the fury of the oppressor? 
\v 14 Soon shall the enchained be loosed; He shall not die in the pit, Nor shall his bread fail. 
\v 15 For I am Jehovah thy God, That rebuketh the sea when his waves roar; Jehovah of hosts is his name. 
\v 16 I have put my words into thy mouth, And have covered thee with the shadow of my hand, To establish the heavens, and to found the earth. And to say to Zion, “Thou art my people!” 
\v 17 Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem! Thou that hast drunk from the hand of Jehovah the cup of his fury, Thou that hast drunk to the dregs the cup of giddiness! 
\v 18 There is not one to lead her, of all the sons which she hath brought forth, Nor is there one to take her by the hand, of all the sons which she hath nurtured. 
\v 19 These two things have come upon thee, And who bemoaneth thee? Desolation and destruction, and famine and the sword; How shall I comfort thee? 
\v 20 Thy sons have fainted; they lie at the head of all the streets, Like a deer in the net; They are full of the wrath of Jehovah, Of the rebuke of thy God. 
\v 21 Therefore, hear this, thou afflicted, Thou drunken, and not with wine! 
\v 22 Thus saith thy Lord, Jehovah, And thy God, that defendeth the cause of his people. Behold, I will take from thy hand the cup of giddiness, The cup of my wrath; Thou shalt drink no more of it. 
\v 23 And I will put it into the hand of them that have afflicted thee; That have said to thee, “Bow down, that we may pass over!” And thou madest thy body as the ground, And as the street, to them that passed over. 
\c 52  
\p
\v 1 Awake, awake, put on thy majesty, O Zion! Put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city! For no more shall come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean. 
\v 2 Shake thyself from the dust, Arise and sit erect, O Jerusalem! Loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion! 
\v 3 For thus saith Jehovah: For naught were ye sold, And without money shall ye be ransomed. 
\v 4 For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: My people went down to Egypt formerly to sojourn there, And the Assyrian oppressed them without cause. 
\v 5 And now, what have I here to do, saith the Lord, When my people is taken away for naught, And their tyrants exult, saith Jehovah, And all the day long my name is blasphemed. 
\v 6 Therefore shall my people know my name; Therefore in that day shall they know That I am he that said, Behold, here am I! 
\v 7 How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, of him that proclaimeth peace! That bringeth good tidings, that proclaimeth salvation! That saith to Zion, “Thy God is king!” 
\v 8 Hark! the voice of thy watchmen! They lift up the voice together; yea, they shout! For eye to eye shall they behold, When Jehovah returneth to Zion. 
\v 9 Break forth into joy; shout together, ye ruins of Jerusalem! For Jehovah hath pity on his people; he redeemeth Jerusalem. 
\v 10 Jehovah maketh bare his holy arm In the sight of all the nations; All the ends of the earth Behold the salvation from our God. 
\v 11 Depart, depart ye; go ye out from thence; Touch no unclean thing! Go ye out from the midst of her; Be ye clean, ye that bear the vessels of Jehovah! 
\v 12 For not in haste shall ye go forth, Nor in flight shall ye pass along; For Jehovah shall march in your front, And the God of Israel bring up your rear. 
\v 13 Behold, my servant shall prosper; He shall be lifted up, and set on high, and greatly exalted. 
\v 14 As many were amazed at the sight of him,—So disfigured and scarcely human was his visage, And so unlike that of a man was his form,— 
\v 15 So shall he cause many nations to exult on account of him; Kings shall shut their mouths before him. For what had never been told them shall they see, And what they never heard shall they perceive. 
\c 53  
\p
\v 1 Who hath believed our report, And to whom hath the arm of Jehovah been revealed? 
\v 2 For He grew up before him like a tender plant, Like a sucker from a dry soil; He had no form, nor comeliness, that we should look upon him, Nor beauty, that we should take pleasure in him. 
\v 3 He was despised, and forsaken of men, A man of sorrows, and acquainted with disease; As one from whom men hide their faces, He was despised, and we esteemed him not. 
\v 4 But he bore our diseases, And carried our pains, And we esteemed him stricken from above, Smitten of God, and afflicted. 
\v 5 But he was wounded for our transgressions; He was bruised for our iniquities; For our peace was the chastisement upon him, And by his stripes are we healed. 
\v 6 All we, like sheep, were going astray; We turned every one to his own way, And Jehovah laid upon him the iniquity of us all. 
\v 7 He was oppressed, that was already afflicted. Yet he opened not his mouth; As a lamb that is led to the slaughter, And as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, He opened not his mouth. 
\v 8 By oppression and punishment he was taken away, And who in his generation would consider That he was cut off from the land of the living, That for the transgression of my people he was smitten? 
\v 9 His grave was appointed with the wicked, And with the rich man was his sepulchre, Although he had done no injustice, And there was no deceit in his mouth. 
\v 10 It pleased Jehovah severely to bruise him; But when he hath made his life a sacrifice for sin, He shall see posterity; he shall prolong his days, And the pleasure of Jehovah shall prosper in his hand. 
\v 11 Free from his sorrows, he shall see and be satisfied; By his knowledge shall my righteous servant lead many to righteousness, And he shall bear their iniquities. 
\v 12 Therefore will I give him his portion with the mighty, And with heroes shall he divide the spoil, Because he poured out his soul unto death, And was numbered with transgressors; Because he bore the sin of many, And made intercession for transgressors. 
\c 54  
\p
\v 1 Sing, O thou barren, that didst not hear! Break forth into singing, and shout for joy, thou that wast not in travail! For more are the children of the desolate Than of the married woman, saith Jehovah. 
\v 2 Enlarge the place of thy tent, And let the canopy of thy habitation be extended! Spare not; lengthen thy cords, And make fast thy stakes! 
\v 3 For on the right hand and on the left shalt thou burst forth with increase; And thy posterity shall inherit the nations, And people the desolate cities. 
\v 4 Fear not, for thou shalt not be confounded; Blush not, for thou shalt not be put to shame. For thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, And the reproach of thy widowhood thou shalt remember no more. 
\v 5 For thy husband is thy Maker; Jehovah of hosts is his name. Thy redeemer is the Holy One of Israel; The God of the whole earth shall he be called. 
\v 6 For as a woman forsaken, and deeply afflicted, hath Jehovah recalled thee, And as a wife wedded in youth, that hath been rejected, saith thy God. 
\v 7 For a little moment I have forsaken thee, But with great mercy will I gather thee. 
\v 8 In overflowing wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment. But with everlasting kindness will I have mercy upon thee, Saith thy redeemer, Jehovah. 
\v 9 As in the time of the waters of Noah, so shall it be now; As I swore that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth, So do I swear that I will not be angry with thee, nor rebuke thee. 
\v 10 For the mountains shall depart, And the hills be overthrown, But my kindness shall not depart from thee, Nor shall my covenant of peace be overthrown, Saith Jehovah, that hath pity on thee. 
\v 11 O thou afflicted, beaten with the storm, destitute of consolation! Behold, I lay thy stones in cement of vermilion, And thy foundations with sapphires. 
\v 12 And I will make thy battlements of rubies, And thy gates of carbuncles, And all thy borders fill of precious stones. 
\v 13 All thy children shall be taught by Jehovah, And great shall be the prosperity of thy children. 
\v 14 By righteousness shalt thou be established; Be thou far from anxiety, for thou shalt have nothing to fear, And from terror, for it shall not come near thee. 
\v 15 If any be leagued against thee, it is not by my command; Whoever shall be leagued against thee shall come over to thee. 
\v 16 Behold, I create the smith, Who bloweth up the coals into a fire, And produceth an instrument for his work; I also create the destroyer to lay waste. 
\v 17 Whatever weapon is formed against thee, it shall not prosper; And against every tongue that contendeth with thee, thou shalt obtain thy cause. This is the inheritance of the servants of Jehovah, And the blessing which they receive from me, saith Jehovah. 
\c 55  
\p
\v 1 Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters! Even ye that have no money, come ye, buy and eat! Yea, come, buy wine and milk, Without money and without price. 
\v 2 Wherefore do ye spend your money for that which is not bread, And your substance for that which doth not satisfy? Listen attentively to me; so shall ye eat that which is good, And your soul shall delight itself with delicacies. 
\v 3 Incline your ear, and come to me; Hear, and your soul shall live! And I will make with you an everlasting covenant; I will give you the sure mercies of David. 
\v 4 Behold, I gave him for a commander to the nations; For a prince, and a lawgiver to the nations. 
\v 5 Behold, the nation which thou knowest not thou shalt call; And the nation which knew not thee shall run to thee, For the sake of Jehovah, thy God, And of the Holy One of Israel, for he hath glorified thee. 
\v 6 Seek ye Jehovah, while he may be found; Call upon him while he is near; 
\v 7 Let the wicked forsake his way, And the unrighteous man his thoughts; Let him return to Jehovah, and he will have mercy upon him, And to our God, for he will abundantly pardon. 
\v 8 For my thoughts are not your thoughts, Neither are your ways my ways, saith Jehovah. 
\v 9 For as the heavens are higher than the earth, So are my ways higher than your ways, And my thoughts than your thoughts. 
\v 10 For as the rain and the snow descend from heaven, And return not thither, But water the earth, and make it bear and put forth its increase, That it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater; 
\v 11 So shall my word be, that goeth forth from my mouth; It shall not return to me void; But it shall bring to pass that which is my pleasure, And it shall accomplish that for which I send it. 
\v 12 For ye shall go out with joy And be led forth with peace; The mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, And all the trees of the field shall clap their hands. 
\v 13 Instead of the thorn shall grow up the cypress-tree, And instead of the bramble shall grow up the myrtle-tree, And it shall be to Jehovah for a name; For an everlasting memorial, that shall not pass away. 
\c 56  
\p
\v 1 Thus saith Jehovah: Keep ye justice, and practise righteousness; For the coming of my salvation is near, And my deliverance is soon to be revealed. 
\v 2 Happy the man that doeth this, And the son of man that holdeth it fast; That keepeth the sabbath, and profaneth it not, And restraineth his hand from doing evil. 
\v 3 And let not the stranger that joineth himself to Jehovah say, Jehovah hath wholly separated me from his people. And let not the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree! 
\v 4 For thus saith Jehovah concerning the eunuchs: They that keep my sabbaths, And take pleasure in doing my will, And hold fast my covenant, 
\v 5 To them will I give in my house, and within my walls, a portion and a name, Better than of sons and daughters; An everlasting name will I give them, That shall never fade away. 
\v 6 The strangers, also, that join themselves to Jehovah, to serve him, To love the name of Jehovah, and to be his servants. Every one that keepeth the sabbath, and profaneth it not, And holdeth fast my covenant, 
\v 7 Them will I bring to my holy mountain, And I will make them rejoice in my house of prayer; Their burnt-offerings and sacrifices shall be accepted on mine altar; For my house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations. 
\v 8 Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, That gathereth the outcasts of Israel; Yet will I gather others to him, Besides those that are already gathered. 
\v 9 Come, all ye beasts of the field, Yea, all ye beasts of the forest, to devour! 
\v 10 His watchmen are all blind; they know nothing; They are all dumb dogs, that cannot bark, Dreaming, lying down, loving to slumber; 
\v 11 Yet are they greedy dogs that cannot be satisfied; The shepherds themselves will not attend; They all turn aside to their own way, Every one of them to their own gain. 
\v 12 “Come on, let me bring wine, And let us fill ourselves with strong drink, And to-morrow shall be as to-day, And even much more abundant.” 
\c 57  
\p
\v 1 The righteous man perisheth, and no one layeth it to heart; And pious men are taken away, and none considereth That because of the evil the righteous man is taken away. 
\v 2 He entereth into peace; He resteth in his bed, Every one that walketh in uprightness. 
\v 3 But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, Ye brood of the adulterer and the harlot! 
\v 4 Of whom do ye make your sport, And at whom do ye make wide the mouth, And draw out the tongue? Are ye not rebellious children, a treacherous brood? 
\v 5 Burning with lust for idols Under every green tree, Slaying children in the valleys, Under the clefts of the rocks? 
\v 6 With the smooth stones of the valley is thy portion; These, these are thy lot; Here thou pourest out thy drink-offering, And presentest thy meat-offering; Can I see such things, and be at rest? 
\v 7 Upon a high and lofty mountain settest thou thy bed; Thither dost thou go up to offer sacrifice; 
\v 8 Behind the doors and the posts dost thou place thy memorial; Thou departest from me, and uncoverest, and ascendest, and enlargest thy bed. Thou makest an agreement with them; Thou desirest their bed; Thou choosest a place. 
\v 9 Thou goest to the king with oil, And takest much precious perfume; Thou sendest thine ambassadors afar, Yea, down to the under-world. 
\v 10 In the length of thy journeys thou hast wearied thyself, But thou sayest not, “I will desist”; Thou yet findest life in thy hand, Therefore thou art not discouraged. 
\v 11 On account of whom art thou anxious, and of whom art thou afraid, that thou hast proved false, And hast not remembered me, nor laid it to heart? Behold, I have been silent a long time; Therefore thou fearest me not. 
\v 12 But now I announce thy deliverance, And thy works do not profit thee. 
\v 13 When thou criest, let thy host of idols deliver thee! But the wind shall bear them all away; A breath shall take them off; But he that putteth his trust in me Shall possess the land, And shall inherit my holy mountain. 
\v 14 Men shall say, Cast up, cast up, prepare the road; Remove every obstruction from the way of my people! 
\v 15 For thus saith the high and lofty One That inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy: I dwell in the high and holy place; With him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit; To revive the spirit of the humble, And to revive the heart of the contrite ones. 
\v 16 For I will not contend forever, Nor will I be always angry; For life would fail before me, And the souls which I created. 
\v 17 For the guilt of his covetousness I was angry; I smote him, I hid myself, and was angry; But yet he went on perversely in the way of his heart. 
\v 18 I have seen his ways, yet will I heal him; I will guide him, and I will restore comfort To him and to his mourners; 
\v 19 I create the fruit of the lips. Peace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is nigh, Saith Jehovah; I will heal him. 
\v 20 But the wicked is like the troubled sea, Which cannot rest, Whose waters cast up mire and dirt. 
\v 21 There is no peace, saith my God, for the wicked. 
\c 58  
\p
\v 1 Cry aloud, spare not, Lift up thy voice like a trumpet, And show my people their transgression, And the house of Jacob their sins! 
\v 2 Yet they seek me daily, And desire to know my ways, As a nation that hath done righteousness, And hath not forsaken the ordinances of their God; They inquire of me concerning the judgments which bring salvation; They long for the coming of God. 
\v 3 “Wherefore do we fast, and thou seest not? Wherefore do we afflict our souls, and thou dost not regard it?” Behold, in the day of your fasts ye pursue your pleasure, And exact all your labors. 
\v 4 Behold, ye fast in strife and contention, And smiting with the fist of wickedness. Ye do not fast now So that your voice shall be heard on high. 
\v 5 Is this the fast that I approve, A day for a man to afflict his soul? Is it that he should bow down his head like a bulrush, And lie down in sackcloth and ashes? Wilt thou call this a fast, And a day acceptable to Jehovah? 
\v 6 Is not this the fast that I approve,—To loose the bands of wickedness, To undo the heavy burdens, To let the oppressed go free, And to break in pieces every yoke? 
\v 7 Is it not to break thy bread to the hungry, And to bring the poor, that are cast out, to thy house? When thou seest the naked, that thou clothe him, And that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh? 
\v 8 Then shall thy light break forth like the morning, And thy health shall spring forth speedily; Thy salvation shall go before thee, And the glory of Jehovah shall bring up thy rear. 
\v 9 Then shalt thou call, and Jehovah will answer; Thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Lo, here I am! If thou remove from the midst of thee the yoke, The pointing of the finger, and the injurious speech. 
\v 10 If thou bring forth thy bread to the hungry, And satisfy the afflicted soul, Then in obscurity shall light arise to thee; Yea, thy darkness shall become as noonday; 
\v 11 Jehovah shall lead thee continually, And satisfy thee in the time of drought, And strengthen thy bones; Thou shalt be like a watered garden, and a spring of water, Whose waters never fail. 
\v 12 Thy people shall build the ancient desolations, The ruins of many generations shall they restore; Thou shalt be called the repairer of the breach, The restorer of ways for inhabitants. 
\v 13 If thou restrain thy foot from the sabbath, From doing thy pleasure on my holy day, If thou shalt call the sabbath a delight, The holy day of Jehovah honorable, And shalt honor it by refraining from thy work, From doing thy pleasure, and speaking vain words, 
\v 14 Then shalt thou delight thyself in Jehovah. And I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, And cause thee to enjoy the inheritance of Jacob, thy father; For the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken it. 
\c 59  
\p
\v 1 Behold, Jehovah's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save, Nor is his ear heavy, that it cannot hear; 
\v 2 But your iniquities have separated you from your God, And your sins have hidden his face from you, that he doth not hear. 
\v 3 For your hands are polluted with blood, And your fingers with iniquity; Your lips speak falsehood, And your tongue muttereth wickedness. 
\v 4 No one bringeth his suit with justice, And no one pleadeth with truth; They trust in vain words, and speak lies; They conceive mischief, and bring forth destruction. 
\v 5 They hatch the eggs of the basilisk, And weave the web of the spider; He that eateth of their eggs dieth, And when one of them is crushed, a viper breaketh forth. 
\v 6 Of their webs no garment is made, Nor can one cover himself with their work; Their works are works of iniquity, And the deed of violence is in their hands. 
\v 7 Their feet run to evil; They make haste to shed innocent blood. Their thoughts are evil thoughts; Oppression and destruction are in their paths. 
\v 8 The way of peace they know not, Nor is there any justice in their steps; They have made for themselves crooked paths; Whoso goeth in them knoweth not peace. 
\v 9 Therefore is judgment far from us, And deliverance doth not overtake us. We look for light, and behold obscurity; For brightness, and we walk in darkness. 
\v 10 We grope for the wall, like the blind; We feel our way, like those that are deprived of sight; We stumble at noonday as in the night; In the midst of fertile fields we are like the dead. 
\v 11 We groan, all of us, like bears, And like doves we make a continued moan; We look for judgment, and it cometh not; For salvation, and it is far from us. 
\v 12 For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, And our sins testify against us! For our transgressions are not hidden from us, And our iniquities we know. 
\v 13 We have rebelled, and proved false to Jehovah; We have departed from our God; We have spoken violence and rebellion; Our hearts have conceived and brought forth words of falsehood. 
\v 14 And justice is turned back, And equity standeth afar off, For truth falleth in the gate, And rectitude cannot enter. 
\v 15 Truth is not to be found, And he that departeth from evil is plundered; And Jehovah saw it, And it displeased him that there was no justice. 
\v 16 He saw that there was none to help, And wondered that there was none to interpose; Then his own arm wrought salvation for him, And his righteousness it supported him. 
\v 17 He put on righteousness as a breastplate, And the helmet of salvation upon his head; He put on garments of vengeance for his clothing, And clad himself with zeal, as with a mantle. 
\v 18 According to their deeds will he repay them,—Wrath to his adversaries, recompense to his enemies; To the distant coasts will he repay a recompense. 
\v 19 They in the west shall fear the name of Jehovah, And they in the rising of the sun his glory, When he cometh like a river straitened in its course, Which a strong wind driveth along. 
\v 20 Yet shall a redeemer come to Zion, For them that turn from their transgressions in Jacob, saith Jehovah. 
\v 21 And as for me, this is my covenant with them, saith Jehovah: My spirit, which is upon thee, And my words, which I have put in thy mouth, They shall not depart from thy mouth, Nor from the mouth of thy sons, Nor from the mouth of thy sons' sons, saith Jehovah, From this time forth forever.

\v 1 Arise, shine! for thy light is come, And the glory of Jehovah is risen upon thee. 
\v 2 For, behold, darkness shall cover the earth, And gross darkness the nations; But upon thee shall Jehovah arise, And his glory shall be seen upon thee. 
\v 3 Nations shall come to thy light, And kings to the brightness that riseth upon thee. 
\v 4 Lift up thine eyes round about and see! They all gather themselves together, and come to thee; Thy sons come from afar, And thy daughters are carried at thy side. 
\v 5 Then shalt thou see, and be bright with joy; Thy heart shall throb, and swell with delight, When the riches of the sea shall be turned toward thee, And the wealth of the nations shall come to thee. 
\v 6 A multitude of camels shall cover thee, Dromedaries from Midian and Ephah; From Sheba shall they all come. Gold and frankincense shall they bring, And proclaim the praises of Jehovah. 
\v 7 All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered to thee, And the rams of Nebaioth shall minister to thee; They shall ascend mine altar, an acceptable offering, And my glorious house I will adorn. 
\v 8 Who are these that fly like clouds, And like doves to their habitations? 
\v 9 Behold, the distant coasts shall wait for me, And the ships of Tarshish among the first, To bring thy sons from afar, And their silver and their gold with them, Because of the name of Jehovah thy God, Of the Holy One of Israel, for he glorifieth thee. 
\v 10 The sons of the stranger shall build up thy walls, And their kings shall minister to thee; For in my wrath I smote thee, But in my mercy will I have pity upon thee. 
\v 11 Thy gates shall be open continually; They shall not be shut by day or by night, That the treasures of the nations may be brought to thee, And that their kings may come with their retinues. 
\v 12 For that nation and that kingdom Which will not serve thee shall perish; Yea, those nations shall be utterly destroyed. 
\v 13 The glory of Lebanon shall come to thee, The cypress, the plane-tree, and the larch together, To adorn the place of my sanctuary, That I may make the place where my feet rest glorious. 
\v 14 The sons of thine oppressors shall come bending before thee; They that despised thee shall fall down at thy feet; And they shall call thee the city of Jehovah, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel. 
\v 15 Instead of being forsaken and hated, So that no one passed through thee, I will make thee an everlasting glory; The joy of many generations. 
\v 16 Thou shalt also suck the milk of the nations, And be nursed from the breast of kings; And thou shalt know that I, Jehovah, am thy saviour, That thy redeemer is the Mighty One of Jacob. 
\v 17 Instead of brass will I bring gold; And instead of iron will I bring silver, And instead of wood, brass, And instead of stones, iron; I will make thine officers peace, And thy magistrates righteousness. 
\v 18 Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, Wasting or destruction within thy borders; Thou shalt call thy walls Salvation, And thy gates Praise. 
\v 19 No more shall the sun be thy light by day, Nor with her brightness shall the moon enlighten thee: But Jehovah shall be to thee an everlasting light, And thy God thy glory. 
\v 20 Thy sun shall no more go down, Neither shall thy moon be hid; For Jehovah shall be thine everlasting light, And the days of thy mourning shall be ended. 
\v 21 Thy people shall be all righteous; Forever shall they possess the land, The scion of my planting, The work of my hands, that I may be glorified. 
\v 22 The little one shall become a thousand, And the small one a strong nation; I, Jehovah, will hasten it in its time. 
\c 61

\v 1 The spirit of the Lord Jehovah is upon me, For Jehovah hath anointed me; He hath sent me to publish good tidings to the distressed, To bind up the broken-hearted, To proclaim liberty to the captives, And the opening of the prison to them that are bound; 
\v 2 To proclaim the year of mercy from Jehovah, And the day of vengeance from our God; To comfort all that mourn; 
\v 3 To give gladness to the mourners in Zion; To give them a beautiful crown instead of ashes, The oil of joy for mourning, The garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness, So that they shall be called blessed terebinth-trees, The plantation of Jehovah for his glory. 
\v 4 They shall build up the old ruins; They shall raise up the ancient desolations; They shall repair the cities laid waste, The desolations of many generations. 
\v 5 Strangers shall stand up and feed your flocks, And the sons of the alien shall be your ploughmen and vine-dressers; 
\v 6 But ye shall be named the priests of Jehovah, Men shall call you the ministers of our God. Ye shall eat the riches of the nations, And in their glory shall ye make your boast. 
\v 7 For your shame shall ye have a double reward; And for ignominy ye shall rejoice in your portion; Therefore in your land ye shall possess double; Everlasting joy shall be your portion. 
\v 8 For I, Jehovah, love justice, I hate rapine and iniquity, I will give them their reward with faithfulness, And an everlasting covenant will I make with them. 
\v 9 Their race shall be illustrious among the nations, And their offspring among the people; All that see them shall acknowledge That they are a race which Jehovah hath blessed. 
\v 10 “I will greatly rejoice in Jehovah; My soul shall exult in my God; For he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation; He hath covered me with the mantle of deliverance. As the bridegroom decketh himself with his turban, And as the bride adorneth herself with her jewels.” 
\v 11 For as the earth putteth forth her shoots, And as a garden causeth its plants to spring forth, So shall the Lord Jehovah cause salvation to spring forth; And praise before all the nations. 
\c 62  
\p
\v 1 For Zion's sake I will not keep silence, And for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, Until her deliverance break forth like the shining light, And her salvation like a blazing torch. 
\v 2 Then shall the nations see thy prosperity, And all the kings thy glory; Thou shalt be called by a new name, Which the mouth of Jehovah shall give thee. 
\v 3 Thou shalt be a beautiful crown in the hand of Jehovah, A royal diadem in the hand of thy God. 
\v 4 No more shalt thou be called the Desolate, And thy land, the Forsaken. But thou shall be named My-delight-is-in-her. And thy land the wedded Matron. For Jehovah shall delight in thee, And thy land shall be married. 
\v 5 For as a young man weddeth a virgin. So shall thy children wed thee. And as a bridegroom rejoiceth in his bride, So shall thy God rejoice in thee. 
\v 6 Upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, have I set watchmen; All the day, and all the night, shall they not keep silence; O ye that praise Jehovah, keep not silence, 
\v 7 And give him no rest, Until he establish Jerusalem, and make her a praise in the earth! 
\v 8 Jehovah hath sworn by his right hand, and his mighty arm: No more will I give thy corn to be food for thine enemies, Nor shall the sons of the stranger drink thy wine, for which thou hast labored. 
\v 9 But they that reap the harvest shall eat it, And praise Jehovah; And they that gather the vintage shall drink it, In my holy comets. 
\v 10 Pass ye, pass ye through the gates; Prepare the way for the people; Cast ye up, cast ye up the highway, Clear it from the stones; Lift up on high a standard for the tribes! 
\v 11 Behold, Jehovah proclaimeth to the end of the earth: “Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy Deliverer cometh! Behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him!” 
\v 12 They shall be called, The holy people, The redeemed of Jehovah. And thou shalt be called, The Sought out, The Not forsaken City. 
\c 63

\v 1 Who is this that cometh from Edom? In scarlet garments from Bozrah? This that is glorious in his apparel, Proud in the greatness of his strength? I that proclaim deliverance, And am mighty to save. 
\v 2 Wherefore is thine apparel red, And thy garments like those of one that treadeth the wine-vat? 
\v 3 I have trodden the wine-vat alone, And of the nations there was none with me. And I trod them in mine anger, And I trampled them in my fury, So that their life-blood was sprinkled upon my garments. And I have stained all my apparel. 
\v 4 For the day of vengeance was in my heart, And the year of my deliverance was come. 
\v 5 And I looked, and there was none to help, And I wondered, that there was none to uphold; Therefore my own arm wrought salvation for me, And my fury, it sustained me. 
\v 6 I trod down the nations in my anger; I crushed them in my fury, And spilled their blood upon the ground. 
\v 7 I will celebrate the mercy of Jehovah, the glory of Jehovah, According to all that he hath done for us; His great goodness to the house of Israel, Which he hath bestowed on it in his tender mercy, and his great kindness. 
\v 8 He said, Truly they are my people; Children that will not be false; So he was their deliverer. 
\v 9 In all their straits they had no distress; An angel of his presence saved them; In his love and compassion he redeemed them, He took them up and bore them all the days of old. 
\v 10 But they rebelled, and grieved his holy spirit; Then did he change himself into their enemy; He himself fought against them. 
\v 11 Then remembered his people the ancient days, the days of Moses, [[saying,]] Where is he that brought them up from the sea with the shepherd of his flock? Where is he that put his holy spirit within him? 
\v 12 That caused his glorious arm to accompany the right hand of Moses, That divided the water before them, To make to himself an everlasting name? 
\v 13 That led them through the deep, As a horse through a desert, without stumbling? 
\v 14 As the herd descendeth into the valley, The spirit of Jehovah led them to rest. So didst thou lead thy people, To make for thyself a glorious name. 
\v 15 Look down from heaven, and behold from thy holy and glorious habitation! Where is thy zeal and thy might? Thy pity and compassion for me, are they restrained? 
\v 16 Thou, surely, art our father; Abraham is ignorant of us, And Israel knoweth us not. Thou, O Jehovah, art our father; Our deliverer wast thou of old. 
\v 17 Why, O Jehovah, dost thou suffer us to wander from thy ways, And harden our hearts against thy fear? Return, for thy servants' sake, The tribes of thine inheritance! 
\v 18 But a little while did thy holy people possess the land; Then our enemies trampled upon thy sanctuary. 
\v 19 It has been with us as if thou hadst never ruled over us, As if we had not been called by thy name. 
\c 64  
\p
\v 1 O that thou wouldst rend the heavens, and come down; That the mountains might tremble at thy presence, 
\v 2 As fire kindleth the dry stubble, As fire causeth water to boil, To make known thy name to thine adversaries, That the nations might tremble at thy presence; 
\v 3 As thou once didst wonderful things, which we looked not for, And camest down, so that the mountains trembled at thy presence. 
\v 4 For never have men heard, nor perceived by the ear, Nor hath eye seen, a God beside thee. Who doeth such things for those that trust in him. 
\v 5 Thou art the friend of those who joyfully do righteousness, Those who remember thee in thy ways. Behold, thou art angry, and we are punished; Long doth the punishment endure, before we are delivered. 
\v 6 We are all of us an unclean thing; Like a filthy garment is all our righteousness; We are all withered like a leaf, And our sins, like a storm, have blown us away. 
\v 7 There is none that calleth upon thy name, That stirreth himself up to cleave to thee; For thou hidest thy face from us, And lettest us perish by our iniquities. 
\v 8 But now, O Jehovah, thou art our father; We are the clay, and thou hast formed us; We are all of us the work of thy hands. 
\v 9 Be not wroth, O Jehovah, to the uttermost, Nor remember our iniquity forever! Behold, look upon us, we beseech thee, we are all thy people! 
\v 10 Thy holy cities have become a wilderness; Zion is become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation. 
\v 11 Our holy and glorious house, Where our fathers praised thee, Is burned with fire, And all our precious things are laid waste. 
\v 12 Wilt thou contain thyself at these things, O Jehovah, Wilt thou keep silence, and still grievously afflict us? 
\c 65  
\p
\v 1 I have heard those that made no supplication; I have been found by those who sought me not; I said, Here I am, here I am, To a people that called not upon my name. 
\v 2 I have spread out my hands all the day To a rebellious people, That walketh in an evil way, According to their own devices; 
\v 3 To a people that provoke me to my face continually; That sacrifice in gardens, And burn incense on tiles; 
\v 4 That sit in sepulchres, And lodge in caverns; That eat swine's flesh, And have broth of unclean things in their vessels; 
\v 5 Who yet say: Stand by thyself! come not near to me, For I am holier than thou! These are a smoke in my nose, A fire that burneth continually. 
\v 6 Behold, it stands recorded before me; I will not keep silence, but will requite; I will requite it into their bosoms; 
\v 7 Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith Jehovah, Who burnt incense on the mountains, And dishonored me on the hills, I will pour the full recompense of their former deeds into their bosom. 
\v 8 Thus saith Jehovah: As when juice is found in a cluster, Men say, “Destroy it not, for a blessing is in it”; So will I do, for the sake of my servants, and will not destroy the whole; 
\v 9 I will cause a stem to spring forth from Jacob, And from Judah a possessor of my mountains; My chosen shall possess the land, And my servants shall dwell there. 
\v 10 And Sharon shall be a fold for flocks, And the valley of Achor a resting-place for herds, For my people that have sought me. 
\v 11 But ye, who have forsaken Jehovah, And have forgotten my holy mountain, That prepare a table for Fortune, And fill the cup for Destiny, 
\v 12 Yourselves do I destine to the sword, And all of you shall bow down before the slaughter; Because I called, and ye answered not, I spake, and ye would not hear, But did that which is evil in my sight, And chose that in which I had no delight. 
\v 13 Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, my servants shall eat, and ye shall be hungry; Behold, my servants shall drink, and ye shall be thirsty; Behold, my servants shall rejoice, and ye shall be confounded; 
\v 14 Behold, my servants shall sing for gladness of heart, But ye shall shriek for sorrow of heart, And howl for anguish of spirit. 
\v 15 And ye shall leave your name for a curse to my chosen, And the Lord Jehovah shall slay you; But his servants will he call by another name. 
\v 16 Whoso blesseth himself in the land Shall bless by the true God; And he that sweareth in the land shall swear by the true God; For the former troubles are forgotten, And they are hid from mine eyes. 
\v 17 For behold! I create new heavens, and a new earth; The former ones shall not be remembered, Nor shall they be brought to mind any more. 
\v 18 But ye shall be glad and exult forever In that which I create; For behold! I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, And her people a joy. 
\v 19 And I will exult in Jerusalem, And rejoice in my people; No more shall be heard therein The voice of weeping and the cry of distress. 
\v 20 There shall not be there an infant child, nor an old man, That hath not filled the measure of his years; For he that dieth a hundred years old shall die a youth, And the sinner dying a hundred years old shall be held accursed. 
\v 21 They shall build houses, and inhabit them; They shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them; 
\v 22 They shall not build, and another inhabit; They shall not plant, and another eat; For as the days of a tree shall be the days of my people, Yea, long shall my chosen enjoy the work of their hands. 
\v 23 They shall not labor in vain, Nor bring forth children for early death; For they are a race blessed by Jehovah, And their offspring shall remain to them. 
\v 24 Before they call, I will answer; And while they are yet speaking, I will hear. 
\v 25 The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, And the lion shall eat straw like the ox, And dust shall be the food of the serpent. They shall not hurt, nor destroy, in all my holy mountain, Saith Jehovah. 
\c 66  
\p
\v 1 Thus saith Jehovah: Heaven is my throne, And the earth my footstool; Where is the house that ye can build me, And where is the place of my rest? 
\v 2 For all these things hath my hand made; By it do all these things exist, saith Jehovah. But to this man will I look, Even to him who is humble and of a contrite spirit, And who trembleth at my word. 
\v 3 He that slayeth an ox killeth a man; He that sacrificeth a lamb beheadeth a dog; He that maketh an oblation offereth swine's blood; He that burneth incense blesseth an idol. Yea, they have chosen their own ways, And in their abominations their souls delight. 
\v 4 I also will choose their calamities; What they dread I will bring upon them; Because I called, and no one answered, I spake, and they did not hear; But they did what is evil in my sight, And chose that in which I have no delight. 
\v 5 Hear the word of Jehovah, Ye that tremble at his word! “Your brethren that hate you, And thrust you out for my name's sake, have said, “May Jehovah be glorified, that we may see your joy!” But they shall be confounded. 
\v 6 A voice of tumult from the city! A voice from the temple! The voice of Jehovah, rendering recompense to his enemies! 
\v 7 Before she was in travail, she brought forth, Before her pangs came, she was delivered of a son. 
\v 8 Who hath heard such a thing? Who hath seen such things? Is a country brought forth in a day? Is a nation born at once? For as soon as Zion was in travail, she brought forth her children. 
\v 9 Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth, saith Jehovah; Shall I, who beget, restrain the birth? saith thy God. 
\v 10 Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, And exult for her, all ye that love her! Be very joyful with her, all ye that mourn for her! 
\v 11 That ye may suck, and be satisfied, from the breast of her consolations, That ye may suck and be delighted with the fulness of her glory. 
\v 12 For thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will bring prosperity to her like a river, And the wealth of the nations like an overflowing stream; Ye shall suck at the breast, Ye shall be carried on the arm, And on the knees shall ye be dandled. 
\v 13 As one whom his mother comforteth, So will I comfort you; And in Jerusalem shall ye be comforted. 
\v 14 Ye shall see, and your heart shall rejoice, And your bones shall flourish like a green plant, And the hand of Jehovah shall be manifested to his servants, And be moved with indignation against his enemies. 
\v 15 For behold, Jehovah cometh with fire, Like a whirlwind are his chariots, To breathe forth his anger in a glowing heat, And his rebuke in flames of fire. 
\v 16 For with fire will Jehovah contend, And with his sword, with all flesh, And many shall be the slain of Jehovah. 
\v 17 They who sanctify and purify themselves in the groves, Following one in the midst, Who eat swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse. They shall all perish together, saith Jehovah. 
\v 18 For I know their works, and their thoughts; The time cometh to gather all nations and tongues together; They shall come, and behold my glory. 
\v 19 And I will give a sign among them, And of those that escape I will send to the nations, To Tarshish, Phul, and Lud, who draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, To the distant coasts, who never heard my name, And who never saw my glory; And they shall declare my glory among the nations. 
\v 20 And they shall bring all your brethren From all the nations, an offering to Jehovah, Upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules and dromedaries, To my holy mountain, Jerusalem, saith Jehovah, As the sons of Israel bring their gifts In pure vessels to the house of Jehovah. 
\v 21 And of them will I also take For priests and for Levites, saith Jehovah. 
\v 22 For as the new heavens, And the new earth, which I make, Endure before me, saith Jehovah, So shall your race and your name endure. 
\v 23 And it shall be, from new moon to new moon, And from sabbath to sabbath, That all flesh shall come and worship before me, saith Jehovah. 
\v 24 Then shall they go forth and see The dead bodies of the men that rebelled against me! For their worm shall not die, And their fire shall not be quenched, And they shall be an abhorrence to all flesh.
