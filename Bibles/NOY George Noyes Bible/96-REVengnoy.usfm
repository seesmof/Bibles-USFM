\mt1 THE REVELATION OF ST. JOHN THE DIVINE 
\c 1  
\p
\v 1 The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to show to his servants what must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel to his servant John; 
\v 2 who bore witness of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ,—of whatever he saw. 
\v 3 Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of the prophecy, and keep the things written therein; for the time is at hand. 
\v 4 John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be to you, and peace, from him who is, and who was, and who is to come; and from the seven spirits which are before his throne; 
\v 5 and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the first-born of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To him that loveth us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, 
\v 6 and made us a kingdom, priests to God his Father, to him be the glory and the dominion for ever. Amen. 
\v 7 Behold, he cometh with the clouds, and every eye shall see him, and they who pierced him; and all the tribes of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen. 
\v 8 I am the Alpha and the Omega, saith the Lord God, he who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty. 
\v 9 I John, your brother, and companion in the affliction and kingdom and endurance in Jesus, was in the isle that is called Patmos, on account of the word of God, and the testimony of Jesus. 
\v 10 I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day; and I heard behind me a loud voice, as of a trumpet, 
\v 11 saying: What thou seest, write in a book, and send it to the seven churches; to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamus, and to Thyatira, and to Sardes, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea. 
\v 12 And I turned to see the voice that was speaking with me; and having turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks, 
\v 13 and in the midst of the candlesticks one like to a son of man, clothed with a garment reaching down to the feet, and girded at the breasts with a golden girdle. 
\v 14 His head and his hairs were white as white wool, as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire; 
\v 15 and his feet were like fine brass, as if burning in a furnace; and his voice was as the sound of many waters. 
\v 16 And he had in his right hand seven stars; and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword; and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength. 
\v 17 And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead; and he laid his right hand on me, saying, Fear not; I am the first and the last, 
\v 18 and he that liveth; and I was dead, and behold, I am alive for evermore; and I have the keys of death and the underworld. 
\v 19 Write therefore the things which thou sawest, and the things which are, and the things which shall be after these; 
\v 20 the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches; and the seven candlesticks are the seven churches. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 To the angel of the church in Ephesus write: These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks: 
\v 2 I know thy works, and thy labor, and thy endurance, and that thou canst not bear evil men; and thou didst try those who say they are apostles, and are not, and didst find them liars; 
\v 3 and thou hast endurance, and hast borne on account of my name, and hast not become weary. 
\v 4 But I have this against thee, that thou hast left thy first love. 
\v 5 Remember therefore whence thou hast fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come to thee, and will remove thy candlestick out of its place, unless thou repent. 
\v 6 But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate. 
\v 7 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. To him that overcometh I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of my God. 
\v 8 And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write: These things saith the first and the last, who was dead, and lived again: 
\v 9 I know thy affliction and poverty, (but thou art rich,) and the blasphemy of those who say they are Jews, and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan. 
\v 10 Fear not the things which thou art about to suffer. Behold, now, the Devil is about to cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye will have tribulation ten days. Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life. 
\v 11 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. He that overcometh shall not be hurt by the second death. 
\v 12 And to the angel of the church in Pergamus write: These things saith he that hath the sharp two-edged sword: 
\v 13 I know where thou dwellest, where the throne of Satan is; and thou holdest fast my name, and didst not deny my faith, even in the days in which Antipas was my witness, my faithful one, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth. 
\v 14 But I have a few things against thee; thou hast there them that hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling-block in the way of the sons of Israel, and to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication. 
\v 15 So thou also hast men holding the teaching of the Nicolaitans, in like manner. 
\v 16 Repent therefore; or else I will come to thee quickly, and will make war with them with the sword of my mouth. 
\v 17 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. To him that overcometh, I will give of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which no one knoweth but he that receiveth it. 
\v 18 And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write: These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass: 
\v 19 I know thy works, and love, and faith, and service, and thy endurance, and that thy last works are more than the first. 
\v 20 But I have this against thee, that thou sufferest thy wife Jezebel, who calleth herself a prophetess, and she teacheth and seduceth my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed to idols. 
\v 21 And I gave her time to repent, and she will not repent of her fornication. 
\v 22 Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and those who together with her commit adultery into great distress, unless they repent of her deeds. 
\v 23 And her children I will slay with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he who searcheth the reins and hearts; and I will give to every one of you according to your works. 
\v 24 But to you I say, the rest who are in Thyatira, as many as have not this teaching, such as have not known “the depths” of Satan, as they speak; I put upon you no other burden; 
\v 25 but that which ye have, hold fast till I come. 
\v 26 And he that overcometh, and he that keepeth my works to the end, to him I will give authority over the nations,— 
\v 27 and he shall rule them with a rod of iron, as the vessels of a potter are broken to shivers,—as I also have received of my Father. 
\v 28 And I will give him the morning star. 
\v 29 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 And to the angel of the church in Sardes write: These things saith he who hath the seven spirits of God, and the seven stars: I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead. 
\v 2 Be watchful, and strengthen the remaining things, that were ready to die; for I have not found thy works perfect before my God. 
\v 3 Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and keep those things, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come as a thief, and thou shalt not know at what hour I will come upon thee. 
\v 4 But thou hast a few names in Sardes which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white, for they are worthy. 
\v 5 He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white garments; and I will not blot out his name from the book of life, and I will acknowledge his name before my Father, and before his angels. 
\v 6 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. 
\v 7 And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: These things saith he who is holy, he who is true, he who hath the key of David; he who openeth, and no one shall shut; and shutteth, and no one shall open: 
\v 8 I know thy works; behold, I have set before thee an open door, which no one can shut; for thou hast little power, and yet hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name. 
\v 9 Behold, I will make those of the synagogue of Satan, who say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie,—behold, I will make them to come and bow down before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee. 
\v 10 Because thou hast kept my injunction of endurance, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which is about to come upon the whole world, to try those who dwell upon the earth. 
\v 11 I come quickly; hold fast that which thou hast, that no one may take thy crown. 
\v 12 He that overcometh, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall nevermore go out; and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my Gods and I will write upon him my new name. 
\v 13 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. 
\v 14 And to the angel of the church in Laodicea write: These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God: 
\v 15 I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot; I would thou wert cold or hot. 
\v 16 So then, because thou art lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I am about to vomit thee out of my mouth. 
\v 17 Because thou sayest, I am rich, and have gotten wealth, and have need of nothing, and knowest not that thou art the wretched and the pitiable one, and poor, and blind, and naked, 
\v 18 I advise thee to buy of me gold refined by fire, that thou mayst be rich; and white garments, that thou mayst be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness may not be made manifest; and eye-salve to anoint thine eyes, that thou mayst see. 
\v 19 As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten. Be zealous therefore, and repent. 
\v 20 Behold, I stand at the door, and knock; if any one hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me. 
\v 21 He that overcometh, I will give to him to sit with me on my throne, even as I also overcame, and sat down with my Father on his throne. 
\v 22 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches, 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 After this I saw, and lo! an open door in heaven; and the former voice, which I heard as of a trumpet speaking with me, said, Come up hither, and I will show thee what things must take place after these. 
\v 2 Immediately I was in the Spirit; and lo! a throne was set ha heaven, and one sat on the throne. 
\v 3 And he who sat was in appearance like a jasper stone and a sardius; and there was a rainbow around the throne like in appearance to an emerald. 
\v 4 And around the throne were twenty-four thrones; and upon the thrones I saw the twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white garments, and on their heads crowns of gold. 
\v 5 And out of the throne proceed lightnings, and voices and thunders; and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God; 
\v 6 and before the throne there was as it were a sea of glass like to crystal; and in the middle before the throne, and around the throne, were four living creatures full of eyes before and behind. 
\v 7 And the first living creature was like a lion, and the second living creature like a calf, and the third living creature had the face of a man, and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle. 
\v 8 And the four living creatures, having each of them six wings, around and within are full of eyes; and they have no rest day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is to come. 
\v 9 And when the living creatures give glory, and honor, and thanksgiving to him that sitteth on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever, 
\v 10 the twenty-four elders fall down before him that sitteth on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying, 
\v 11 Worthy art thou, O Lord, and our God, to receive the glory, and the honor, and the power; for thou didst create all things, and on account of thy will they were, and were created. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and without, sealed fast with seven seals. 
\v 2 And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose its seals? 
\v 3 And no one in heaven, nor on the earth, nor under the earth, was able to open the book, nor to look thereon. 
\v 4 And I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open the book, nor to look thereon. 
\v 5 And one of the elders saith to me, Weep not; behold, the Lion that is of the tribe of Judah, the shoot from David, conquered, he that openeth the book, and its seven seals. 
\v 6 And I saw, between the throne and the four living creatures and the elders, a Lamb standing, as if it had been slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth. 
\v 7 And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. 
\v 8 And when he had taken the book, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, having each one a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints. 
\v 9 And they sing a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open its seals; for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed to God by thy blood men out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation, 
\v 10 and hast made them a kingdom and priests, and they reign on the earth. 
\v 11 And I saw, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders; and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands; 
\v 12 saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive the power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing. 
\v 13 And every creature which is in heaven, and those which are on the earth and under the earth, and on the sea, and the things in them, I heard them all saying, To him that sitteth upon the throne, and to the Lamb, be the blessing, and the honor, and the glory, and the dominion, for ever and ever. 
\v 14 And the four living creatures said Amen. And the elders fell down and worshipped. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1 And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard, as it were the voice of thunder, one of the four living creatures saying, Come! 
\v 2 And I saw, and lo! a white horse, and he that sat on him, having a bow; and a crown was given to him, and he went forth conquering, and to conquer. 
\v 3 And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, Come! 
\v 4 And there went forth another horse, that was red; and to him that sat thereon it was given to take peace from the earth, and that men should slay one another; and there was given to him a great sword. 
\v 5 And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, Come! And I saw, and lo! a black horse, and he that sat on him, having a pair of scales in his hand. 
\v 6 And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures, saying, A quart of wheat for a denary, and three quarts of barley for a denary; and, Hurt not the oil and the wine. 
\v 7 And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the fourth living creature saying, Come! 
\v 8 And I saw, and lo! a pale horse, and the name of him that sat on him was Death; and the underworld was following with him; and there was given to them power over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with famine, and with death, and by the wild beasts of the earth. 
\v 9 And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain on account of the word of God, and on account of the testimony which they had borne; 
\v 10 and they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, the holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth? 
\v 11 And a white robe was given to them, and it was said to them that they should rest yet for a time, until their fellow-servants also and their brethren, that were about to be killed as they were, should finish their course. 
\v 12 And I saw when he had opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the whole moon became as blood, 
\v 13 and the stars of heaven fell to the earth, as a fig-tree casteth its untimely figs when shaken by a great wind; 
\v 14 and the heaven passed off, as a scroll when it is rolled up, and every mountain and island were moved out of their places; 
\v 15 and the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the chief captains, and the rich men, and the strong men, and every bondman and freeman hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains; 
\v 16 and they say to the mountains and the rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb; 
\v 17 for the great day of his wrath is come, and who is able to stand? 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1 And after this, I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that no wind should blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree. 
\v 2 And I saw another angel coming up from the rising of the sun, having the seal of the living God; and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, 
\v 3 saying, Hurt not the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads. 
\v 4 And I heard the number of the sealed. A hundred and forty-four thousand were sealed out of all the tribes of the sons of Israel. 
\v 5 Out of the tribe of Judah were sealed twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Reuben, twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Gad, twelve thousand; 
\v 6 out of the tribe of Asher, twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Naphtali, twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Manasseh, twelve thousand; 
\v 7 out of the tribe of Simeon, twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Issachar, twelve thousand; 
\v 8 out of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Joseph, twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Benjamin twelve thousand were sealed. 
\v 9 After these things I saw, and lo! a great multitude, which no one could number, out of every nation and all tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, and palms in their hands. 
\v 10 And they cry with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God who sitteth upon the throne, and to the Lamb. 
\v 11 And all the angels were standing around the throne and the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God, 
\v 12 saying, Amen; the blessing, and the glory, and the wisdom, and the thanksgiving, and the honor, and the power, and the might, be to our God, for ever and ever. 
\v 13 And one of the elders answered, saying to me, These who are clothed in the white robes, who are they, and whence came they? 
\v 14 And I said to him, My lord, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they who come out of the great tribulation, and they washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. 
\v 15 Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple; and he that sitteth on the throne will make his abode with them. 
\v 16 They shall hunger no more, nor thirst any more; neither shall the sun fall upon them, nor any burning heat; 
\v 17 for the Lamb who is in the midst before the throne is a shepherd to them, and leadeth them to the fountains of the waters of life; and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1 And when be had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about haft an hour. 
\v 2 And I saw the seven angels who stand before God; and there were given to them seven trumpets. 
\v 3 And another angel came, and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given to him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne. 
\v 4 And the smoke of the incense went up with the prayers of the saints before God out of the angel's hand. 
\v 5 And the angel took the censer, and filled it from the fire of the altar, and cast it upon the earth; and there followed thunders, and lightnings, and voices, and an earthquake. 
\v 6 And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound. 
\v 7 And the first sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth; and the third part of the earth was burnt up, and the third part of the trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up. 
\v 8 And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea; 
\v 9 and the third part of the sea became blood; and the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed. 
\v 10 And the third angel sounded, and there fell from heaven a great star, burning as a torch, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters. 
\v 11 And the name of the star is called Wormwood; and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter. 
\v 12 And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars, so that the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night in like manner. 
\v 13 And I saw, and heard an eagle flying in mid-heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to those who dwell on the earth, by reason of the remaining voices of the trumpet of the three angels who are yet to sound! 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fallen out of heaven to the earth, and to him was given the key of the pit of the abyss; 
\v 2 and he opened the pit of the abyss. And there went up a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace, and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit. 
\v 3 And out of the smoke went forth locusts upon the earth, and to them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power; 
\v 4 and it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree, but only those men who have not the seal of God upon their foreheads; 
\v 5 and it was given to them that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months; and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when it hath struck a man. 
\v 6 And in those days men will seek death, and shall not find it; and will desire to die, and death will flee from them. 
\v 7 And the shapes of the locusts were like horses prepared for battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men; 
\v 8 and they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions. 
\v 9 And they had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle. 
\v 10 And they have tails like scorpions, and stings; and in their tails is their power to hurt men five months. 
\v 11 They have over them a king, the angel of the abyss, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek he hath for his name Apollyon. 
\v 12 The first woe is past; behold, two woes more are yet to come. 
\v 13 And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice out of the four horns of the golden altar, which is before God, 
\v 14 saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, Loose the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates. 
\v 15 And the four angels were loosed, who were in readiness for the hour, and day, and month, and year, to slay the third part of men. 
\v 16 And the number of the armies of the horsemen was two hundred thousand thousand; I heard the number of them. 
\v 17 And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and those who sat on them, having breastplates of a fiery, and a dark blue, and a brimstone color; and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions, and out of their mouths issued fire, and smoke, and brimstone. 
\v 18 By these three plagues was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and the smoke, and the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths. 
\v 19 For the power of the horses is in their mouth, and in their tails; for their tails are like to serpents, having heads; and with them they do hurt. 
\v 20 And the rest of men, who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands, that they should not worship demons, and idols of gold, and of silver, and of brass, and of stone, and of wood, which can neither see; nor hear, nor walk; 
\v 21 and they did not repent of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1 And I saw another strong angel coming down from heaven, clothed with a cloud, and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was like the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire. 
\v 2 And he had in his hand a little book open. And he set his right foot upon the sea, and the left upon the land; 
\v 3 and he cried with a loud voice, as a lion roars. And when he had cried, the seven thunders uttered their voices. 
\v 4 And when the seven thunders had spoken, I was about to write; and I heard a voice from heaven saying, Seal up the things which the seven thunders spoke, and write them not. 
\v 5 And the angel whom I saw standing upon the sea, and upon the land, lifted up his right hand to heaven, 
\v 6 and swore by him who liveth for ever and ever, who created the heaven, and the things therein, and the earth and the things therein, and the sea, and the things therein, that there should be no longer delay; 
\v 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, then should be finished the mystery of God, as he declared the glad tidings to his servants the prophets. 
\v 8 And the voice which I heard out of heaven I heard again speaking to me, and saying: Go, take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel who is standing upon the sea, and upon the land. 
\v 9 And I went to the angel, telling him to give me the little book. And he saith to me, Take it, and eat it up; and it will make thy stomach bitter, but in thy mouth it will be sweet as honey. 
\v 10 And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey; and when I had eaten it, my stomach became bitter. 
\v 11 And it was said to me, Thou must again prophesy concerning many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 And there was given me a reed like to a staff, a voice saying: Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein; 
\v 2 but the court which is outside the temple, leave out, and measure it not, for it hath been given to the gentiles; and the holy city will they tread under foot forty-two months. 
\v 3 And I will give power to my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth. 
\v 4 These are the two olive-trees, and the two candlesticks, which stand before the Lord of the earth. 
\v 5 And if any one designs to hurt them, fire goeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies; and if any one designs to hurt them, he must in this manner be killed. 
\v 6 These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy; and have power over the waters, to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with every plague, as often as they will. 
\v 7 And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that cometh up out of the abyss will make war against them, and will overcome them, and kill them. 
\v 8 And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where their Lord also was crucified. 
\v 9 And some from among the peoples, and tribes, and tongues, and nations, will look upon their dead bodies three days and a half, and will not suffer their dead bodies to be put into a tomb. 
\v 10 And they that dwell upon the earth will rejoice over them, and make merry, and will send gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented those who dwelt on the earth. 
\v 11 And after three days and a half the spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon those who saw them. 
\v 12 And they heard a loud voice from heaven, saying to them, Come up hither; and they went up into heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them. 
\v 13 And in that hour there was a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain seven thousand men; and the rest became afraid, and gave glory to the God of heaven. 
\v 14 The second woe is past; behold, the third woe cometh quickly. 
\v 15 And the seventh angel sounded, and there followed loud voices in heaven, saying, The kingdom of the world is become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he will reign for ever and ever. 
\v 16 And the twenty-four elders, who sat before God on their thrones, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God, 
\v 17 saying, We give thanks to thee, O Lord God Almighty, who art and who wast, because thou hast taken thy great power, and hast reigned. 
\v 18 And the nations were enraged, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead to be judged, and to give the reward to thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and to them that fear thy name, the small and the great; and to destroy the destroyers of the earth. 
\v 19 And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and the ark of his covenant was seen in his temple; and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and an earthquake, and a great hailstorm. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 And a great sign was seen in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars; 
\v 2 and being with child she crieth out, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered. 
\v 3 And another sign was seen in heaven; and behold, a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven diadems; 
\v 4 and his tail dragged the third part of the stars of heaven, and cast them to the earth. And the dragon standeth before the woman who was about to bring forth, that when she hath brought forth he may devour her child. 
\v 5 And she brought forth a man-child, who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron; and her child was caught up to God, and to his throne. 
\v 6 And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared by God, that they should nourish her there a thousand two hundred and sixty days. 
\v 7 And there was war in heaven; Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, 
\v 8 and prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven. 
\v 9 And the great dragon was cast down, the old serpent, called the Devil and Satan, who deceiveth the whole world; he was cast down to the earth, and his angels were cast down with him. 
\v 10 And I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, Now is come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ; for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, who accused them before our God day and night; 
\v 11 and they conquered him because of the blood of the Lamb, and because of the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives, even to death. 
\v 12 Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the earth and the sea! for the Devil is come down to you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time. 
\v 13 And when the dragon saw that he was cast down to the earth, he persecuted the woman who brought forth the man-child. 
\v 14 And to the woman were given the two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent. 
\v 15 And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a river, after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away by the river. 
\v 16 And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the river which the dragon cast out of his mouth. 
\v 17 And the dragon was enraged at the woman, and went away to make war with the rest of her offspring, who keep the commandments of God, and maintain the testimony to Jesus. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 And I stood upon the sand of the sea. And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads, and upon his horns ten diadems, and upon his heads names of blasphemy. 
\v 2 And the beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion. And the dragon gave him his power, and his throne, and great authority. 
\v 3 And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed. And the whole earth wondered after the beast. 
\v 4 And they worshipped the dragon, because he gave the authority to the beast; and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like to the beast, and who is able to make war with him? 
\v 5 And there was given to him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemy; and power was given to him to work forty-two months. 
\v 6 And he opened his mouth in blasphemies against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven. 
\v 7 And it was given to him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them; and power was given him over every tribe, and people, and tongue, and nation. 
\v 8 And all who dwell on the earth wilt worship him, every one whose name hath not been written in the book of life of the Lamb that was slain from the foundation of the world. 
\v 9 If any one hath an ear, let him hear. 
\v 10 If any one [[leadeth]] into captivity he shall go into captivity; if any one shall kill with the sword, he must be killed with the sword. Here is the endurance and the faith of the saints. 
\v 11 And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke as a dragon. 
\v 12 And he exerciseth all the authority of the first beast in his presence; and causeth the earth and those who dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed. 
\v 13 And he doeth great signs, so that he even causeth fire to come down from heaven on the earth, in the sight of men. 
\v 14 And he deceiveth them that dwell on the earth, by reason of the signs which it was given him to do in the presence of the beast; commanding those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast which had the wound by a sword, and lived. 
\v 15 And it was given to him to give breath to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should even speak, and cause that all who did not worship the image of the beast should be killed. 
\v 16 And he causeth all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the flee and the bond, to receive a mark on their right hand, or on their forehead; 
\v 17 and that no one shall be able to buy or sell, except him that hath the mark, the name of the beast, or the number of his name. 
\v 18 Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast; for it is the number of a man, and his number is six hundred and sixty-six. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1 And I saw, and lo! the Lamb stood on Mount Zion, and with him a hundred and forty-four thousand, having his name and the name of his Father written on their foreheads. 
\v 2 And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of loud thunder; and the voice which I heard was as that of harpers, harping with their harps. 
\v 3 And they sing a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures and the elders; and no one was able to learn the song but the hundred and forty-four thousand, who were redeemed from the earth. 
\v 4 These are they who were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they who follow the Lamb wherever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, a first-fruits to God and to the Lamb. 
\v 5 And in their mouth was found no falsehood; for they are without fault. 
\v 6 And I saw another angel flying in mid-heaven, having an everlasting message of good tidings to proclaim to those who dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and tribe, and tongue, and people; 
\v 7 saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him, for the hour of his judgment is come; and worship him that made the heaven, and the earth, and sea, and fountains of waters. 
\v 8 And another, a second angel, followed, saying: Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, which hath made all the nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. 
\v 9 And another, a third angel, followed them, saying with a loud voice: If any one worship the beast and his image, and receive the mark on his forehead or on his hand, 
\v 10 the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation, and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the angels, and in the presence of the Lamb. 
\v 11 And the smoke of their torment goeth up for ever and ever; and they have no rest day or night, who worshiped the beast and his image, and whoever receiveth the mark of his name. 
\v 12 Here is the endurance of the saints, who keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus. 
\v 13 And I heard a voice from heaven, saying, Write, Blessed are the dead, who die in the Lord from henceforth. Yea, saith the Spirit, that they shall rest from their labors; and their works do follow them. 
\v 14 And I saw, and lo! a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like to a son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle. 
\v 15 And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap, for the time to reap is come, because the harvest of the earth is ripe. 
\v 16 And he who sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle upon the earth; and the earth was reaped. 
\v 17 And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle. 
\v 18 And another angel came out from the altar, who had power over fire; and he cried with a loud cry to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for the grapes of the earth are fully ripe. 
\v 19 And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the fruit of the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great wine-press of the wrath of God. 
\v 20 And the wine-press was trodden outside the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even to the bits of the horses, to the distance of a thousand six hundred furlongs. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1 And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous seven angels, having seven plagues, which are the last, because in them is completed the wrath of God. 
\v 2 And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire, and those who had gained the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over the number of his name, standing at the sea of glass, having harps of God. 
\v 3 And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying: Great and marvelous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of the nations; 
\v 4 who shall not fear, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy; for all nations shall come and worship before thee, because thy judgments are made manifest. 
\v 5 And after these things I saw, and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened; 
\v 6 and the seven angels who had the seven plagues came forth, clothed in pure shining linen, and girded about the breasts with golden girdles. 
\v 7 And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden vials, full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever. 
\v 8 And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no one was able to enter the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed. 
\c 16  
\p
\v 1 And I heard a loud voice out of the temple, saying to the seven angels, Go, and pour out the seven vials of the wrath of God upon the earth. 
\v 2 And the first departed, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men who had the mark of the beast, and who worshipped his image. 
\v 3 And the second poured out his vial into the sea; and it became blood, as of a dead man, and every living thing died, that was in the sea. 
\v 4 And the third poured out his vial into the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood. 
\v 5 And I heard the angel of the waters saying, Righteous art thou, who art and wast holy, because thou hast judged thus; 
\v 6 for they shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; they deserve it. 
\v 7 And I heard the altar saying, Even so, Lord God Almighty! true and righteous are thy judgments. 
\v 8 And the fourth poured out his vial upon the sun; and it was given to it to scorch men with fire; 
\v 9 and men were scorched with great heat. And men blasphemed the name of God, who had the power over these plagues; and they repented not, to give him glory. 
\v 10 And the fifth poured out his vial upon the throne of the beast; and his kingdom became darkened; and they gnawed their tongues for pain, 
\v 11 and blasphemed the God of heaven, because of their pains and because of their sores; and they repented not of their deeds. 
\v 12 And the sixth poured out his vial upon the great river, the Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings who are from the rising of the sun might be prepared. 
\v 13 And I saw come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs; 
\v 14 for they are the spirits of demons, working signs, which go forth to the kings of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God l Almighty. 
\v 15 Behold, I come as a thief; blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, that he may not walk naked, and his shame be seen. 
\v 16 And he gathered them together into the place called in the Hebrew tongue, Harmegedon. 
\v 17 And the seventh poured out his vial upon the air; and there came forth a loud voice from the temple, from the throne, saying, It is done. 
\v 18 And there followed lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and there was a great earthquake, such as there was not since there was a man upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great. 
\v 19 And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell; and Babylon the great was remembered before God, to give to her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath. 
\v 20 And every island fled away, and no mountains were found; 
\v 21 and there came down from heaven upon men a great storm of hail, every stone weighing about a talent; and men blasphemed God on account of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great. 
\c 17  
\p
\v 1 And there came one of the seven angels who had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying, Come hither; I will show thee the judgment of the great harlot that sitteth upon the many waters; 
\v 2 with whom the kings of the earth committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth were made drunk with the wine of her fornication. 
\v 3 So he carried me away in the Spirit into the wilderness. And I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet-colored beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns. 
\v 4 And the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand, full of abominations and the impurities of the fornication of the earth, 
\v 5 and upon her forehead a name written: MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE HARLOTS AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH. 
\v 6 And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. And when I saw her, I wondered with great wonder. 
\v 7 And the angel said to me, Wherefore didst thou wonder? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads, and the ten horns. 
\v 8 The beast which thou sawest, was, and is not, and is to come up out of the abyss, and goeth into perdition; and they that dwell on the earth, whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, will wonder, when they see the beast, that he was, and is not, and yet will come. 
\v 9 Here is the mind that hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth. 
\v 10 And they are seven kings; five of them are fallen, one is; the other is not yet come, and when he hath come, he must remain a short time. 
\v 11 And the beast that was, and is not, he is an eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition. 
\v 12 And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, who have received no kingdom as yet, but receive authority as kings one hour with the beast. 
\v 13 These have one mind, and give their power and authority to the beast. 
\v 14 These will make war with the Lamb; and the Lamb will overcome them, because he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they who are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful. 
\v 15 And he saith to me, The waters which thou sawest, where the harlot sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues. 
\v 16 And the ten horns which thou sawest, and the beast, these will hate the harlot, and will make her desolate and naked, and will eat her flesh, and will burn her up with fire. 
\v 17 For God hath put in their hearts to do his will, and to form one purpose, and to give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled. 
\v 18 And the woman which thou sawest is the great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth. 
\c 18  
\p
\v 1 After these things I saw another angel coming down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory. 
\v 2 And he cried with a strong voice, saying: Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, and is become a habitation of demons, and a hold of every unclean spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird; 
\v 3 for all the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth became rich out of the abundance of her luxury. 
\v 4 And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues; 
\v 5 for her sins have reached to heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities. 
\v 6 Requite her even as she requited, and render to her double according to her works; in the cup which she mixed, mix to her double. 
\v 7 As much as she glorified herself and lived luxuriously, so much torment and mourning give her. For she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no mourning; 
\v 8 therefore in one day shall her plagues come, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be burned up with fire; for strong is the Lord God who judged her. 
\v 9 And the kings of the earth who committed fornication and lived luxuriously with her shall weep and lament for her, when they see the smoke of her burning, 
\v 10 standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, the great city! Babylon, the mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come. 
\v 11 And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her, because no one buyeth their merchandise any more; 
\v 12 merchandise of gold and of silver, and of precious stones and of pearls, and of fine linen and of purple, and of silk and of scarlet; and all citron wood, and all manner of vessels of ivory, and all manner of vessels of most costly wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble; 
\v 13 and cinnamon, and amomum, and odors, and ointment, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and cattle, and sheep; and merchandise of horses and chariots and slaves; and souls of men. 
\v 14 And the fruits that thy soul desired are departed from thee, and all thy dainty and splendid things are perished from thee, and thou shalt find them no more. 
\v 15 The merchants of these things, who became rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning, 
\v 16 saying: Alas, alas, the great city, that was clothed in tilde linen and purple and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls! 
\v 17 for in one hour so great wealth is made desolate. And every pilot, and every one that saileth to any place, and mariners, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off, 
\v 18 and cried out when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like the great city! 
\v 19 And they cast dust on their heads, and cried out, weeping and mourning, saying: Alas, alas, the great city, whereby were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her wealth! for in one hour she is made desolate. 
\v 20 Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye saints and ye apostles and ye prophets! for God hath avenged you on her. 
\v 21 And a strong angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall Babylon the great city be thrown down, and shall never more be found. 
\v 22 And the sound of harpers, and of musicians, and of pipers, and of trumpeters shall be heard in thee no more, and no craftsman, of whatever craft, shall be found any more in thee, and the sound of a millstone shall never more be heard in thee, 
\v 23 and the light of a lamp shall shine no more in thee, and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard in thee no more; for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorcery were all the nations deceived. 
\v 24 And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that have been slain upon the earth. 
\c 19  
\p
\v 1 After these things I heard as it were a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, Hallelujah I The salvation, and the glory, and the power, belong to our God; 
\v 2 for true and righteous are his judgments; for he hath judged the great harlot, who corrupted the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand. 
\v 3 And a second time they said, Hallelujah! and her smoke goeth up for ever and ever. 
\v 4 And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen, hallelujah! 
\v 5 And a voice came forth from the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, the small and the great. 
\v 6 And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunders, saying, Hallelujah! for the Lord our God the Almighty reigneth. 
\v 7 Let us rejoice and exult, and we will give to him the glory; for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready; 
\v 8 and it was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen, shining and pure. For the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints. 
\v 9 And he saith to me, Write, Blessed are they who are called to the marriage-supper of the Lamb. And he saith to me, These are the true words of God. 
\v 10 And I fell at his feet to worship him; and he saith to me, See thou do it not; I am a fellow-servant of thee, and of thy brethren who maintain the testimony to Jesus; worship God. For the testimony to Jesus is the spirit of prophecy. 
\v 11 And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and he who sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war. 
\v 12 His eyes were a flame of fire, and on his head were many diadems; and he had names written, and a name written which no one knoweth but he himself; 
\v 13 and he was clothed with a garment dipped in blood; and his name is called, The Word of God. 
\v 14 And the armies which are in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and pure. 
\v 15 And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he may smite the nations; and he will rule them with a rod of iron; and he treadeth the wine-press of the fierceness of the wrath of God Almighty. 
\v 16 And he hath on his garment and on his thigh a name written: KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS. 
\v 17 And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in mid-heaven, Come, gather yourselves together to the great supper of God; 
\v 18 that ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of those who sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, lieth small and great. 
\v 19 And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him who sat on the horse, and against his army. 
\v 20 And the beast was seized and he who was with him, the false prophet who wrought the signs in his presence, with which he deceived those who received the mark of the beast, and who worshipped his image; the two were cast alive into the lake of fire burning with brimstone. 
\v 21 And the rest were slain with the sword of him who sat upon the horse, the sword which proceeded out of his mouth; and all the birds were glutted with their flesh. 
\c 20  
\p
\v 1 And I saw an angel coming down from heaven, having the key of the abyss, and a great chain in his hand. 
\v 2 And he laid hold of the dragon, the old serpent, which is the Devil and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, 
\v 3 and cast him into the abyss, and shut him up and set a seal over him, that he may deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years are ended: after that he must be loosed for a short time. 
\v 4 And I saw thrones; and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them; and I saw the souls of those beheaded on account of the testimony to Jesus, and on account of the word of God, and of all who had not worshipped the beast, nor his image, and had not received his mark upon their forehead, or upon their hand; and they lived, and reigned with Christ a thousand years. 
\v 5 And the rest of the dead lived not until the thousand years were ended. This is the first resurrection. 
\v 6 Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection; on these the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years. 
\v 7 And when the thousand years are ended, Satan will be loosed out of his prison; 
\v 8 and will go out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to the war, the number of whom is as the sand of the sea. 
\v 9 And they went up upon the breadth of the earth, and encompassed the camp of the saints, and the beloved city; and fire came down out of heaven, and devoured them. 
\v 10 And the Devil who deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where are also the beast and the false prophet; and they will be tormented day and night for ever and ever. 
\v 11 And I saw a great white throne, and him who sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away, and no place was found for them. 
\v 12 And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life; and the dead were judged out of the things written in the books, according to their works. 
\v 13 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and the underworld gave up the dead which were in them; and they were judged each one according to his works. 
\v 14 And death and the underworld were cast into the lake of fire; this is the second death, the lake of fire. 
\v 15 And if any one was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire. 
\c 21  
\p
\v 1 And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more. 
\v 2 And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. 
\v 3 And I heard a loud voice out of the throne, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them, their God; 
\v 4 and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall mourning, nor crying, nor pain he any more; for the former things are passed away. 
\v 5 And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he saith, Write; for these words are faithful and true. 
\v 6 And he said to me, All things are accomplished. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To him that thirsteth I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely. 
\v 7 He that overcometh shall inherit these things, and I will be his God, and he shall be my son. 
\v 8 But the cowardly, and unbelieving, and the polluted with abominations, and murderers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all the liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone; which is the second death. 
\v 9 And there came one of the seven angels who had the seven vials filled with the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither; I will show thee the bride, the wife of the Lamb. 
\v 10 And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, 
\v 11 having the glory of God; her light was like to a most precious stone, as it were a jasper stone, clear as crystal; 
\v 12 having a wall great and high; having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel; 
\v 13 on the east, three gates; and on the north, three gates; and on the south, three gates; and on the west, three gates. 
\v 14 And the wall of the city had twelve foundation-stones, and on them the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. 
\v 15 And he who talked with me had for a measure a golden reed, to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof. 
\v 16 And the city lieth four-square, and its length is as great as its breadth. And he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal. 
\v 17 And he measured the wall thereof, a hundred and forty-four cubits, according to a man's measure, which is that of an angel. 
\v 18 And the material of its wall was jasper; and the city was of pure gold, like to clear glass. 
\v 19 The foundation-stones of the wall of the city were adorned with all manner of precious stones: the first foundation-stone was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald; 
\v 20 the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprasus; the eleventh, hyacinth; the twelfth, amethyst. 
\v 21 And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; every several gate was of one pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass. 
\v 22 And I saw no temple therein; for the Lord God Almighty is its temple, and the Lamb. 
\v 23 And the city hath no need of the sun, nor of the moon, to shine upon it; for the glory of God lightened it, and the Lamb is the light thereof. 
\v 24 And the nations will walk by the light of it; and the kings of the earth bring their glory into it; 
\v 25 and the gates of it shall not be shut by day, for there will be no night there; 
\v 26 and they will bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it. 
\v 27 And there shall not enter into it anything unclean, or that worketh abomination and falsehood; but only they that are written in the Lamb's book of life.

\v 1 And he showed me a river of water of life, clear as crystal, coming out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. 
\v 2 Between the street of the city and the river, on one side and on the other, is the tree of life, hearing twelve kinds of fruit, and yielding its fruit every month; and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations. 
\v 3 And there shall be no more curse; and the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants will serve him; 
\v 4 and they will see his face, and his name will be upon their foreheads. 
\v 5 And there will be no night, and no need of lamp or light, for the Lord God will shine upon them; and they will reign for ever and ever. 
\v 6 And he said unto me, These words are faithful and true; and the Lord God of the spirits of the prophets sent his angel to show to his servants what must shortly come to pass. 
\v 7 And behold, I come quickly. Blessed is he that keepeth the words of the prophecy of this book. 
\v 8 And I John am he who heard and saw these things; and when I had heard and when I had seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who showed me these things. 
\v 9 And he saith to me, See thou do it not; I am a fellow-servant of thee, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of those who keep the words of this book; worship God. 
\v 10 And he saith to me, Seal not the words of the prophecy of this book; the time is at hand. 
\v 11 He that is unjust, let him be unjust still, and he that is filthy, let him be filthy still; and he that is righteous, let him do righteousness still, and he that is holy, let him be holy still. 
\v 12 Behold, I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give to every one according as his work is. 
\v 13 I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end. 
\v 14 Blessed are they that wash their robes, that they may have a right to the tree of life, and may enter by the gates into the city. 
\v 15 Without are dogs, and sorcerers, and fornicators, and murderers, and idolaters, and whoever loveth and practiseth falsehood. 
\v 16 I Jesus sent my angel to testify these things to you for the churches. I am the shoot and the offspring of David, the bright morning-star. 
\v 17 And the Spirit and the bride say, Come! And let him that heareth say, Come! And let him that thirsteth come! Whoever will, let him take the water of life freely. 
\v 18 I testify to every one that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any one shall add to them, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book; 
\v 19 and if any one shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his part from the tree of life, and out of the holy city, which are written of in this book. 
\v 20 He who testifieth these things saith, Yea, I come quickly. Amen; come, Lord Jesus! 
\v 21 The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all.
