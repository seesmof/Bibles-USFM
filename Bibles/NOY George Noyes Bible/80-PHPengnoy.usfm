\c 1

\v 1 Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, together with the bishops and deacons: 
\v 2 Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
\v 3 I thank my God in all my remembrance of you, 
\v 4 always in every prayer of mine for you all making my prayer with joy 
\v 5 on account of your fellowship in the cause of the gospel from the first day until now; 
\v 6 being confident of this very thing, that he who began in you a good work, will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus; 
\v 7 even as it is right for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, all of you being sharers of the grace bestowed on me. 
\v 8 For God is my witness how much I long for you all in the tender affection of Christ Jesus. 
\v 9 And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all discernment; 
\v 10 so that ye may approve the things that are most excellent, in order that ye may be pure and without offence against the day of Christ, 
\v 11 being filled with the fruit of righteousness which is through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God. 
\v 12 But I wish you to know, brethren, that things with me have resulted in the furtherance of the gospel; 
\v 13 so that my bonds have become known in connection with Christ in the whole camp of the imperial guards, and to all the rest; 
\v 14 and that the great part of the brethren, made confident in the Lord by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear. 
\v 15 Some indeed preach Christ even from envy and strife, and some also from good will. 
\v 16 (1:17) but they who are of a factious spirit preach Christ with no pure intent, thinking to stir up affliction to my bonds. 
\v 17 (1:16) They who are of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel; 
\v 18 What then? Notwithstanding, in every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is preached; and therein do I rejoice, yea, and shall rejoice. 
\v 19 For I know that this will turn out to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, 
\v 20 according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing I shall be put to shame, but that with all boldness, as always, so also now, Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life, or by death. 
\v 21 For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. 
\v 22 But if to live in the flesh, if this is to me the fruit of my labor, then what I should choose, I cannot say; 
\v 23 but I am held in a strait by the two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; for it is far better; 
\v 24 but to abide in the flesh is more needful for your sake. 
\v 25 And being persuaded of this, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your advancement and joy in your faith, 
\v 26 that your glorying in me, in the cause of Christ Jesus, may be more abundant by my coming to you again. 
\v 27 Only conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, that whether I come and see you, or remain absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one soul striving together for the faith of the gospel, 
\v 28 and in nothing terrified by your adversaries; which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation; and that from God; 
\v 29 for to you it was given in behalf of Christ, not only to believe in him, but in his behalf to suffer also; 
\v 30 as ye have the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear of in me. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 If then there is any exhortation in Christ, if any encouragement from love, if any partaking of the Spirit, if any tenderness and compassion, 
\v 2 make my joy full, that ye be of the same mind, having the same love, with union of soul cherishing one mind; 
\v 3 doing nothing in the spirit of faction, or in the spirit of vain-glory, but in humility esteeming others as better than yourselves; 
\v 4 looking each of you not to his own interest, but each to the interest of others also. 
\v 5 Yea, let this mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus, 
\v 6 who, being in the form of God, did not regard it as a thing to be grasped at to be on an equality with God, 
\v 7 but made himself of no consideration, taking the form of a servant, and becoming like men; 
\v 8 and in what appertained to him appearing as a man, he humbled himself, and was obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. 
\v 9 Wherefore God also highly exalted him, and gave him a name which is above every name; 
\v 10 that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those who are in heaven, and those on earth, and those under the earth, 
\v 11 and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God, the Father. 
\v 12 So then, my beloved, as ye always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; 
\v 13 for it is God who worketh in you both to will and to work for his good pleasure. 
\v 14 Do all things without murmurings and doubts; 
\v 15 that ye may be blameless and pure, children of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation; among whom ye shine as luminaries in the world, 
\v 16 holding forth the word of life, that I may have whereof to boast against the day of Christ, that I did not run in vain, or labor in vain. 
\v 17 But if I am even poured out on the sacrifice and ministration of your faith, I rejoice, and rejoice with you all. 
\v 18 For the same reason, do ye also rejoice, and rejoice with me. 
\v 19 But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be cheered when I know your state. 
\v 20 For I have no one like-minded, who will have a true concern for your state; 
\v 21 for all of them are seeking their own things, not those of Christ Jesus. 
\v 22 But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son serves a father, he served with me for the gospel. 
\v 23 Him therefore I hope to send forthwith, as soon as I see how it will go with me; 
\v 24 but I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come soon. 
\v 25 Yet I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labor, and fellow-soldier, but your messenger, and minister to my wants; 
\v 26 for he was longing after you all, and was much troubled, because ye heard that he was sick. 
\v 27 For indeed he was sick near to death; but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow. 
\v 28 I send him therefore the more speedily, that when ye see him ye may again rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful. 
\v 29 Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness, and hold such in honor; 
\v 30 because he was near to death on account of the work, hazarding his life to supply what was wanting on your part in the ministration to me. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord; to write the same things to you, to me is not burdensome, and for you it is safe. 
\v 2 Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workmen, beware of the concision. 
\v 3 For we are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God, and glory in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh; 
\v 4 though I myself have reason for confidence even in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath reason for confidence in the flesh, I more; 
\v 5 circumcised the eighth day, of the race of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews; as to the Law, a Pharisee; 
\v 6 as to zeal, persecuting the church; as to the righteousness which is in the Law, blameless. 
\v 7 But whatever things were gain to me, those for the sake of Christ I have counted but loss. 
\v 8 Nay more, I count all things to be loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as refuse, that I may gain Christ, 
\v 9 and be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the Law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God upon faith; 
\v 10 that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, while becoming like him in his death, 
\v 11 if by any means I may attain to the resurrection from the dead. 
\v 12 Not that I have already obtained, or have been already perfected; but I press on, if I may also lay hold of that for which I was laid hold of by Christ. 
\v 13 Brethren, I do not reckon myself to have laid hold of it; but one thing I do, forgetting the things that are behind, and stretching forth to the things that are before, 
\v 14 I press toward the mark for the prize of the heavenly calling of God in Christ Jesus. 
\v 15 Let us, therefore, as many as are perfect, be of this mind; and if ye have a different mind in anything, even this will God reveal to you. 
\v 16 Nevertheless, whereto we have reached, in that let us walk. 
\v 17 Brethren, be ye followers together of me, and mark those who walk as ye have us for an example. 
\v 18 For many walk, of whom I told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ; 
\v 19 whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, whose mind is on earthly things. 
\v 20 For the country of which we are citizens is heaven, whence also we wait for a Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ, 
\v 21 who will transform the body of our humiliation so that it shall be conformed to the body of his glory, according to the working of the power with which he is able to subdue all things to himself. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 Therefore, my brethren, beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, beloved. 
\v 2 I exhort Euodia, and I exhort Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord; 
\v 3 yea, I entreat thee also, true yoke-fellow, give them aid; since they labored with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and the rest of my fellow-laborers, whose names are in the book of life. 
\v 4 Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say it, rejoice. 
\v 5 Let your moderation be known to all men. The Lord is at hand. 
\v 6 Be anxious about nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God; 
\v 7 and the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, will keep your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. 
\v 8 Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things are honorable, whatever things are right, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things. 
\v 9 The things which ye learned, and received, and heard, and saw in me, these do; and the God of peace will be with you. 
\v 10 But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at length ye have revived again in your care for my welfare; for which indeed ye cared before, but lacked opportunity. 
\v 11 Not that I speak on account of want; for I have learned, in whatever state I am, therewith to be content. 
\v 12 I know how to be abased, and I know also how to abound; in every thing and in all things I have been well taught, both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in want; 
\v 13 I can do all things in him who strengtheneth me. 
\v 14 Notwithstanding, ye did well in sharing with me in my distress. 
\v 15 And ye yourselves also know, Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I went forth from Macedonia, no church communicated with me in an account of giving and receiving, but ye only; 
\v 16 for even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again to my necessity. 
\v 17 Not that I seek for such a gift, but I do seek for fruit that may abound to your account. 
\v 18 But I have all, and abound; I am full, having received from Epaphroditus what was sent from you, a sweet odor, a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God. 
\v 19 But my God will supply all your need according to his riches in glory, in Christ Jesus. 
\v 20 Now to God, our Father, be glory for ever. Amen. 
\v 21 Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren who are with me salute you. 
\v 22 All the saints salute you, but especially they who are of Caesar's household. 
\v 23 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
