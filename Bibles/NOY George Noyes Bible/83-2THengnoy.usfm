\v 1 Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: 
\v 2 Grace be to you, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
\v 3 We ought to thank God always for you, brethren, as is fit, because your faith increaseth exceedingly, and the love of every one of you all toward each ether aboundeth; 
\v 4 so that we ourselves glory in you among the churches of God, for your constancy and faith in all your persecutions and the afflictions which ye endure; 
\v 5 an indication of the righteous judgment of God, by which ye will be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye are also suffering; 
\v 6 since it will be just with God to repay distress to them that distress you, 
\v 7 and to you the distressed rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be manifested from heaven, with the angels of his might, 
\v 8 in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus; 
\v 9 who will be punished with everlasting destruction proceeding from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his power, 
\v 10 when he shall come in that day to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all who believed; for our testimony to you was believed. 
\v 11 For which end we also pray always for you, that our God may count you worthy of your calling, and perfect [[in you]] all pleasure in goodness, and the work of faith, with power; 
\v 12 that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 Now we beseech you, brethren, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our being assembled together unto him, 
\v 2 that ye be not easily shaken in mind, nor troubled, either by spirit, or by word, or by letter as from us, as if the day of the Lord were close at hand. 
\v 3 Let no one deceive you in any manner; for [[that day will not come]] unless the apostasy shall have come first and the man of sin have been revealed, the son of perdition; 
\v 4 he that opposeth and exalteth himself above every one that is called God, or worthy of worship, so that he sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself to be God. 
\v 5 Do ye not remember, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things? 
\v 6 And now ye know what restraineth, in order that he may be revealed in his own time. 
\v 7 For the mystery of lawlessness is already working; only there is one who now restraineth, until he be taken out of the way; 
\v 8 and then will the lawless one be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will consume with the breath of his mouth, and destroy with the manifestation of his coming; 
\v 9 [[he,]] whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power, and signs, and wonders of falsehood, 
\v 10 and in all deceit of unrighteousness for those who are perishing; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. 
\v 11 And for this cause God sendeth them a working of delusion, that they may believe the falsehood; 
\v 12 that they may all be judged, who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness. 
\v 13 But we are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, that God chose you from the beginning to salvation in sanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the truth; 
\v 14 whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
\v 15 So then, brethren, stand firm, and hold fast the traditions which ye were taught by us, whether by word, or by our letter. 
\v 16 Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, our Father, who loved us, and gave us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace, 
\v 17 encourage your hearts, and establish you in every good work and word. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may run and be glorified, as with you, 
\v 2 and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men; for it is not all that have faith. 
\v 3 But faithful is the Lord, who will establish you, and guard you from evil. 
\v 4 And we have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command you. 
\v 5 And the Lord direct your hearts to the love of God, and to perseverance in the cause of Christ. 
\v 6 Now we charge you, brethren, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which they received of us. 
\v 7 For ye yourselves know how ye ought to imitate us; for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you, 
\v 8 neither did we eat any man's bread for nought, but were working with labor and travail night and day, that we might not be burdensome to any of you. 
\v 9 Not because we have not authority, but to make ourselves an example to you, that ye should imitate us. 
\v 10 For also when we were with you, this we commanded you: If any one will not work, neither let him eat. 
\v 11 For we hear of some who walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies. 
\v 12 Now such we charge and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread. 
\v 13 But ye, brethren, be not weary in well-doing. 
\v 14 And if any one obey not our word by this epistle, mark that man; and keep no company with him, that he may be shamed; 
\v 15 yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother. 
\v 16 Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always in every way; the Lord be with you all. 
\v 17 The salutation by the hand of me, Paul; which is the token in every letter; so I write. 
\v 18 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
