\v 1 In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, came Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, against Jerusalem, and besieged it. 
\v 2 And the Lord gave Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God; and he carried them into the land of Shinar, to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure-house of his god. 
\v 3 And the king commanded Ashpenaz, the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the sons of Israel of the king's race, and of the princes, 
\v 4 youths in whom was no blemish, and well favored, and skilful in all wisdom, and having knowledge and intelligence and strength, to stand as servants in the king's palace, and be taught the writing and the language of the Chaldaeans. 
\v 5 And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's food, and of the wine which he drank; so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand as servants before the king. 
\v 6 Now among these were, of the sons of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. 
\v 7 And the prince of the eunuchs gave them other names. To Daniel he gave the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego. 
\v 8 But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank; therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself. 
\v 9 And God gave Daniel favor and kindness from the prince of the eunuchs. 
\v 10 And the prince of the eunuchs said to Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink; for he might see your faces in worse condition than the youths of your age; then shall ye make me endanger my head to the king. 
\v 11 Then said Daniel to the steward whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, 
\v 12 Try thy servants ten days, and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink. 
\v 13 Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenances of the youths that eat of the portion of the king's meat; and as thou seest, deal with thy servants. 
\v 14 And he consented to them in this matter, and tried them ten days. 
\v 15 And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the youths who ate the portion of the king's meat. 
\v 16 So the steward took away the portion of their meat, and the wine which they should drink, and gave them pulse. 
\v 17 And God gave these four youths knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom; and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams. 
\v 18 And at the end of the days, when the king had commanded him to bring them before him, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar. 
\v 19 And the king conversed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. Therefore they stood as servants before the king. 
\v 20 And in all matters of wisdom and understanding concerning which the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the scribes and magicians that were in all his realm. 
\v 21 And Daniel lived even to the first year of Cyrus the king. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, on account of which his spirit was troubled, and his sleep went from him. 
\v 2 Then the king commanded to call the scribes, and the magicians, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldaeans, that they might show the king his dreams; and they came and stood before the king. 
\v 3 And the king said to them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream. 
\v 4 And the Chaldaeans said to the king in Aramaean, O king, live forever! Tell thy servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation. 
\v 5 The king answered and said to the Chaldaeans: The word has gone from me. If ye will not make known to me the dream and the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill. 
\v 6 But if ye show the dream and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive from me gifts, and rewards, and great honor. Therefore show me the dream, and its interpretation! 
\v 7 They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation of it. 
\v 8 The king answered and said, I know of a certain, that ye seek to gain time, because ye see that the word hath gone forth from me. 
\v 9 For if ye do not make known to me the dream, this alone is your purpose, and ye have prepared lying and deceitful words to speak before me till the time be changed. Tell me therefore the dream, and I shall know that ye can show me the interpretation thereof. 
\v 10 The Chaldaeans answered before the king, and said: There is not a man upon the earth who can show what the king requireth; on which account no king, however great and powerful, hath asked such things of any scribe, or magician, or Chaldaean. 
\v 11 It is a hard thing which the king requireth, and there is none other that can show it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with men. 
\v 12 For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon. 
\v 13 And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows, to slay them. 
\v 14 Then Daniel answered with understanding and wisdom to Arioch, the captain of the king's guard, who was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon. 
\v 15 He answered and said to Arioch, the king's captain, Why is the decree so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel. 
\v 16 Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would show the king the interpretation. 
\v 17 Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions; 
\v 18 that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven, concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish, with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. 
\v 19 Then was the secret revealed to Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven. 
\v 20 Daniel spake and said: Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever! for wisdom and might are his. 
\v 21 And he changeth times and seasons; he removeth kings, and setteth up kings; he giveth wisdom to the wise, and knowledge to them that have understanding. 
\v 22 He revealeth deep and secret things; he knoweth what is in darkness, and light dwelleth with him. 
\v 23 I thank thee and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known to me now what we desired of thee; for thou hast now made known to us the king's matter. 
\v 24 Therefore Daniel went in to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and said thus to him: Destroy not the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will show to the king the interpretation. 
\v 25 Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus to him: I have found a man of the captives of Judah that will make known to the king the interpretation. 
\v 26 The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known to me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof? 
\v 27 Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded, the wise men, the scribes, the magicians, the astrologers cannot show to the king; 
\v 28 but there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to King Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the days to come. Thy dream and the visions of thy head upon thy bed were these. 
\v 29 Thy thoughts, O king, came into thy mind, what should come to pass hereafter; and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass. 
\v 30 But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me through any wisdom which I have more than all the living, but to the end that the interpretation might be made known to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart. 
\v 31 Thou, O king, sawest, and behold, a great image. This image, which was high and of surpassing brightness, stood before thee; and its form was terrible. 
\v 32 The head of this image was of fine gold; his breast and his arms of silver; his belly and his thighs of brass; 
\v 33 his legs of iron; his feet, part of iron and part of clay. 
\v 34 Thou sawest till a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet, that were of iron and clay, and broke them to pieces. 
\v 35 Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold broken to pieces together, and became like chaff from the summer threshing-floors, and the wind carried them away, so that no place was found for them; and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth. 
\v 36 This is the dream, and now we will tell the interpretation of it before the king. 
\v 37 Thou, O king, art a king of kings; for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power and strength and glory. 
\v 38 And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the birds of heaven hath he given into thy hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art the head of gold. 
\v 39 And after thee shall arise another kingdom, inferior to thee; and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth. 
\v 40 And a fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron; forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things; even as iron, that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise. 
\v 41 And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes part of potter's clay and part of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay. 
\v 42 And as the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken. 
\v 43 And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves by marriage, but they shall not cleave to each other, even as iron is not mixed with clay. 
\v 44 But in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed; and the kingdom shall be left to no other people but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever; 
\v 45 even as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold. The great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter; and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure. 
\v 46 Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odors to him. 
\v 47 The king answered Daniel and said, Of a truth, your God is the God of gods, and the Lord of kings, and the revealer of secrets, since thou couldst reveal this secret. 
\v 48 Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon. 
\v 49 Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego over the affairs of the province of Babylon; but Daniel was in the gate of the king. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was sixty cubits, and whose breadth was six cubits. He set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon. 
\v 2 Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the satraps, the prefects, and the deputy governors, the chief judges, the treasurers, the judges, the counsellors, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. 
\v 3 Then the satraps, prefects, and deputy governors, the chief judges, treasurers, judges, counsellors, and all the rulers of the provinces were gathered together to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. 
\v 4 Then a herald cried aloud: To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages, 
\v 5 that at the time ye hear the sound of the horn, the pipe, the harp, the sambuck, the psaltery, the bagpipe, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the golden image which Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up. 
\v 6 And whoso doth not fall down and worship shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. 
\v 7 Therefore at the time when all the people heard the sound of the horn, the pipe, the harp, the sambuck, the psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the people, the nations, and the languages fell down and worshipped the golden image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. 
\v 8 Wherefore at that time certain Chaldaeans came near, and accused the Jews. 
\v 9 They spake and said to King Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live forever! 
\v 10 Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the horn, the pipe, the harp, the sambuck, the psaltery, the bagpipe, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image; 
\v 11 and that whoso doth not fall down and worship shall be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. 
\v 12 Now there are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, these men, O king, have not regarded thee; they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up. 
\v 13 Then Nebuchadnezzar in rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men before the king. 
\v 14 Nebuchadnezzar spake and said to them, Was it by design, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego? Do ye not serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up? 
\v 15 Now if ye be ready that at the time ye hear the sound of the horn, the pipe, the harp, the sambuck, the psaltery, the bagpipe, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the image which I have set up, well! but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is the God that shall deliver you out of my hands? 
\v 16 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer thee in this matter. 
\v 17 Behold, our God, whom we serve, is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thy hand, O king! 
\v 18 But if not, be it known to thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up. 
\v 19 Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. And he spake and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was wont to be heated. 
\v 20 And he commanded the mightiest men in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace. 
\v 21 Then these men were bound in their trousers, their under-garments, their mantles, and their other clothing, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace. 
\v 22 And because the command of the king was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire killed those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. 
\v 23 And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace. 
\v 24 Then Nebuchadnezzar, the king, was astonished, and rose up in haste, and spake, and said to his counsellors, Did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said to the king, True, O king! 
\v 25 He answered and said, Behold, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt, and the appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods. 
\v 26 Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spake and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, ye servants of the Most High God, come forth! Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came forth out of the midst of the fire. 
\v 27 And the satraps, prefects, and deputy governors, and the counsellors of the king, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was a hair of their head singed, nor were their trousers changed, nor had the smell of fire passed on them. 
\v 28 Then Nebuchadnezzar spake and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants, that trusted in him, and disobeyed the command of the king, and gave up their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god except their own God! 
\v 29 Therefore I make a decree, that every people, nation, and language which speaks anything reproachful against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and its houses shall be made a dunghill; because there is no other God that can deliver in this manner. 
\v 30 Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 Nebuchadnezzar the king to all people, nations, and languages that dwell upon the whole earth. Peace be multiplied to you! 
\v 2 I have thought it good to show the signs and wonders which the Most High God hath wrought toward me. 
\v 3 How great are his signs, and how mighty are his wonders! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion endureth from generation to generation. 
\v 4 I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at ease in my house, and flourishing in my palace. 
\v 5 There I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me. 
\v 6 Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me; that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream. 
\v 7 Then came in the scribes, the magicians, the Chaldaeans, and the astrologers; and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known to me its interpretation. 
\v 8 But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name is Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods, and I told him the dream. 
\v 9 O Belteshazzar, chief of the scribes, since I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret is too hard for thee, tell me the visions of my dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof. 
\v 10 The visions of my head were these. I saw, and behold a tree in the midst, whose height was very great. 
\v 11 The tree was large and strong, and its height reached to heaven, and it might be seen to the end of the whole earth. 
\v 12 The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit abundant, and in it was food for all. The beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the birds of heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof, and all flesh was fed of it. 
\v 13 I saw, in the visions of my head upon my bed, and behold, a watcher, even a holy one, came down from heaven; 
\v 14 he cried aloud, and spake thus: Hew down the tree, and cut off its branches; shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit; let the beasts go away from under it, and the birds from its branches. 
\v 15 Yet leave the stump of its roots in the earth, in bands of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and he shall be wet with the dew of heaven, and his portion shall be with the beasts in the grass of the field. 
\v 16 His heart shall be changed, and be no more that of a man, and a beast's heart shall be given him, and seven times shall pass over him. 
\v 17 By a decision of the watchers is the decree, and by a command of the holy ones is the sentence; to the intent that the living may know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdoms of men, and giveth them to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over them the lowest of men. 
\v 18 This dream I, King Nebuchadnezzar, saw, and do thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation thereof, forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known to me the interpretation; but thou art able, for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee. 
\v 19 Then Daniel, who was called Belteshazzar, was amazed for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spake and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream or the interpretation thereof trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the signification of it to thine enemies! 
\v 20 The tree which thou sawest, which was large and strong, whose height reached to heaven, and which might be seen by all the earth, 
\v 21 whose leaves were fair, and whose fruit abundant, and in which was food for all, under which all the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whoso branches the birds of heaven had their lodging,— 
\v 22 it is thou, O king, who art become great and strong; for thy greatness is immense, and reacheth to heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth. 
\v 23 And whereas the king saw a watcher, even a holy one, coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down and destroy it, yet leave the stump of its roots in the earth, in bands of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field, and he shall be wet with the dew of heaven, and his portion shall be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him; 
\v 24 this is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the Most High, which is come upon my lord, the king; 
\v 25 they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall let thee eat grass as oxen, and be wet with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdoms of men, and giveth them to whomsoever he will. 
\v 26 And whereas it was commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree, thy kingdom shall be sure to thee after thou shalt have acknowledged that Heaven ruleth. 
\v 27 Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thy iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening out of thy tranquility. 
\v 28 All this came upon King Nebuchadnezzar. 
\v 29 At the end of twelve months, he was walking in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon; 
\v 30 and the king spake and said, Is not this the great Babylon which I have built for the seat of the kingdom by the might of my power and for the honor of my majesty? 
\v 31 While the word was in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from heaven: “To thee it is said, O Nebuchadnezzar! the kingdom is departed from thee. 
\v 32 And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field; they shall make thee eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdoms of men, and giveth them to whomsoever he will.” 
\v 33 The same hour was the word fulfilled against Nebuchadnezzar, and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles' feathers, and his nails like birds' claws. 
\v 34 But at the end of the days, I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up my eyes to heaven, and my understanding returned to me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honored Him that liveth forever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and whose kingdom endureth from generation to generation. 
\v 35 And all the inhabitants of the earth are counted as nothing; and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand, or say to him, What doest thou? 
\v 36 At the same time my reason returned to me, and also the glory of my kingdom, my honor, and my splendor returned to me; and my counsellors and my lords sought me; and I was established in my kingdom, and I received yet greater majesty. 
\v 37 Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honor the King of heaven; all whose works are truth and his ways justice; and those that walk in pride he is able to abase. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 Belshazzar, the king gave a great feast to his thousands lords, and drank wine before the thousand. 
\v 2 Belshazzar, while he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple at Jerusalem; that the king and his princes, his wives and his concubines, might drink therein. 
\v 3 Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God at Jerusalem; and the king and his princes, his wives and his concubines, drank in them. 
\v 4 They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone. 
\v 5 In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote over against the chandelier upon the plaster of the wall of the king's palace; and the king saw the hand that wrote. 
\v 6 Then the king's countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosened, and his knees smote one against the other. 
\v 7 The king cried aloud to bring in the magicians, the Chaldaeans, and the astrologers. And the king spake and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whoever shall read this writing, and show me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall rule as the third in the kingdom. 
\v 8 Then all the king's wise men came in; but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king its signification. 
\v 9 Then was King Belshazzar in great consternation, and his countenance was changed, and his lords were amazed. 
\v 10 Then the queen, on account of this affair of the king and his lords, came into the banquet-house; and the queen spake and said, O king, live forever! Let not thy thoughts terrify thee, nor let thy countenance be changed. 
\v 11 There is a man in thy kingdom in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father, light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, were found in him; and the king Nebuchadnezzar, thy father, made him chief of the scribes, the magicians, the Chaldeans, and the astrologers, thy father, O king! 
\v 12 forasmuch as an excellent spirit and knowledge and understanding to interpret dreams, and to explain hard sentences, and solve difficult questions were found in him, in Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar; now let Daniel be called, and he will show the interpretation. 
\v 13 Then was Daniel brought in before the king. And the king spake and said to Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, of the captives of Judah, whom the king, my father, brought out of Judaea? 
\v 14 I have heard concerning thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom are found in thee. 
\v 15 And now the wise men and the magicians have been brought in before me, that they might read this writing, and make known to me its signification; but they could not show the signification of the thing. 
\v 16 But I have heard of thee that thou canst give interpretations, and solve difficult questions. Now if thou canst read the writing and make known to me its signification, thou shalt be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt rule as the third in the kingdom. 
\v 17 Then answered Daniel and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another: yet I will read the writing to the king, and make known to him the signification. 
\v 18 O king, the Most High God gave to Nebuchadnezzar, thy father, a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honor. 
\v 19 And by reason of the majesty which he gave him, all people, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him; whom he would he slew, and whom he would he kept alive; whom he would he set up, and whom he would he put down. 
\v 20 But when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit hardened in pride, he was thrust down from his kingly throne, and his glory was taken from him. 
\v 21 And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart became like the beasts, and his dwelling was with wild asses; he was fed with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; till he knew that the Most High God ruled in the kingdoms of men, and set up over them whomsoever he would. 
\v 22 And thou, his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thy heart, though thou knewest all this; 
\v 23 but hast lifted thyself up against the Lord of heaven; and the vessels of his house have been brought before thee, and thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines have drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know; and the God in whose hand is thy breath, and whose are all thy ways, thou hast not honored. 
\v 24 Then was sent from him the hand, and this writing was written. 
\v 25 And this is the writing which was written: Numbered, Numbered, Weighed, and To be Divided. 
\v 26 And this is the interpretation of it. Numbered: God hath numbered thy kingdom, and made an end of it. 
\v 27 Weighed: Thou art weighed in the balances, and found wanting. 
\v 28 Divided: Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians. 
\v 29 Then Belshazzar commanded, and they clothed Daniel with purple, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made a proclamation concerning him that he should be third ruler in the kingdom. 
\v 30 In the same night was Belshazzar, the king of the Chaldaeans, slain; 
\v 31 and Darius the Mede took the kingdom, being about sixty-two years old. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1 It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom a hundred and twenty satraps, which should be over the whole kingdom, 
\v 2 and over them three presidents, of whom Daniel was one, that the satraps might give accounts to them, and the king might have no damage. 
\v 3 Then this Daniel was eminent above the presidents and satraps, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm. 
\v 4 Then the presidents and satraps sought to find occasion against Daniel in relation to the kingdom; but they could find no occasion nor fault; because he was faithful, and no error nor fault was found in him. 
\v 5 Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, unless we find it against him concerning the law of his God. 
\v 6 Then these presidents and satraps rushed together to the king, and spake thus to him: King Darius, live forever! 
\v 7 All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors and the satraps, the counsellors and the prefects, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions. 
\v 8 Now, O king, establish the decree and sign the writing that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians which altereth not. 
\v 9 Wherefore King Darius signed the writing and the decree. 
\v 10 Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house, his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, and three times a day he kneeled upon his knees, and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as he had done before. 
\v 11 Then these men rushed together, and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God. 
\v 12 Then they came near and spake before the king concerning the royal decree: Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man who shall ask a petition of any god or man within thirty days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not. 
\v 13 Then answered they and said before the king, Daniel, who is of the sons of the captives of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the decree which thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day. 
\v 14 Then the king, when he heard these words, was much troubled, and set his heart to deliver him; and he labored till the going down of the sun to deliver him. 
\v 15 Then these men assembled before the king, and said to the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, that no decree or statute which the king establisheth may be changed. 
\v 16 Then the king commanded that they should bring Daniel and cast him into the den of lions. And the king spake and said to Daniel, May thy God, whom thou servest continually, deliver thee! 
\v 17 And a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords, that nothing concerning Daniel might be changed. 
\v 18 Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting, and suffered not the concubines to be brought to him; and his sleep went from him. 
\v 19 Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste to the den of lions. 
\v 20 And when he came to the den, he cried with a troubled voice to Daniel; and the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, has thy God, whom thou servest continually, been able to deliver thee from the lions? 
\v 21 Then said Daniel to the king, O king, live forever! 
\v 22 My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, so that they have not hurt me; forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no wrong. 
\v 23 Then was the king exceedingly glad, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he trusted in his God. 
\v 24 And the king commanded, and they brought those men who had accused Daniel, and cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and broke all their bones before they came to the bottom of the den. 
\v 25 Then King Darius wrote to all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied to you! 
\v 26 I make a decree, that in every government of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel; for he is the living God that endureth forever, and whose kingdom shall not be destroyed, and whose dominion shall endure to the end. 
\v 27 It is he that delivereth and rescueth, and worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions. 
\v 28 This Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1 In the first year of Belshazzar, king of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream, and visions of his head upon his bed. Then he wrote the dream, and related the sum of the matters. 
\v 2 Daniel spake and said:—I saw in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven burst forth upon the great sea. 
\v 3 And four great beasts came up out of the sea, diverse one from another. 
\v 4 The first was like a lion, and had the wings of an eagle; I beheld till its wings were plucked from it, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made to stand upon its feet like a man, and a man's heart was given to it. 
\v 5 And behold, another beast, the second, like to a bear; and it stood up on one side, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth; and they spake thus to it: Arise, devour much flesh! 
\v 6 After this I beheld, and lo, another, like a leopard, which had upon its back four wings of a bird; the beast also had four heads, and dominion was given to it. 
\v 7 After this I saw in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, dreadful, and terrible, and exceedingly strong; and it had great iron teeth; it devoured, and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet, and it differed from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns. 
\v 8 I gave heed to the horns, and behold, there came up among them another little horn, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots; and behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things. 
\v 9 I beheld, till thrones were placed, and an aged one seated himself, his garment white like snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne like a fiery flame, and its wheels like burning fire. 
\v 10 A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him; thousands of thousands ministered to him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him; the tribunal sat, and the books were opened. 
\v 11 I beheld; and because of the great words which the horn spake, I beheld till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed and given to the burning flame. 
\v 12 As to the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away, for the duration of their lives had been appointed for a season and a time. 
\v 13 I saw in the night visions, and behold, with the clouds of heaven came one like a son of man, and came to the aged one, and they brought him near before him. 
\v 14 And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages should serve him; his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom shall not be destroyed. 
\v 15 I Daniel was grieved in my spirit within me, and the visions of my head troubled me. 
\v 16 I came near to one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me, and made known to me the interpretation of the things. 
\v 17 These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth. 
\v 18 Then shall the saints of the Most High receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom forever, even for ever and ever. 
\v 19 Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth beast, which differed from all the others, exceedingly dreadful, whose teeth were of iron and his nails of brass, which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet; 
\v 20 and concerning the ten horns which were in his head, and the other which came up, and before which three fell,—even that horn which had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, and whose appearance was larger than that of his fellows. 
\v 21 I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints and prevailed against them, 
\v 22 until the aged one came, and judgment was rendered to the saints of the Most High, and the time came that the saints should possess the kingdom. 
\v 23 He spake thus: The fourth beast is a fourth kingdom upon the earth, which shall differ from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces. 
\v 24 And the ten horns are ten kings, which shall arise out of this kingdom; and another shall arise after them; and he shall differ from the former, and shall subdue three kings. 
\v 25 And he will speak great words against the Most High, and will harass the saints of the Most High, and will resolve to change times and laws; and they shall be given into his hand a time, and times, and half a time. 
\v 26 But the tribunal shall sit, and his dominion shall be taken away, and consumed and destroyed forever. 
\v 27 And the sovereignty and dominion and power over all kingdoms under the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High; his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him. 
\v 28 Here ended his words. As for me Daniel, my thoughts terrified me much, and my countenance changed; but I kept the matter in my heart. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1 In the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar, a vision appeared to me, to me, Daniel, after that which appeared to me at the first. 
\v 2 And I saw in a vision, and when I saw, I was in Shushan, in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and was by the river Ulai. 
\v 3 And I lifted up my eyes and saw, and behold, there stood before the river a ram, which had two horns; and the two horns were high, and one was higher than the other; and the higher came up last. 
\v 4 I saw the ram pushing westward and northward and southward, and no beast could stand before him, and none could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will and became great. 
\v 5 And I gave heed, and behold, a he-goat came from the west, over the face of the whole earth, without touching the ground; and the goat had a conspicuous horn between his eyes. 
\v 6 And he came to the ram which had two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran against him in the fury of his power. 
\v 7 And I saw him come close to the ram, and he was enraged against him, and smote the ram, and broke in pieces his two horns; and there was no power in the ram to stand before him; and he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him; and none could deliver the ram out of his hand. 
\v 8 And the he-goat became exceedingly great; but when he became strong the great horn was broken, and instead of it grew up four conspicuous ones toward the four winds of heaven. 
\v 9 And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which became exceedingly great toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the beautiful land. 
\v 10 And it exalted itself even to the host of heaven, and some of the host and of the stars it cast down to the ground, and stamped upon them. 
\v 11 Yea, he magnified himself even to the Prince of the host, and the daily sacrifice did he take away from him, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down. 
\v 12 And a host was placed over the daily sacrifice with impiety, and it cast down truth to the ground, and it accomplished its purpose and prospered. 
\v 13 And I heard a holy one speak; and another holy one said to the one that had spoken, To how long a time extendeth the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the impiety of the destroyer, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot? 
\v 14 And he said to me, To two thousand and three hundred evenings and mornings; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed. 
\v 15 And it came to pass, that when I Daniel saw the vision, I sought for the meaning; and behold, there stood one before me having the appearance of a man. 
\v 16 And I heard a man's voice between the banks of Ulai, which called and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision. 
\v 17 And he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face, and he said to me, Understand, O son of man! for this vision relateth to the time of the end. 
\v 18 But when he spake to me, I sank senseless upon my face to the ground; but he touched me, and lifted me up where I had stood. 
\v 19 And he said, Behold, I make known to thee what shall be in the latter time of the indignation; for [[the vision relateth]] to the time of the end. 
\v 20 The ram which thou sawest, having two horns, denoteth the kings of Media and Persia. 
\v 21 And the rough goat is the king of Greece; and the great horn between his eyes is the first king. 
\v 22 And as that was broken, and four arose in its place, four kingdoms shall arise out of the nation, but not with his power. 
\v 23 And toward the end of their reign, when the transgressors have filled up the measure of their iniquities, a king shall arise of a fierce countenance, and cunning in artifices. 
\v 24 And his power shall become mighty, but not by his own strength; and wonderfully will he destroy, and prosper, and accomplish his purposes, and he will destroy many, even the people of the holy ones. 
\v 25 And through his cunning will he cause fraud to prosper in his hand, and he will magnify himself in his heart, and he will destroy many in the midst of security, and against the Prince of princes will he stand up; but he shall be broken without hand. 
\v 26 And the vision of the evening and the morning, which was told thee, is true; but do thou seal up the vision, for it relates to many days. 
\v 27 And I Daniel fainted, and was sick some days; then I rose up and did the king's business; and I was astonished at the vision, but no one explained it. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 In the first year of Darius, the son of Ahasuerus, of the race of the Medes, who became king over the realm of the Chaldaeans, 
\v 2 in the first year of his reign, I Daniel attentively considered in the Books the number of the years, concerning which the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah the prophet, that Jerusalem should remain in ruins till they were accomplished, namely, seventy years. 
\v 3 And I set my face toward God, the Lord, and made prayers and supplications, with fasting and sackcloth and ashes. 
\v 4 And I prayed to Jehovah, my God, and made my confession, and said, O Lord, the great and terrible God, who keepeth the covenant and mercy to them that love him and keep his commandments! 
\v 5 We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and thy statutes. 
\v 6 Neither have we hearkened to thy servants, the prophets, who spake in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land. 
\v 7 To thee, O Lord, belongeth righteousness, but to us confusion of face, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to all Israel, to those that are near and to those that are far off through all the countries whither thou hast driven them because of their trespass which they have trespassed against thee. 
\v 8 O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against thee. 
\v 9 Yet with the Lord our God is mercy and forgiveness. For we have rebelled against him, 
\v 10 and have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants, the prophets. 
\v 11 Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, and turned away, so as not to obey thy voice; therefore the curse is poured out upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses, the servant of God, because we have sinned against him. 
\v 12 And he hath fulfilled his word which he spake against us, and against our judges who judged us, by bringing great calamity upon us; for under the whole heaven hath it not been done as hath been done to Jerusalem. 
\v 13 As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil came upon us. For we made not our prayer to Jehovah our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, and give heed to thy truth. 
\v 14 Therefore hath Jehovah our God kept his mind upon the evil, and brought it upon us; for Jehovah our God is righteous in all his works which he doeth; for we obeyed not his voice. 
\v 15 And now, O Lord our God, that broughtest thy people forth from the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and madest thee a name such as it is at this day, we have sinned, we have done wickedly. 
\v 16 O Lord, according to all thy goodness, let thine anger and thy fury, I beseech thee, be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain! for because of our iniquities, and the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that are about us. 
\v 17 Now, therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake! 
\v 18 O my God, incline thine ear, and hear! open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name! for we do not present our supplications before thee on account of our righteousness, but on account of thy great mercy. 
\v 19 O Lord, hear! O Lord, forgive! O Lord, hearken and do! Defer not, for thine own sake, O my God! For thy city and thy people are called by thy name. 
\v 20 And while I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin, and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before Jehovah my God, for the holy mountain of my God, 
\v 21 yea, while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the former vision, came, weary with running, and reached me about the time of the evening oblation. 
\v 22 And he instructed me, and talked with me, and said: Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee understanding. 
\v 23 At the beginning of thy supplication a word went forth, and I am come to show it thee; for thou art greatly beloved; therefore give heed to the word, and consider the vision. 
\v 24 Seventy weeks are appointed for thy people, and for thy holy city, to complete the iniquity, and to fill up the measure of the sins, and to expiate the guilt, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal vision and prophet, and to anoint a holy of holies. 
\v 25 Know, therefore, and understand! From the going forth of the word that Jerusalem should be restored and built till an anointed one, a prince, are seven weeks; and during sixty-two weeks it shall be restored and built with streets and moats, yet in troublous times. 
\v 26 And after the sixty-two weeks shall an anointed one be cut off, and there shall not be to him [[a successor]]; and the city and the sanctuary shall be destroyed by the people of a prince that shall come, whose end will be as in a flood; and to the end shall be war, decreed desolations. 
\v 27 And he will establish a covenant with many for one week, and during half a week he will cause sacrifice and oblation to cease, and upon the wing of abominations shall come the destroyer, until decreed destruction be poured out on the destroyer. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1 In the third year of Cyrus, king of Persia, was a revelation made to Daniel, who was also called Belteshazzar; and the revelation is true, and relateth to long warfare. And he gave heed to the revelation, and had understanding of the vision. 
\v 2 In those days, I Daniel was mourning three full weeks. 
\v 3 I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine into my mouth, till three whole weeks were ended. 
\v 4 And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river Hiddekel, 
\v 5 I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, a certain man, clothed in linen garments, and his loins girded with gold of Uphaz. 
\v 6 His body was like chrysolite, and his face had the appearance of lightning, and his eyes were as torches of fire, and his arms and his feet like the appearance of polished brass, and the sound of his words was as the shout of a multitude. 
\v 7 And I Daniel alone saw the vision and the men who were with me saw not the vision; but a great terror fell upon them, and they fled to hide themselves. 
\v 8 Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision; and there remained no strength in me, and my color was changed upon me into a deadly paleness, and I retained no strength. 
\v 9 And I heard the sound of his words; and as I heard the sound of his words, I fell senseless upon my face, and my face toward the ground. 
\v 10 And behold, a hand touched me, and lifted me upon my knees and the palms of my hands. 
\v 11 And he said to me, Daniel, much-beloved man, give heed to the words which I speak to thee, and stand upright! for to thee am I now sent. And when he said this to me, I stood up trembling. 
\v 12 Then said he to me, Fear not, Daniel! for from the first day that thou didst set thy mind to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come on account of thy words. 
\v 13 But the prince of the kingdom of Persia stood up against me one and twenty days; but lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I was left there victorious with the kings of Persia. 
\v 14 Now I am come to teach thee what shall befall thy people in the latter days; for the vision yet relates to distant days. 
\v 15 And when he had spoken these words to me, I set my face toward the ground, and was dumb. 
\v 16 And behold, one having the appearance of the sons of men touched my lips; then I opened my mouth and spake, and said to him that stood before me, O my lord, by the vision my pain came upon me, and I have no strength left. 
\v 17 And how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? And now there remaineth no strength in me, neither is breath left in me. 
\v 18 Then one having the appearance of a man again touched me and strengthened me, 
\v 19 and said, Fear not, much-beloved man! peace be to thee! be strong, yea, be strong! And while he was speaking with me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me. 
\v 20 Then he said, Knowest thou wherefore I have come to thee? And now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia, and I will go forth, and behold, the prince of Greece will come. 
\v 21 But I will show thee what is written in the book of truth. No one putteth forth his strength with me against them but Michael, your prince. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 And I also, in the first year of Darius the Mede, stood up to confirm and strengthen him. 
\v 2 And now I will tell thee what is true. Behold, there shall arise yet three kings in Persia, and the fourth shall be far richer than they all; and, relying upon his riches, he shall stir up all against the realm of Greece. 
\v 3 But a mighty king shall arise, and rule with great dominion, and do according to his will. 
\v 4 But when he shall have arisen, his kingdom shall be broken in pieces, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his posterity, nor with the dominion with which he ruled; for his kingdom shall be plucked up, and divided amongst others besides those. 
\v 5 And the king of the South shall become strong; but one of his princes shall become stronger than he, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great dominion. 
\v 6 And after some years they shall ally themselves with each other; and the daughter of the king of the South shall come to the king of the North, to make peace; but she shall not retain the power of giving aid; neither shall he stand, nor his aid; but she shall be given up, and they that caused her to go, and he that begat her, and he that received her in those times. 
\v 7 But from a shoot of her roots shall one arise in his place, who shall come to an army, and shall come against the fortresses of the king of the North, and shall deal with them according to his pleasure, and prevail against them. 
\v 8 And their gods, with their molten images, and their precious vessels of silver and of gold, shall he carry into captivity into Egypt; then shall he stand away for many years from the king of the North; 
\v 9 and he shall come against the kingdom of the king of the South, but he shall return into his own land. 
\v 10 But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of large forces; and one of them shall move onward, and overflow, and pass through, and shall again stir himself up to carry on the war even to his stronghold. 
\v 11 Then shall the king of the South be enraged, and shall come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the North; and shall lead forth a great multitude, and the multitude shall be given into his hand. 
\v 12 And the multitude shall be elated, and his heart shall be lifted up, and he shall cast down tens of thousands; but he shall not be strong. 
\v 13 For the king of the North shall return and raise up against him a multitude greater than the former, and shall steadily come after certain years with a great army and with great riches. 
\v 14 And in those times many will stand up against the king of the South; and violent men of thy people shall exalt themselves, so as to establish the vision, and shall fall. 
\v 15 And the king of the North shall come, and cast up a mound, and take a fortified city; and the arms of the South shall not withstand, neither his chosen men, neither shall there be any strength to withstand. 
\v 16 And he that cometh against him shall do according to his will, and none shall stand before him; and he shall stand in the beautiful land, and destruction shall be in his hand. 
\v 17 And he shall set his face to come with the strength of his whole kingdom, and shall make pacification with him; and he shall give him his daughter in marriage, to ruin his dominion. But it shall not succeed, neither shall it be for him. 
\v 18 After this he shall turn his face to the isles, and shall take many; but a commander shall put an end to his scorn; nay, shall cause his scorn to return upon himself. 
\v 19 Then shall he turn his face to the strongholds of his own land; and he shall stumble, and fall, and shall not be found. 
\v 20 Then shall arise in his place one who shall send an exacter of tribute through the glory of his kingdom; but within few days shall he be destroyed, neither by anger nor by battle. 
\v 21 And in his place shall arise a despised person, to whom they shall not give the honor of the kingdom; but in the midst of peace he shall come in and obtain the kingdom by flatteries. 
\v 22 And the forces of a flood shall be overwhelmed before him, and shall be broken in pieces; and even the prince that is allied with him. 
\v 23 For after making a league with him, he will practise deceit; for he will come up, and prevail with a small people. 
\v 24 In the midst of security shall he come into the fattest provinces of the land, and he shall do what his fathers never did, nor his fathers' fathers; he shall scatter among them prey, and spoil, and riches; and he shall form his devices against the strongholds, even to a set time. 
\v 25 And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the South, with a great army; and the king of the South shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand, for they shall form devices against him. 
\v 26 Even they that eat of his own food shall destroy him; and his army shall overflow, and many shall fall down slain. 
\v 27 And the hearts of both these kings shall be to do mischief; and at one table shall they speak lies; but it shall not prosper; for yet the end is for the appointed time. 
\v 28 Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and he will set his heart against the holy covenant, and he will execute his purposes, and return to his own land. 
\v 29 At the appointed time he shall again go against the South; but the second time it shall not be as at the first. 
\v 30 For the Chittaean ships shall come against him, and he shall be discouraged, and return, and be enraged against the holy covenant, and execute his purposes; and he shall again have an understanding with them that forsake the holy covenant. 
\v 31 And forces shall be raised by him, which shall pollute the sanctuary, the stronghold, and take away the daily sacrifice, and set up the abomination of the destroyer. 
\v 32 And such as do wickedly against the covenant will he lead to apostasy by flatteries; but the people that know their God shall be strong, and do exploits. 
\v 33 And they that have understanding among the people shall instruct many; but they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil, many days. 
\v 34 And whilst they fall they shall receive a little help, and many shall join themselves to them with flatteries. 
\v 35 And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purify, and cleanse, even to the time of the end, for it is yet at the time appointed. 
\v 36 And the king shall do according to his will; and he will exalt himself and magnify himself against every god, and he will speak horrible things against the God of gods, and he will prosper until the indignation be accomplished; for that which is determined shall be done. 
\v 37 Neither will he regard the god of his fathers, nor the desire of women; nor will he regard any god, but he will magnify himself against all. 
\v 38 But in their place will he honor the god of strongholds, even the god whom his fathers knew not shall he honor with gold, and with silver, and with precious stones, and with jewels. 
\v 39 And he shall do his will against fenced strongholds with a strange god; whoever acknowledge him, to them he will give great honor, and give them dominion over many, and divide the land amongst them for a reward. 
\v 40 But at the time of the end shall the king of the South push at him, and the king of the North shall rush against him like a whirlwind with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and overflow them, and pass over them. 
\v 41 He shall also enter into the beautiful land, and multitudes shall be overthrown; but these shall escape out of his hand, Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the sons of Ammon. 
\v 42 He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries, and the land of Egypt shall not escape. 
\v 43 And he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt; and the Lybians and Ethiopians shall be in his train. 
\v 44 But tidings out of the East and out of the North shall trouble him, and he shall go forth with great fury to destroy and utterly to take away many. 
\v 45 And he shall pitch his palace-tents between the sea and the beautiful holy mountain; but he shall come to his end, and none shall help him.

\v 1 And at that time shall Michael arise, the great prince that standeth up for the sons of thy people; and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that time; and at that time shall thy people be delivered, every one that is found written in the book. 
\v 2 And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame, to everlasting contempt. 
\v 3 And they that are wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn the many to righteousness, as the stars for ever and ever. 
\v 4 But thou, Daniel, shut up these words, and seal this book even to the time of the end. Many shall run eagerly through it, and much knowledge shall be gained. 
\v 5 And I Daniel looked, and behold, two others stood there, one on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on that side of the bank of the river. 
\v 6 And one of them said to the man clothed in linen, who was upon the waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders? 
\v 7 And I heard the man clothed in linen, who was upon the waters of the river, and he lifted up his right hand and his left hand to heaven, and swore by Him that liveth forever, that in a time, times, and a half, even when the dispersion of a portion of the holy people should be at an end, all these things should be fulfilled. 
\v 8 And I heard but understood not; and I said, My lord, what is the latter end of these things? 
\v 9 And he said, Go thy way, Daniel, for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end. 
\v 10 Many shall be cleansed, and made white, and purified, and the wicked will do wickedly; and none of the wicked will understand, but the wise will understand. 
\v 11 And from the time when the daily sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination of the destroyer set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days. 
\v 12 Happy is he that waiteth and cometh to a thousand three hundred and thirty-five days! 
\v 13 But go thou thy way even to the end; for thou shalt rest, and rise up to thy lot at the end of the days.
