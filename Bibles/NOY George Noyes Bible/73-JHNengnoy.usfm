\mt1 THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST. JOHN 
\c 1  
\p
\v 1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 
\v 2 The same was in the beginning with God. 
\v 3 All things were made through him; and without him was nothing made that hath been made. 
\v 4 In him is life; and the life was the light of men. 
\v 5 And the light hath been shining in the darkness; and the darkness received it not. 
\v 6 There was a man, sent from God, whose name was John. 
\v 7 He came as a witness, to bear witness of the light, that through him all might believe. 
\v 8 He was not the light, but came to bear witness of the light. 
\v 9 The true light, which enlighteneth every man, was coming into the world. 
\v 10 He was in the world, and the world was made through him, and the world knew him not. 
\v 11 He came to his own, and his own received him not. 
\v 12 But as many as received him, to them he gave power to become children of God,—to those who believed in his name; 
\v 13 who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. 
\v 14 And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth; and we beheld his glory, a glory as of an only begotten of a father. 
\v 15 John beareth witness of him, and crieth, saying, This was he of whom I said, He that cometh after me hath gone before me; for he was before me. 
\v 16 For out of his fullness have we all received, and grace upon grace. 
\v 17 For the Law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. 
\v 18 No one hath ever seen God; the only begotten God, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath made him known. 
\v 19 And this is the witness of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem, to ask him, Who art thou? 
\v 20 And he declared, and did not deny; and he declared, I am not the Christ. 
\v 21 And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elijah? And he said, I am not. Art thou the prophet? And he answered, No. 
\v 22 They said therefore to him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to those who sent us; what sayest thou of thyself? 
\v 23 He said, I am “a voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord,” as said Isaiah the prophet. 
\v 24 And they were sent from the Pharisees; 
\v 25 and they asked him and said to him, Why then dost thou baptize, if thou art not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet? 
\v 26 John answered them, saying, I baptize in water. There standeth one among you whom ye know not, 
\v 27 he who cometh after me, the latchet of whose sandal I am not worthy to loose. 
\v 28 These things took place in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing. 
\v 29 The next day he seeth Jesus coming to him, and saith, Behold, the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the world! 
\v 30 This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man, who hath gone before me; for he was before me. 
\v 31 And I knew him not; but that he might be made manifest to Israel, therefore I came baptizing in water. 
\v 32 And John bore witness, saying, I have seen the Spirit descending as a dove from heaven, and it abode upon him. 
\v 33 And I knew him not; but he who sent me to baptize in water, the same said to me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, he it is that baptizeth in the Holy Spirit. 
\v 34 And I have seen and have borne witness, that this is the Son of God. 
\v 35 On the morrow John was again standing, and two of his disciples; 
\v 36 and looking upon Jesus as he was walking, he saith, Behold, the Lamb of God! 
\v 37 The two disciples heard him speaking, and they followed Jesus. 
\v 38 Jesus turning and seeing them following, saith to them, What seek ye? And they said to him, Rabbi, (that is to say, when interpreted, Teacher,) where dost thou dwell? 
\v 39 He saith to them, Come, and ye shall see. They came therefore and saw where he dwelt; and they abode with him that day. It was about the tenth hour. 
\v 40 One of the two who heard what John said, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. 
\v 41 He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith to him, We have found the Messiah; (which is, when interpreted, the Christ.) 
\v 42 He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looking upon him said, Thou art Simon, the son of John; thou shalt be called Cephas; (which signifieth Peter, that is, Rock.) 
\v 43 On the morrow he determined to go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip. And Jesus saith to him, Follow me. 
\v 44 Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. 
\v 45 Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith to him, We have found him of whom Moses in the Law, and the Prophets wrote, Jesus, the son of Joseph, who is of Nazareth. 
\v 46 And Nathanael said to him, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith to him, Come and see. 
\v 47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile. 
\v 48 Nathanael saith to him, Whence dost thou know me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee. 
\v 49 Nathanael answered him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, thou art the king of Israel. 
\v 50 Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to thee, I saw thee under the fig-tree, dost thou believe? Thou shalt see greater things than these. 
\v 51 And he saith to him, Truly, truly do I say to you, Ye will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.

\v 1 And on the third day there was a marriage-feast in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there. 
\v 2 And both Jesus and his disciples were invited to the feast. 
\v 3 And they had no wine, because the wine of the feast had failed. Then the mother of Jesus saith to him, There is no wine. 
\v 4 Jesus saith to her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? My hour is not yet come. 
\v 5 His mother saith to the servants, Whatever he saith to you, do it. 
\v 6 Now there were set there six water-pots of stone, in conformity with the Jews' custom of purifying, containing two or three firkins apiece. 
\v 7 Jesus saith to them, Fill the water-pots with water. And they filled them up to the brim. 
\v 8 And he saith to them, Draw out now, and bear it to the master of the feast. And they bore it. 
\v 9 But when the master of the feast tasted the water that had been made wine, not knowing whence it was, but the servants who drew the water knew, he called the bridegroom 
\v 10 and said to him, Every man setteth on the good wine first, and when men have drunk freely, that which is worse. Thou hast kept the good wine until now. 
\v 11 This beginning of the signs Jesus made in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed in him. 
\v 12 After this he went down to Capernaum, he and his mother, and his brothers, and his disciples; and they abode there not many days. 
\v 13 And the passover of the Jews was near; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 
\v 14 And he found in the temple those who sold oxen, and sheep, and doves, and the money-changers sitting. 
\v 15 And having made a scourge of cords, he drove them all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and poured out the money of the exchangers, and overthrew the tables; 
\v 16 and said to those who sold the doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house a house of merchandise. 
\v 17 His disciples remembered that it was written, “Zeal for thy house will consume me.” 
\v 18 The Jews therefore answered and said to him, What sign dost thou show us, seeing thou doest these things? 
\v 19 Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. 
\v 20 Then said the Jews, Forty-six years was this temple in building; and wilt thou raise it up in three days? 
\v 21 But he spoke of the temple of his body. 
\v 22 When therefore he had risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this; and they believed the Scripture, and the word which Jesus had spoken. 
\v 23 And when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, at the feast, many believed in his name, when they saw his signs which he wrought. 
\v 24 But Jesus did not trust himself to them, because he knew all men; 
\v 25 and had no need that any one should testify concerning man; for he himself knew what was in man. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 And there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. 
\v 2 This man came to him by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that thou hast come as a teacher from God; for no one can do these signs which thou doest, unless God be with him. 
\v 3 Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly do I say to thee, Unless a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. 
\v 4 Nicodemus saith to him, How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter his mother's womb a second time, and be born? 
\v 5 Jesus answered, Truly, truly do I say to thee, Unless a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of heaven. 
\v 6 That which is born of the flesh, is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit, is spirit. 
\v 7 Marvel not that I said to thee, Ye must be born again. 
\v 8 The wind bloweth where it will; and thou hearest the sound thereof, but knowest not whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit. 
\v 9 Nicodemus answered and said to him, How can these things be? 
\v 10 Jesus answered and said to him, Art thou the teacher of Israel, and understandest not these things? 
\v 11 Truly, truly do I say to thee, We speak that which we know, and testify that which we have seen; and ye receive not our testimony. 
\v 12 If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how will ye believe if I tell you heavenly things? 
\v 13 And no one hath ascended into heaven, but he who came down from heaven, even the Son of man. 
\v 14 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of man be lifted up 
\v 15 that every one who believeth in him may have everlasting life. 
\v 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave the only begotten Son, that every one who believeth in him may not perish, but may have everlasting life. 
\v 17 For God sent not the Son into the world to condemn the world, but that through him the world might be saved. 
\v 18 He that believeth in him is not condemned; he that believeth not hath already been condemned, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. 
\v 19 And this is the condemnation, that the light hath come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their deeds were evil. 
\v 20 For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, and cometh not to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. 
\v 21 But he that doeth the truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God. 
\v 22 After these things Jesus and his disciples came into the land of Judaea; and there he remained with them, and baptized. 
\v 23 And John also was baptizing in AEnon, near Salim, because there was much water there; and they came, and were baptized. 
\v 24 For John was not yet thrown into prison. 
\v 25 Then there arose a question on the part of John's disciples with a Jew about purifying. 
\v 26 And they came to John, and said to him, Rabbi, he who was with thee beyond the Jordan, to whom thou hast borne witness, behold, he baptizeth, and all men are going to him. 
\v 27 John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, unless it be given him from heaven. 
\v 28 Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I was sent before that man. 
\v 29 He that hath the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice. This my joy then hath become full. 
\v 30 He must increase, but I must decrease. 
\v 31 He that cometh from above is above all. He that is from the earth is earthly, and speaketh earthly things; he that cometh from heaven 
\v 32 testifieth what he hath seen and heard; and no one receiveth his testimony. 
\v 33 He that hath received his testimony hath set his seal that God is true. 
\v 34 For he whom God sent speaketh the words of God; for he giveth not the Spirit by measure. 
\v 35 The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand. 
\v 36 He that believeth in the Son hath everlasting life; and he that disobeyeth the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.

\p
\v 1 When therefore Jesus knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John, 
\v 2 (though Jesus himself did not baptize, but his disciples,) 
\v 3 he left Judaea, and went again to Galilee. 
\v 4 And he must necessarily pass through Samaria. 
\v 5 He cometh therefore to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near the piece of land which Jacob gave to his son Joseph. 
\v 6 And Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with the journey, was sitting thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour. 
\v 7 There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus saith to her, Give me to drink. 
\v 8 For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food. 
\v 9 The Samaritan woman saith to him, How is it that thou, who art a Jew, askest drink of me, who am a Samaritan woman? For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans. 
\v 10 Jesus answered and said to her, If thou hadst known the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldst have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. 
\v 11 The woman saith to him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. Whence hast thou the living water? 
\v 12 Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his sons, and his cattle? 
\v 13 Jesus answered and said to her, Every one that drinketh of this water, will thirst again; 
\v 14 but whoever drinketh of the water that I will give him, will never thirst; but the water that I will give him will become within him a well of water springing up to everlasting life. 
\v 15 The woman saith to him, Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come hither to draw. 
\v 16 He saith to her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither. 
\v 17 The woman answered, I have no husband. Jesus saith to her, Thou saidst well, that thou hast no husband. 
\v 18 For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband; in this thou hast spoken truly. 
\v 19 The woman saith to him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. 
\v 20 Our fathers worshipped on this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. 
\v 21 Jesus saith to her, Believe me, woman, the hour is coming, when ye shall neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, worship the Father. 
\v 22 Ye worship that which ye know not; we worship that which we know; for salvation is from the Jews. 
\v 23 But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth; for such worshippers the Father seeketh. 
\v 24 God is a spirit; and they who worship must worship in spirit and in truth. 
\v 25 The woman saith to him, I know that Messiah cometh (who is called Christ); when he hath come, he will tell us all things. 
\v 26 Jesus saith to her, I who speak to thee am he. 
\v 27 And upon this his disciples came, and marveled that he was talking with a woman. Yet no one said, What dost thou seek? or, Why dost thou talk with her? 
\v 28 The woman then left her water-pot, and went away into the city, and saith to the men, 
\v 29 Come, see a man who told me all things which I have done. Is this the Christ? 
\v 30 They went out of the city, and came to him. 
\v 31 In the mean while the disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, eat. 
\v 32 But he said to them, I have food to eat that ye know not of. 
\v 33 The disciples therefore said to one another, Hath any one brought him anything to eat? 
\v 34 Jesus saith to them, My food is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work. 
\v 35 Do ye not say, There are yet four months, and the harvest cometh? Lo! I say to you, lift up your eyes, and look on the fields, that they are white for harvest. 
\v 36 Already is the reaper receiving wages, and gathering fruit unto everlasting life; that both the sower and the reaper may rejoice together. 
\v 37 And herein is fulfilled the true saying, One soweth, and another reapeth. 
\v 38 I have sent you to reap that whereon ye have not labored. Others have labored, and ye have entered into their labor. 
\v 39 And many of the Samaritans of that city believed in him because of the words of the woman, who testified, He told me all things which I have done. 
\v 40 When therefore the Samaritans came to him, they besought him to remain with them; and he remained there two days. 
\v 41 And many more believed on account of his word; 
\v 42 and said to the woman, No longer do we believe on account of what thou hast told us; for we have ourselves heard him, and know that this is in truth the Saviour of the world. 
\v 43 And after the two days he went from that place into Galilee. 
\v 44 For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honor in his own country. 
\v 45 When therefore he came into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all that he did in Jerusalem at the feast; for they also went to the feast. 
\v 46 So he came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick, at Capernaum. 
\v 47 He, having heard that Jesus had come out of Judaea into Galilee, went to him, and asked him to go down and heal his son; for he was at the point of death. 
\v 48 Then Jesus said to him, Unless ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe. 
\v 49 The nobleman saith to him, Sir, come down before my child die. 
\v 50 Jesus saith to him, Go; thy son liveth. The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and went away. 
\v 51 And as he was now going down, the servants met him, and brought word that his child was living. 
\v 52 Then he inquired of them the hour when he began to mend. And they said to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. 
\v 53 So the father knew that it was in the same hour in which Jesus said to him, Thy son is living. And he himself believed, and his whole house. 
\v 54 This again, a second sign, Jesus wrought, when he had come out of Judaea into Galilee. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 After these things there was the feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 
\v 2 Now there is at Jerusalem, by the sheep-gate, a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethzatha, having five porches. 
\v 3 In these were lying a multitude of diseased persons, blind, lame, withered. 
\v 4  
\v 5 And a certain man was there, who had had his infirmity thirty-eight years. 
\v 6 Jesus saw this man lying there, and knowing that he had been for a long time diseased, saith to him, Dost thou wish to be made well? 
\v 7 The diseased man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool; but while I am coming, another goeth down before me. 
\v 8 Jesus saith to him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk. 
\v 9 And immediately the man was made well, and took up his bed, and walked. And that day was the sabbath. 
\v 10 The Jews therefore said to him that was cured, It is the sabbath; and it is not lawful for thee to take up the bed. 
\v 11 He answered them, He that made me well, the same said to me, Take up thy bed, and walk. T 
\v 12 hey asked him, Who is the man that said to thee, Take up, and walk? 
\v 13 But the diseased man knew not who it was; for Jesus had withdrawn himself, there being a crowd in the place. 
\v 14 Afterwards Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him, Behold, thou art made well; sin no more, lest something worse befall thee. 
\v 15 The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well. 
\v 16 And on this account the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he did these things on the sabbath. 
\v 17 But he answered them, My Father is working up to this time, and I work. 
\v 18 On this account the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only broke the sabbath, but also said that God was his own Father, making himself equal with God. 
\v 19 Then answered Jesus and said to them, Truly, truly do I say to you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father doing; for whatever He doeth, these things the Son also doeth in like manner; 
\v 20 for the Father loveth the Son, and showeth him all things which he himself doeth; and greater works than these will he show him, so that ye will wonder. 
\v 21 For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and giveth them life, so the Son also giveth life to whom he will. 
\v 22 For neither doth the Father judge any one, but hath committed all judgment to the Son; 
\v 23 that all may honor the Son, as they honor the Father. He that honoreth not the Son, honoreth not the Father, who sent him. 
\v 24 Truly, truly do I say to you, He that heareth my word, and believeth him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and cometh not into condemnation, but hath passed out of death into life. 
\v 25 Truly, truly do I say to you, The hour is coming and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear will live. 
\v 26 For as the Father hath life in himself, so did he give to the Son also to have life in himself. 
\v 27 And he gave him authority to execute judgment, because he is a son of man. 
\v 28 Marvel not at this; for the hour is coming, in which all that are in the tombs will hear his voice, 
\v 29 and will come forth, they that have done good, to a resurrection of life; they that have done evil, to a resurrection of condemnation. 
\v 30 I can of myself do nothing. As I hear, I judge; and my judgment is just, because I seek not my own will, but the will of him that sent me. 
\v 31 If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true. 
\v 32 There is another who beareth witness of me; and ye know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true. 
\v 33 Ye have sent to John, and he hath borne witness to the truth. 
\v 34 But the testimony which I receive is not from man; but these things I say, that ye may be saved. 
\v 35 He was the burning and shining lamp: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light. 
\v 36 But the testimony which I have, is greater than that of John; for the works which the Father hath given me to perform, the works themselves which I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me. 
\v 37 And the Father who sent me, he hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form. 
\v 38 And ye have not his word abiding in you; for whom he sent, him ye believe not. 
\v 39 Ye search the Scriptures, because ye yourselves think that in them ye have everlasting life; and it is they which testify of me; 
\v 40 and ye are not willing to come to me, that ye may have life. 
\v 41 I receive not honor from men; 
\v 42 but I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you. 
\v 43 I have come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not; if another come in his own name, him ye will receive. 
\v 44 How can ye believe while ye receive honor from one another, and seek not the honor that is from him who alone is God? 
\v 45 Do not think that I shall accuse you to the Father; there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye have placed your hope. 
\v 46 For if ye believed Moses, ye would believe me; for he wrote of me. 
\v 47 But if ye do not believe his writings, how will ye believe my words? 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1 After these things Jesus went away across the lake of Galilee, that of Tiberias. 
\v 2 And a great multitude followed him, because they saw the signs which he wrought on the diseased. 
\v 3 And Jesus went up into the mountain, and sat there with his disciples. 
\v 4 And the passover, the feast of the Jews, was near. 
\v 5 Jesus then lifting up his eyes, and seeing that a great crowd was coming to him, saith to Philip, Whence are we to buy bread, that these may eat? 
\v 6 But this he said to try him; for he himself knew what he was going to do. 
\v 7 Philip answered him, Two hundred denaries' worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that each one may take a tittle. 
\v 8 One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith to him, 
\v 9 There is a lad here, who hath five barley-loaves, and two small fishes; but what are they among so many? 
\v 10 Jesus said, Make the men lie down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men lay down, in number about five thousand. 
\v 11 Jesus then took the loaves, and having given thanks, distributed to those that were lying down; in like manner also of the fishes, as much as they desired. 
\v 12 And when they were filled, he saith to his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain over, that nothing may be lost. 
\v 13 So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley-loaves, which remained over and above to those that had eaten. 
\v 14 The men therefore seeing the sign which he wrought, said, This is truly the prophet that was to come into the world. 
\v 15 Jesus therefore, knowing that they were about to come and take him by force to make him a king, withdrew again to the mountain alone. 
\v 16 But when evening came, his disciples went down to the lake, 
\v 17 and having gone on board a boat, were going over the lake to Capernaum. And darkness had overtaken them, and Jesus had not yet come to them. 
\v 18 And as a strong wind was blowing, the waves ran high. 
\v 19 When therefore they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty furlongs, they saw Jesus walking on the lake, and drawing near the boat; and they were afraid. 
\v 20 But he saith to them, It is I, be not afraid. 
\v 21 Then they were willing to receive him into the boat; and immediately the boat was at the land whither they were going. 
\v 22 The day following, the multitude which stood on the other side of the lake having seen that there was no other boat there but one, and that Jesus did not go with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples went away alone, 
\v 23 (but there came other boats from Tiberias near the place where they ate the bread, when the Lord had given thanks;) 
\v 24 when therefore the multitude saw that Jesus was not there nor his disciples, they went on board the boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus. 
\v 25 And having found him on the other side of the lake, they said to him, Rabbi, when didst thou come hither? 
\v 26 Jesus answered them and said, Truly, truly do I say to you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw signs, but because ye ate of the loaves, and were filled. 
\v 27 Labor not for the food that perisheth, but for the food that endureth to everlasting life, which the Son of man giveth to you; for on him hath the Father set his seal, even God. 
\v 28 Then they said to him, What are we to do, that we may work the works of God? 
\v 29 Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that ye believe in him whom he sent. 
\v 30 They said therefore to him, What sign doest thou, that we may see, and believe thee? What dost thou work? 
\v 31 Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, as it is written, “He gave them bread from heaven to eat.” 
\v 32 Jesus therefore said to them, Truly, truly do I say to you, Moses hath not given you the bread from heaven; but my Father is giving you the true bread from heaven. 
\v 33 For the bread of God is that which is coming down from heaven, and giving life to the world. 
\v 34 They said therefore to him, Lord, evermore give us this bread. 
\v 35 Jesus therefore said to them, I am the bread of life; he that cometh to me will not hunger; and he that believeth in me will never thirst. 
\v 36 But I said to you, that ye have even seen, and do not believe. 
\v 37 All that the Father giveth me will come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out; 
\v 38 for I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me. 
\v 39 And this is the will of him that sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up in the last day. 
\v 40 For this is the will of my Father, that every one who looketh on the Son and believeth in him, shall have everlasting life; and I will raise him up in the last day. 
\v 41 The Jews therefore murmured about him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven; 
\v 42 and they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, one whose father and mother we know? How is it then that this man saith, I have come down from heaven? 
\v 43 Jesus therefore answered and said to them, Murmur not among yourselves. 
\v 44 No one can come to me, unless the Father, who sent me, draw him: and I will raise him up in the last day. 
\v 45 It is written in the prophets, “And they shall all be taught of God.” Every one that hath heard the Father, and hath learnt from him, cometh to me. 
\v 46 Not that any one hath seen the Father, but he who is from God; he hath seen the Father. 
\v 47 Truly, truly do I say to you, He that believeth hath everlasting life. 
\v 48 I am the bread of life. 
\v 49 Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and died. 
\v 50 This is the bread which is coming down from heaven, that one may eat of it and not die. 
\v 51 I am the living bread which came down from heaven; if any one eat of my bread, he will live for ever. Yea, and the bread which I will give for the life of the world is my flesh. 
\v 52 The Jews therefore contended with one another, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat? 
\v 53 Jesus therefore said to them, Truly, truly do I say to you, Unless ye eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, ye have no life in you. 
\v 54 He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath everlasting life; and I will raise him up in the last day. 
\v 55 For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink. 
\v 56 He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me, and I in him. 
\v 57 As the living Father sent me, and I live by reason of the Father; so he that eateth me, he also shall live by reason of me. 
\v 58 This is the bread which came down from heaven; not as the fathers ate, and died; he that eateth this bread will live for ever. 
\v 59 These things he said in a synagogue, while teaching in Capernaum. 
\v 60 Many therefore of his disciples, when they heard this, said, This teaching is hard; who can listen to it? 
\v 61 Jesus therefore knew within himself that his disciples were murmuring about this, and said to them, Doth this offend you? 
\v 62 What then if ye behold the Son of man ascending where he was before? 
\v 63 It is the spirit which maketh alive; the flesh profiteth nothing. The words which I have spoken to you are spirit, and are life. 
\v 64 But there are some of you who do not believe. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that did not believe, and who it was that would betray him. 
\v 65 And he said, For this cause I have told you, that no one can come to me, unless it hath been given him from the Father. 
\v 66 From this time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him. 
\v 67 Jesus therefore said to the twelve, Do ye also wish to go away? 
\v 68 Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast words of everlasting life; 
\v 69 and we have believed and known, that thou art the Holy One of God. 
\v 70 Jesus answered them, Did not I choose you twelve? and one of you is a devil! 
\v 71 He spoke of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot; for it was he that was about to betray him, being one of the twelve. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1 After these things Jesus walked in Galilee; for he would not walk in Judaea, because the Jews sought to kill him. 
\v 2 Now the feast of the Jews, the feast of tabernacles, was at hand. 
\v 3 His brothers therefore said to him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see thy works which thou art doing. 
\v 4 For no one doeth anything in secret, and yet himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou doest these things, manifest thyself to the world. 
\v 5 For even his brothers did not believe in him. 
\v 6 Jesus saith to them, My time is not yet come; but your time is always ready. 
\v 7 The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that its works are evil. 
\v 8 Go ye up to the feast; I go not up to this feast; for my time is not yet fully come. 
\v 9 Having said these things, he remained in Galilee. 
\v 10 But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not openly, but as it were in secret. 
\v 11 The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, Where is that man? 
\v 12 And there was much debating among the multitude concerning him. Some said, He is a good man; others said, Nay, but he deceiveth the multitude. 
\v 13 No one, however, spoke openly of him, for fear of the Jews. 
\v 14 But when it was now the midst of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught. 
\v 15 The Jews therefore marveled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned? 
\v 16 Jesus therefore answered them, and said, My teaching is not mine, but his that sent me. 
\v 17 If any one is desirous to do his will, he will know concerning the teaching, whether it is from God, or whether I speak from myself. 
\v 18 He that speaketh from himself seeketh his own glory; but he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him, he is true, and in him is no unrighteousness. 
\v 19 Hath not Moses given you the Law? and none of you keepeth the Law! Why do ye seek to kill me? 
\v 20 The multitude answered, Thou hast a demon! Who seeketh to kill thee? 
\v 21 Jesus answered and said to them, I have done one good work, and ye are all wondering. 
\v 22 Moses hath given you circumcision, (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath circumcise a man. 
\v 23 If a man receive circumcision on the sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken, are ye angry at me, because I have restored soundness to the whole body of a man on the sabbath? 
\v 24 Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment. 
\v 25 Then some of the men of Jerusalem said, Is not this he whom they seek to kill? 
\v 26 and see! he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing to him. Have the rulers discovered certainly that this man is the Christ? 
\v 27 Still, as to this man, we know whence he is; but when the Christ cometh, no one knoweth whence he is. 
\v 28 Jesus therefore cried aloud, teaching in the temple and saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am; and I have not come of myself, but there is in truth one who sent me, whom ye know not. 
\v 29 I know him, because I am from him, and he hath sent me. 
\v 30 Therefore they sought to take him; but no one laid hands on him, because his hour had not yet come. 
\v 31 But of the multitude many believed in him, and said, When the Christ cometh, will he do more signs than these which this man doeth? 
\v 32 The Pharisees heard the multitude thus debating concerning him; and the chief priest and the Pharisees sent officers to seize him. 
\v 33 Jesus therefore said, Yet a little while I am with you, and then I go to him that sent me. 
\v 34 Ye will seek me and not find me; and where I am, ye cannot come. 
\v 35 The Jews therefore said among themselves, Whither will this man go, that we shall not find him? Will he go to the dispersed among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks? 
\v 36 What meaneth this which he said, Ye will seek me, and not find me; and where I am, ye cannot come? 
\v 37 On the last day, which is the great day, of the feast, Jesus stood and cried aloud, saying, If any one thirst, let him come to me, and drink. 
\v 38 He that believeth in me, from within him, as the Scripture hath said, will flow rivers of living water. 
\v 39 But this he said of the Spirit, which those that believed in him were to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified. 
\v 40 Some of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, This is in truth the prophet. Others said, This is the Christ. 
\v 41 Others said, Doth the Christ then come from Galilee? 
\v 42 Hath not the Scripture said, that the Christ cometh from the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the town where David was? 
\v 43 So there was a division among the multitude because of him. 
\v 44 And some of them wished to seize him; but no one laid hands on him. 
\v 45 The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees, who said to them, Why did ye not bring him? 
\v 46 The officers answered, Never man spoke like this man. 
\v 47 The Pharisees answered them, Have ye also been deceived? 
\v 48 Hath any one of the rulers believed in him? or of the Pharisees? 
\v 49 but this multitude that know not the Law are accursed. 
\v 50 Nicodemus saith to them, being one of them, 
\v 51 Doth our law judge a man, unless it first hear from him, and know what he doeth? 
\v 52 They answered and said to him, Art thou too from Galilee? Search and see that no prophet ariseth from Galilee. 
\v 53 {Joh 7:53 - 8:12: This passage is omitted as ungenuine by Tischendorf and most critical editors of the Greek Testament. It is found in some manuscripts, but not in the most ancient. It is, however, very generally regarded as a genuine relic of the teaching of Christ, though not forming a part of the fourth Gospel. I give it in the text of Tregelles, omitting the words which he incloses in brackets. Tregelles, however, does not suppose it to be genuine.} [[And they went each to his house; 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1 but Jesus went to the mount of Olives. 
\v 2 And early in the morning he came again to the temple, and all the people were coming to him. And he sat down and taught them. 
\v 3 And the scribes and the Pharisees bring to him a woman taken in adultery; and having set her in the midst, 
\v 4 they say to him, Teacher, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act. 
\v 5 Now in the Law Moses commanded us to stone such persons; what then dost thou say? 
\v 6 But this they said to try him, that they might be able to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground. 
\v 7 But when they continued asking him, he lifted himself up, and said to them, Let him that is without sin among you first cast a stone at her. 
\v 8 And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground. 
\v 9 And when they heard this, they went out one by one, beginning with the oldest; and Jesus was left alone, and the woman who was in the midst. 
\v 10 And Jesus lifted himself up and said to her, Woman, where are they? Did no one condemn thee! 
\v 11 And she said, No one, Lord. And Jesus said, neither do I condemn thee; go, and sin no more. 
\v 12 Again therefore Jesus spoke to them, saying, I am the light of the world; he that followeth me shall not walk in the darkness, but shall have the light of life.]] 
\v 13 The Pharisees therefore said to him, Thou bearest witness of thyself; thy witness is not true. 
\v 14 Jesus answered and said to them, Though I bear witness of myself, my witness is true; for I know whence I came, and whither I go; ye know not whence I come, or whither I go. 
\v 15 Ye judge according to the flesh; I judge no one. 
\v 16 But even if I myself should judge, my judgment is true, because I am not alone, but I and he who sent me. 
\v 17 Moreover, it is written in your law, that the witness of two men is true. 
\v 18 I am one who bear witness of myself, and the Father who sent me beareth witness of me. 
\v 19 They said therefore to him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye know neither me, nor my Father. If ye knew me, ye would know my Father also. 
\v 20 These words he spoke in the treasury, while teaching in the temple; and no one laid hands on him, because his hour had not yet come. 
\v 21 Again therefore he said to them, I go away, and ye will seek me, and will die in your sin. Whither I go, ye cannot come. 
\v 22 The Jews therefore said, Will he kill himself, that he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come? 
\v 23 And he said to them, Ye are from beneath, I am from above; ye are of this world, I am not of this world. 
\v 24 Therefore I said to you, that ye will die in your sins; for unless ye believe that I am He, ye will die in your sins. 
\v 25 They said therefore to him, Who art thou? Jesus said to them, In the first place, I am just that which I speak to you. 
\v 26 I have many things to say, and to judge, concerning you; but he who sent me is true; and I speak to the world what I heard from him. 
\v 27 They understood not that he spoke to them of the Father. 
\v 28 Jesus therefore said, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then ye will know that I am He, and do nothing of myself, but speak these things as the Father taught me. 
\v 29 And he that sent me is with me; he hath not left me alone, for I always do the things that please him. 
\v 30 As he spoke these words, many believed in him. 
\v 31 Jesus therefore said to those Jews who believed in him, If ye continue in my word, ye are truly my disciples; 
\v 32 and ye will know the truth, and the truth will make you free. 
\v 33 They answered him, We are Abraham's offspring, and have never been in bondage to any one; how sayest, thou, Ye will be made free? 
\v 34 Jesus answered them, Truly, truly do I say to you, Every one that committeth sin is a bond-servant of sin. 
\v 35 And the bond-servant abideth not in the house for ever; the son abideth for ever. 
\v 36 If therefore the Son make you free, ye will be free indeed. 
\v 37 I know that ye are Abraham's offspring; but ye seek to kill me, because my word is not received within you. 
\v 38 I speak what I have seen with the Father; and ye accordingly do what ye have seen with your father. 
\v 39 They answered and said to him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith to them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham. 
\v 40 But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath spoken to you the truth, which I heard from God; this did not Abraham. 
\v 41 Ye do the works of your father. They said to him, We were not born of fornication; we have one Father, God. 
\v 42 Jesus said to them, If God were your father, ye would love me; for from God I proceeded forth and am come; neither came I of myself, but he sent me. 
\v 43 Why do ye not understand my language? It is because ye cannot listen to my word. 
\v 44 Ye are of your father the Devil, and what your father desireth ye are ready to do. He was a murderer from the beginning; and he abideth not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh from his own nature; for he is a liar, and the father of it. 
\v 45 But because I speak the truth, ye believe me not. 
\v 46 Which of you convicteth me of sin? If I speak truth, Why do ye not believe me? 
\v 47 He that is of God heareth God's words; for this cause ye do not hear, because ye are not of God. 
\v 48 The Jews answered and said to him, Say we not well, that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a demon? 
\v 49 Jesus answered, I have not a demon, but I honor my Father, and ye dishonor me. 
\v 50 But I seek not my own glory; there is one that seeketh and judgeth. 
\v 51 Truly, truly do I say to you, If any one keep my word, he will never see death. 
\v 52 The Jews said to him, Now we know that thou hast a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If any one keep my word, he will never taste of death. 
\v 53 Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who died? The prophets also died. Whom dost thou make thyself? 
\v 54 Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father that glorifieth me, of whom ye say, He is our God: 
\v 55 yet ye know him not; but I know him. And if I should say, I know him not, I should be a liar like you. But I know him, and keep his word. 
\v 56 Your father Abraham exulted that he might see my day; and he saw it, and was glad. 
\v 57 The Jews therefore said to him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham? 
\v 58 Jesus said to them, Truly, truly do I say to you, From before Abraham was, I have been. 
\v 59 They therefore took up stones to throw at him; but Jesus concealed himself, and went out of the temple. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 And as he was passing along, he saw a man who had been blind from his birth. 
\v 2 And his disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, who sinned, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind? 
\v 3 Jesus answered, Neither did this man sin, nor his parents; but that the works of God might be made manifest in him. 
\v 4 We must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day; the night is coming, when no one can work. 
\v 5 As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world. 
\v 6 Having thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay with the spittle, and anointed his eyes with the clay, 
\v 7 and said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam; (which is, when translated, Sent.) He went away therefore, and washed and came seeing. 
\v 8 The neighbors therefore, and they who before had seen him as a beggar, said, Is not this he that sits and begs? 
\v 9 Some said, This is he. Others said, No, but he is like him. He said, I am he. 
\v 10 They said therefore to him How then were thine eyes opened? 
\v 11 He answered, The man who is called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes, and said to me, Go to Siloam, and wash. I went therefore and washed, and received sight. 
\v 12 And they said to him, Where is that man? He saith, I do not know. 
\v 13 They bring to the Pharisees him who had once been blind. 
\v 14 And the day on which Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes was the sabbath. 
\v 15 Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. He said to them, He put clay on my eyes, and I washed them, and I see. 
\v 16 Therefore some of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because he keepeth not the sabbath. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such signs. And there was a division among them. 
\v 17 They say therefore to the blind man again, What dost thou say of him for having opened thine eyes? And he said, He is a prophet. 
\v 18 The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight. 
\v 19 And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? How then doth he now see? 
\v 20 His parents, answered and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind; 
\v 21 but by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who opened his eyes, we know not; ask him, he is of age; he will speak for himself. 
\v 22 This his parents said, because they feared the Jews. For the Jews had already agreed, that if any one should acknowledge him as the Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue. 
\v 23 Therefore his parents said, He is of age; ask him. 
\v 24 They therefore called a second time the man that had been blind, and said to him, Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner. 
\v 25 He therefore answered, Whether he is a sinner, I know not; one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see. 
\v 26 They said to him, What did he do to thee? How did he open thine eyes? 
\v 27 He answered them, I have already told you, and ye did not hear; why would ye hear it again? Are ye also inclined to become his disciples? 
\v 28 They reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are disciples of Moses. 
\v 29 We know that God hath spoken to Moses; but as for this man, we know not whence he is. 
\v 30 The man answered and said to them, Why, herein is a marvelous thing, that ye know not whence he is, and yet he opened my eyes. 
\v 31 We know that God heareth not sinners; but if any one is a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth. 
\v 32 Since the world began, it was never heard that any one opened the eyes of a man born blind. 
\v 33 If this man were not from God, he could do nothing. 
\v 34 They answered and said to him, Thou wast wholly born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out. 
\v 35 Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and he found him, and said, Dost thou believe in the Son of man? 
\v 36 He answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him? 
\v 37 Jesus said to him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee. 
\v 38 And he said, I believe, Lord; and he prostrated himself before him. 
\v 39 And Jesus said, For judgment came I into this world; that they who see not might see, and that they who see might become blind. 
\v 40 Some of the Pharisees who were with him heard this, and said to him, Are we also blind? 
\v 41 Jesus said to them, If ye were blind, ye would not have sin; but now ye say, We see. Your sin remaineth. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1 Truly, truly do I say to you, He that entereth not through the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber; 
\v 2 but he that entereth through the door is the shepherd of the sheep. 
\v 3 To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice; and his own sheep he calleth by name, and leadeth them out. 
\v 4 When he hath put forth all his own, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him, because they know his voice. 
\v 5 But a stranger they will not follow, but will flee from him; because they know not the voice of strangers. 
\v 6 This parable Jesus spoke to them; but they did not understand what the things were which he spoke to them. 
\v 7 Jesus therefore said, Truly, truly do I say to you, I am the door of the sheep. 
\v 8 All those who came are thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not hear them. 
\v 9 I am the door; if any one enter through me, he will be saved, and will go in and out, and find pasture. 
\v 10 The thief cometh not but to steal, and to kill, and to destroy; I came that they might have life, and have abundance. 
\v 11 I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep. 
\v 12 He that is a hireling and not a shepherd, nor the owner of the sheep, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth; and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep; 
\v 13 because he is a hireling, and careth not for the sheep. 
\v 14 I am the good shepherd, and I know my sheep, and they know me, 
\v 15 even as the Father knoweth me, and I know the Father; and I give my life for the sheep. 
\v 16 And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold; them also I must bring; and they will hear my voice, and there will be one flock, one shepherd. 
\v 17 On this account the Father loveth me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it again. 
\v 18 No one taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it again; this charge I received from my Father. 
\v 19 Again there arose a division among the Jews on account of these words. 
\v 20 Many of them said, He hath a demon, and is mad; why do ye hear him? 
\v 21 Others said, These are not the words of one that hath a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind? 
\v 22 And the feast of the dedication came at Jerusalem. It was winter; 
\v 23 and Jesus was walking in the temple, in Solomon's porch. 
\v 24 Then came the Jews around him, and said to him, How long dost thou hold our minds in suspense? If thou art the Christ, tell us plainly. 
\v 25 Jesus answered them, I have told you, and ye do not believe. The works that I do in my Father's name, these bear witness of me. 
\v 26 But ye do not believe, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said to you. 
\v 27 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me; 
\v 28 and I give them everlasting life; and they shall never perish, nor shall any one tear them out of my hand. 
\v 29 That which my Father hath given me is greater than all; and no one is able to tear [[them]] out of the Father's hand. 
\v 30 I and the Father are one. 
\v 31 The Jews again took up stones to stone him. 
\v 32 Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shown you from the Father; for which of those works do ye stone me? 
\v 33 The Jews answered him, Not for a good work do we stone thee, but for blasphemy, and because thou, who art a man, makest thyself God. 
\v 34 Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your Law, “I said, ye are gods”? 
\v 35 If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came, and the Scripture cannot be made void, 
\v 36 say ye of him whom the Father sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God? 
\v 37 If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not. 
\v 38 But if I do them, though ye believe not me, believe the works; that ye may learn and know that the Father is in me, and I in the Father. 
\v 39 They sought therefore to seize him; and he went forth out of their hands. 
\v 40 And he went away again beyond the Jordan, to the place where John was at first baptizing; and there he abode. 
\v 41 And many came to him, and said, John indeed wrought no sign; but everything that John said of this man was true. 
\v 42 And many believed in him there. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 But there was a certain man sick, Lazarus of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha. 
\v 2 It was the Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick. 
\v 3 The sisters therefore sent to him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick. 
\v 4 And Jesus hearing this said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified through it. 
\v 5 Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. 
\v 6 When therefore he heard that he was sick, he remained in the place where he was two days. 
\v 7 Then after this he saith to the disciples, Let us go into Judaea again. 
\v 8 The disciples say to him, Rabbi, the Jews but just now were seeking to stone thee, and goest thou thither again? 
\v 9 Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If a man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world; 
\v 10 but if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth; because the light is not in him. 
\v 11 This he spoke, and afterwards said to them, Our friend Lazarus hath fallen asleep; but I go that I may awake him out of sleep. 
\v 12 The disciples therefore said to him, Lord, if he hath fallen asleep, he will recover. 
\v 13 But Jesus had spoken of his death; but they thought that he spoke of the taking of rest in sleep. 
\v 14 Then therefore Jesus said to them plainly: Lazarus is dead. 
\v 15 And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there; that ye may believe; but let us go to him. 
\v 16 Then said Thomas, who was called Didymus, to his fellow-disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him. 
\v 17 Having come, therefore, Jesus found that he had been four days in the tomb. 
\v 18 Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off; 
\v 19 and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother. 
\v 20 Martha therefore, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went to meet him; but Mary continued sitting in the house. 
\v 21 Then said Martha to Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died; 
\v 22 and even now I know that whatever thou shalt ask of God, God will give it thee. 
\v 23 Jesus saith to her, Thy brother will rise again. 
\v 24 Martha saith to him, I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day. 
\v 25 Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in me, though he have died, will live; 
\v 26 and whoever liveth and believeth in me will never die. Believest thou this? 
\v 27 She saith to him, Yea, Lord; I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, he who was to come into the world. 
\v 28 And having said this, she went away, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Teacher is here and calleth for thee. 
\v 29 She, when she heard this, riseth quickly and cometh to him. 
\v 30 Now Jesus had not yet come into the town, but was still in the place where Martha met him. 
\v 31 The Jews then who were with her in the house and comforting her, when they saw that Mary rose up hastily and went out, followed her, thinking that she was going to the tomb to weep there. 
\v 32 Then Mary, when she came where Jesus was, as soon as she saw him fell down at his feet, saying to him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. 
\v 33 Jesus therefore when he saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping who came with her, was greatly moved in his spirit, and much troubled, 
\v 34 and said, Where have ye laid him? They say to him, Lord, come and see. 
\v 35 Jesus wept. 
\v 36 The Jews therefore said, See, how he loved him! 
\v 37 But some of them said, Could not he, who opened the eyes of the blind man, have also caused that this man should not have died? 
\v 38 Jesus therefore, again greatly moved within himself, cometh to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay against it. 
\v 39 Jesus saith, Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith to him, Lord, by this time the body is offensive; for he hath been dead four days. 
\v 40 Jesus saith to her, Did I not tell thee, that if thou wouldst believe, thou shouldst see the glory of God? 
\v 41 They therefore took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father! I thank thee that thou hast heard me. 
\v 42 Yet I knew that thou hearest me always; but for the sake of the multitude standing around I said it, that they might believe that thou didst send me. 
\v 43 And having thus spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth! 
\v 44 He that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave-clothes; and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith to them, Loose him, and let him go. 
\v 45 Many of the Jews therefore who had come to Mary, and had seen what he did, believed in him. 
\v 46 But some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them what Jesus had done. 
\v 47 Therefore the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, What are we to do, seeing that this man worketh many signs? 
\v 48 If we thus let him alone, all will believe in him; and the Romans will come, and take away both our place and nation. 
\v 49 And a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high-priest that year, said to them, Ye know nothing at all; 
\v 50 nor do ye consider that it is expedient for us that one man die for the people, and not the whole nation perish. 
\v 51 And this he spoke not from himself; but being high-priest that year he prophesied that Jesus was about to die for the nation; 
\v 52 and not for the nation only, but that he might also gather together in one body the children of God that are scattered abroad. 
\v 53 Therefore from that day forth they consulted together to put him to death. 
\v 54 Jesus therefore no longer walked openly among the Jews, but departed thence to the country near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim, and there abode with the disciples. 
\v 55 And the passover of the Jews was at hand; and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves. 
\v 56 They sought therefore for Jesus, and said one to another, as they stood in the temple, What think ye? that he will not come to the feast? 
\v 57 Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders, that, if any one knew where he was, he should give information, that they might seize him. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 Jesus, therefore, six days before the passover, came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus raised from the dead. 
\v 2 They made therefore a supper for him there, and Martha served; but Lazarus was one of those who reclined at the table with him. 
\v 3 Then Mary, taking a pound of ointment of pure spikenard, very costly, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment. 
\v 4 But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, he who was about to betray him, saith, 
\v 5 Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred denaries, and given to the poor? 
\v 6 And this he said, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and kept the purse, and bore what was put therein. 
\v 7 Then said Jesus, Let her alone, that she may keep it until the day of my burial. 
\v 8 For the poor ye have always with you, but me ye have not always. 
\v 9 The great multitude of the Jews therefore knew that he was there; and they came, not only on account of Jesus, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he raised from the dead. 
\v 10 But the priests consulted together that they might put Lazarus also to death; 
\v 11 because on his account many of the Jews were going away, and believing in Jesus. 
\v 12 On the next day, a great multitude that had come to the feast, hearing that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, 
\v 13 took branches of palm-trees, and went forth to meet him, crying aloud, Hosanna! blessed is he who cometh in the name of the Lord, even the king of Israel! 
\v 14 And Jesus, having found a young ass, sat thereon, as it is written, 
\v 15 “Fear not, daughter of Zion! lo! thy king cometh, sitting on an ass's colt.” 
\v 16 These things his disciples did not understand at the first; but when Jesus had been glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things to him. 
\v 17 The multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead bore witness. 
\v 18 For this cause also the multitude met him, because they had heard that he had wrought, this sign. 
\v 19 The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Ye see that ye effect nothing; o! the world hath gone after him. 
\v 20 Now there were certain Greeks among those who came up to worship at the feast. 
\v 21 These came therefore to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we wish to see Jesus. 
\v 22 Philip goeth and telleth Andrew; Andrew and Philip go and tell Jesus. 
\v 23 But Jesus answereth them, saying, The hour hath come that the Son of man should be glorified. 
\v 24 Truly, truly do I say to you, Unless a grain of wheat fall into the ground and die, itself abideth alone; but if it die, it beareth much fruit. 
\v 25 He that loveth his life loseth it; and he that hateth his life in this world will keep it unto everlasting life. 
\v 26 If any one be a servant to me, let him follow me; and where I am, there also will my servant be; if any one serve me, the Father will honor him. 
\v 27 Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour! But for this cause I came to this hour. 
\v 28 Father, glorify thy name! Then came there a voice from heaven: Yea, I have glorified it, and will glorify it again. 
\v 29 The multitude therefore that stood by, hearing this, said that it thundered. Others said, An angel hath spoken to him. 
\v 30 Jesus answered and said, This voice hath come not for my sake, but for yours. 
\v 31 Now is the judgment of this world; now will the prince of this world be cast out; 
\v 32 and I, if I be lifted up from the earth, shall draw all men to me. 
\v 33 This he said, signifying what kind of death he was to die. 
\v 34 The multitude therefore answered him, We have heard out of the Law that the Christ abideth for ever; how then dost thou say that the Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man? 
\v 35 Jesus therefore said to them, Yet a little while is the light among you. Walk while ye have the light, that darkness may not overtake you; and he that walketh in the darkness knoweth not whither he goeth. 
\v 36 While ye have the light, believe in the light, that ye may become sons of light. These things spoke Jesus, and went away, and hid himself from them. 
\v 37 But though he had wrought so many signs before them, they did not believe in him; 
\v 38 that what was spoken by Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, “Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?” 
\v 39 For this cause they could not believe, because Isaiah said again, 
\v 40 “He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; lest they should see with their eyes, and understand with their heart, and turn from their ways, and I should heal them.” 
\v 41 These things said Isaiah, because he saw his glory, and spoke of him. 
\v 42 Yet even of the rulers many believed in him; but on account of the Pharisees they did not acknowledge him, lest they should be put of the synagogue; 
\v 43 for they loved the glory that is of men more than the glory that is of God. 
\v 44 But Jesus cried aloud, and said, He that believeth in me, believeth not in me, but in him that sent me; 
\v 45 and he that beholdeth me, beholdeth him that sent me. 
\v 46 I have come a light into the world, that whoever believeth in me may not remain in the darkness. 
\v 47 And if any one hear my words, and keep them not, I do not judge him; for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world. 
\v 48 He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him; the word that I have spoken, that will judge him in the last day. 
\v 49 Because I have not spoken from myself; but the Father who sent me hath himself committed to me what I should say, and what I should speak; 
\v 50 and I know that what he hath committed to me is everlasting life. What I speak therefore, I speak as the Father hath directed me. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 Now before the feast of the passover, Jesus, knowing that his hour had come that he should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, loved them unto the end. 
\v 2 And supper being served,—the Devil having already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, to betray him,— 
\v 3 he, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he came forth from God, and was going to God, 
\v 4 riseth from the supper, and layeth aside his garments, and took a towel, and girded himself. 
\v 5 Then he poureth water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded. 
\v 6 So he cometh to Simon Peter; who saith to him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet? 
\v 7 Jesus answered and said to him, What I do thou knowest not now, but thou wilt know hereafter. 
\v 8 Peter saith to him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me. 
\v 9 Simon Peter saith to him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head. 
\v 10 Jesus saith to him, He that hath bathed needeth not to wash himself, but is wholly clean; and ye are clean, but not all. 
\v 11 For he knew who was about to betray him; for this reason he said, Ye are not all clean. 
\v 12 So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and placed himself again at the table, he said to them, Know ye what I have done to you? 
\v 13 Ye call me the Teacher, and the Lord; and ye say well; for so I am. 
\v 14 If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another's feet. 
\v 15 For I have given you an example, that ye also should do as I have done to you. 
\v 16 Truly, truly do I say to you, A servant is not greater than his lord, nor one who is sent greater than he that sent him. 
\v 17 If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them. 
\v 18 I speak not of you all; I know whom I chose; but that the Scripture may be fulfilled, “He that eateth bread with me, hath lifted up his heel against me.” 
\v 19 I tell you now before it hath come to pass, that when it hath come to pass ye may believe that I am He. 
\v 20 Truly, truly do I say to you, He that receiveth whomever I send, receiveth me; and he that receiveth me, receiveth him who sent me. 
\v 21 Having said this, Jesus was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Truly, truly do I say to you, that one of you will betray me. 
\v 22 The disciples therefore looked at one another, doubting of whom he spoke. 
\v 23 There was reclining on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved. 
\v 24 To him therefore Simon Peter maketh a sign, and saith to him, Tell who it is of whom he is speaking. 
\v 25 He, therefore, leaning back on the breast of Jesus, saith to him, Lord, who is it? 
\v 26 Jesus answereth, It is he for whom I shall dip the morsel and give it to him. Having therefore dipped the morsel, he taketh and giveth it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. 
\v 27 And after the morsel, Satan entered into him. Jesus therefore saith to him, What thou doest, do quickly. 
\v 28 Now no one at the table knew for what intent he said this to him. 
\v 29 For some thought, because Judas kept the purse, that Jesus said to him, Buy what we need for the feast; or that he should give something to the poor. 
\v 30 He then, having received the morsel, went out immediately; and it was night. 
\v 31 When therefore he had gone out, Jesus saith, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him. 
\v 32 If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and will immediately glorify him. 
\v 33 My children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye will seek me; and, as I said to the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come, so now I say to you. 
\v 34 A new commandment I give you, that ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. 
\v 35 By this will all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one for another. 
\v 36 Simon Peter saith to him, Lord, whither dost thou go? Jesus answered, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou wilt follow me afterward. 
\v 37 Peter saith to him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thee. 
\v 38 Jesus answereth, Wilt thou lay down thy life for me? Truly, truly do I say to thee, A cock will not crow, till thou hast thrice denied me. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1 Let not your heart be troubled. Have faith in God, and have faith in me. 
\v 2 In my Father's house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you. For I go away to prepare a place for you; 
\v 3 and when I have gone away and prepared a place for you, I will come again, and will take you to myself; that where I am, ye also may be. 
\v 4 And ye know the way whither I go. 
\v 5 Thomas saith to him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; how then do we know the way? 
\v 6 Jesus saith to him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one cometh to the Father but through me. 
\v 7 If ye knew me, ye would know my Father also; and from this time ye know him, and have seen him. 
\v 8 Philip saith to him, Lord, show us the Father, and we shall be satisfied. 
\v 9 Jesus saith to him, Have I been so long time with you, and dost thou not know me, Philip? He that hath seen me hath seen the Father; how is it that thou sayest, Show us the Father? 
\v 10 Dost thou not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I speak to you, I speak not from myself; but the Father, who dwelleth in me, doeth his works. 
\v 11 Believe me, that I am in the Father, and the Father in me; but if not, believe for the very works' sake. 
\v 12 Truly, truly do I say to you, He that believeth in me, the works that I do shall he do also, and greater than these shall he do; because I am going to the Father, 
\v 13 and whatever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do; that the Father may be glorified in the Son. 
\v 14 If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it. 
\v 15 If ye love me, ye will keep my commandments; 
\v 16 and I will pray the Father, and he will give you another Comforter, that he may be with you for ever; 
\v 17 the Spirit of truth, which the world cannot receive, because it doth not behold it, nor know it; ye know it, because it abideth with you, and will be in you. 
\v 18 I will not leave you bereaved; I am coming to you. 
\v 19 Yet a little while, and the world beholdeth me no more; but ye will behold me, because I live, and ye will live. 
\v 20 In that day ye will know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you. 
\v 21 He that hath my commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me; and he that loveth me will be loved by my Father; and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him. 
\v 22 Judas, not Iscariot, saith to him, And how is it, Lord, that thou art going to manifest thyself to us, and not to the world? 
\v 23 Jesus answered and said to him, If any one loveth me, he will keep my word; and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our abode with him. 
\v 24 He that loveth me not, keepeth not my words; and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's who sent me. 
\v 25 These things have I spoken to you, while abiding with you; 
\v 26 but the Comforter, the Holy Spirit which the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all things which I have said to you. 
\v 27 Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you; not as the world giveth, do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, nor let it be afraid. 
\v 28 Ye heard me say to you, I am going away, and am coming again to you. If ye loved me, ye would have rejoiced that I go to the Father; for the Father is greater than I. 
\v 29 And now I have told you before it hath come to pass, that when it hath come to pass ye may believe. 
\v 30 I shall not talk much more with you. For the prince of the world cometh, and hath nothing in me. 
\v 31 But [[this must be]] that the world may know that I love the Father, and that as the Father gave me commandment so I do. Arise, let us go hence. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1 I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. 
\v 2 Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away; and every branch that beareth fruit he cleanseth, that it may bear more fruit. 
\v 3 Ye are clean already, by reason of the word which I have spoken to you. 
\v 4 Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, if it abide not in the vine, so neither can ye, unless ye abide in me. 
\v 5 I am the vine, ye are the branches. He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit; for apart from me ye can do nothing. 
\v 6 If any one abideth not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather it, and cast it into the fire, and it is burned. 
\v 7 If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever ye will, and it shall be done for you. 
\v 8 Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; and ye will become my disciples. 
\v 9 As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you; abide in my love. 
\v 10 If ye keep my commandments, ye will abide in my love, even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love. 
\v 11 These things have I spoken to you, that my joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be made full. 
\v 12 This is my commandment, that ye love one another, as I have loved you. 
\v 13 Greater love hath no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends. 
\v 14 Ye are my friends, if ye do what I command you. 
\v 15 No longer do I call you servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things which I have heard from my Father, I have made known to you. 
\v 16 Ye did not choose me, but I chose you, and appointed you, that ye should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain; that whatever ye ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you. 
\v 17 This I command you, that ye love one another. 
\v 18 If the world hateth you, ye know that it hath hated me before it hated you. 
\v 19 If ye were of the world, the world would love its own; but because ye are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. 
\v 20 Remember what I said to you, A servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my words, they will keep yours also. 
\v 21 But all these things will they do to you on account of my name, because they know not him that sent me. 
\v 22 If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin. 
\v 23 He that hateth me, hateth my Father also. 
\v 24 If I had not done among them the works which no other man hath done, they would not have sin; but now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father. 
\v 25 But this cometh to pass, that the word may be fulfilled that is written in their Law: “They hated me without a cause.” 
\v 26 When the Comforter is come, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he will bear witness of me. 
\v 27 And ye also are witnesses, because ye have been with me from the beginning. 
\c 16  
\p
\v 1 These things have I spoken to you, that ye may not fall away. 
\v 2 They will put you out of the synagogues; yea, the hour is coming when every one that killeth you will think that he is offering sacrifice to God. 
\v 3 And these things will they do, because they neither know the Father nor me. 
\v 4 But I have spoken these things to you, that, when the time cometh, ye may remember that I myself told you of them. But these things I told you not at the beginning, because I was with you. 
\v 5 But now I go to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou? 
\v 6 But because I have spoken these things to you, sorrow hath filled your hearts. 
\v 7 But I tell you the truth; it is expedient for you that I depart. For if I do not depart, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you. 
\v 8 And when he is come, he will bring conviction to the world, of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment. 
\v 9 Of sin, because they believe not in me; 
\v 10 of righteousness, because I go to the Father, and ye see me no more; 
\v 11 of judgment, because the prince of this world hath been judged. 
\v 12 I have yet many things to say to you, but ye cannot bear them now. 
\v 13 But when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all the truth. For he will not speak from himself, but whatever he shall hear, that he will speak; and he will tell you the things to come. 
\v 14 He will glorify me, for he will receive of what is mine, and will tell it to you. 
\v 15 Every thing that the Father hath is mine. For this cause I said, that he receiveth of what is mine, and will tell it to you. 
\v 16 A little while, and ye no longer behold me; and again a little while, and ye will see me. 
\v 17 Some of his disciples therefore said to one another, What is this that he saith to us, A little while, and ye behold me not, and again a little while, and ye will see me? and, Because I go to the Father? 
\v 18 They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? We do not know what he is speaking of. 
\v 19 Jesus knew that they were desirous of asking him, and said to them, Is it of this that ye are inquiring of one another, that I said, A little while, and ye behold me not, and again a little while, and ye will See me? 
\v 20 Truly, truly do I say to you, that ye will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; ye will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy. 
\v 21 A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come; but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, through joy that a man is born into the world. 
\v 22 So ye also now have sorrow; but I shall see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and your joy no one taketh from you. 
\v 23 And in that day ye will ask nothing of me. Truly, truly do I say to you, Whatever ye shall ask the Father, he will give it you in my name. 
\v 24 Hitherto ye have asked nothing in my name; ask, and ye will receive, that your joy may be made full. 
\v 25 These things I have spoken to you in parables. The time is coming, when I shall no more speak to you in parables, but shall tell you plainly of the Father. 
\v 26 In that day ye will ask in my name; and I do not tell you that I will pray the Father for you; 
\v 27 for the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came forth from God. 
\v 28 I came forth from the Father, and have come into the world; again, I leave the world, and go to the Father. 
\v 29 His disciples say, Lo! now thou speakest plainly, and speakest no parable. 
\v 30 Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any one should ask thee; by this we believe that thou camest forth from God. 
\v 31 Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe? 
\v 32 Behold, the hour is coming, yea, is now come, when ye will be scattered, every one to his own, and will leave me alone; and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me. 
\v 33 These things I have spoken to you, that in me ye may have peace. In the world ye have tribulation; but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world. 
\c 17  
\p
\v 1 When Jesus had thus spoken, he lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father! the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that the Son may glorify thee; 
\v 2 according as thou gavest him authority over all flesh, that he should give everlasting life to all whom thou hast given him. 
\v 3 And this is the everlasting life, to know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou didst send. 
\v 4 I have glorified thee on the earth, having finished the work which thou gavest me to do; 
\v 5 and now, Father! do thou glorify me with thyself, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was. 
\v 6 I manifested thy name to the men whom thou gavest me out of the world. Thine they were, and thou gavest them to me; and they have kept thy word. 
\v 7 Now they know that all things whatever thou hast given me are from thee; 
\v 8 for I have given to them the words which thou hast given me; and they received them, and knew surely that I came forth from thee, and believed that thou didst send me. 
\v 9 I pray for them; I pray not for the world, but for those whom thou hast given me; for they are thine; 
\v 10 and all things that are mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them. 
\v 11 And I am no longer in the world; and they are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father! keep them in thy name which thou hast given me, that they may be one, even as we are. 
\v 12 While I was with them, I kept them in thy name which thou hast given me, and guarded them; and no one of them is lost except the son of perdition, that the Scripture may be fulfilled. 
\v 13 But now I come to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy made full in them. 
\v 14 I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. 
\v 15 I do not pray thee to take them out of the world, but to keep them from evil. 
\v 16 They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. 
\v 17 Sanctify them in thy truth; thy word is truth. 
\v 18 As thou didst send me into the world, I also sent them into the world. 
\v 19 And in their behalf I sanctify myself, that they also may be sanctified in the truth. 
\v 20 Yet not for these alone do I pray, but also for those who believe in me through their word; 
\v 21 that they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me and I in thee, that they also may be in us, that the world may believe that thou didst send me. 
\v 22 And the glory which thou hast given me, I have given them, that they may be one, even as we are one; 
\v 23 I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one, that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me. 
\v 24 Father! as to that which thou hast given me, I desire that they also be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me; for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world. 
\v 25 Righteous Father! and yet the world knew thee not! but I knew thee, and these knew that thou didst send me. 
\v 26 And I made known to them thy name, and will make it known; that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.

\p
\v 1 When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples across the brook Kedron, where was a garden, into which he entered with his disciples. 
\v 2 And Judas also, his betrayer, knew the place; because Jesus often resorted thither with his disciples. 
\v 3 Judas then, having received the band of soldiers, and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with torches and lanterns and weapons. 
\v 4 But Jesus, knowing all things that were coming upon him, went forth, and saith to them, Whom do ye seek? 
\v 5 They answered him, Jesus the Nazarene. Jesus saith to them, I am he. Now Judas also, his betrayer, was standing with them. 
\v 6 As soon then as he said to them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground. 
\v 7 Again therefore he asked them, Whom do ye seek? And they said, Jesus the Nazarene. 
\v 8 Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he. If therefore ye are seeking me, let these men go. 
\v 9 That the saying might be fulfilled which he spoke, “Of those whom thou hast given me, I have lost none.” 
\v 10 Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and smote the servant of the high-priest, and cut off his right ear. And the servant's name was Malchus. 
\v 11 Jesus therefore said to Peter, Put up the sword into the sheath. The cup which the Father hath given me, shall I not drink it? 
\v 12 So the band and the captain, and the officers of the Jews, took Jesus and bound him, 
\v 13 and carried him to Annas first; for he was father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high-priest that year. 
\v 14 And it was Caiaphas who counseled the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people. 
\v 15 And Simon Peter and the other disciple followed Jesus. That disciple was an acquaintance of the high-priest, and went with Jesus into the court of the palace of the high-priest. 
\v 16 But Peter was standing outside at the door. The other disciple therefore, who was an acquaintance of the high-priest, went out and spoke to her that kept the door, and brought in Peter. 
\v 17 Then the maid-servant that kept the door saith to Peter, Art thou also one of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not. 
\v 18 And the servants and the officers were standing there, having made a fire of coals, for it was cold, and were warming themselves; and Peter was standing with them and warming himself. 
\v 19 The high-priest then asked Jesus about his disciples, and about his teaching. 
\v 20 Jesus answered him, I have spoken plainly to the world; I always taught in a synagogue and in the temple, where all the Jews assemble, and in secret I spoke nothing. 
\v 21 Why askest thou me? Ask those who have heard, what I have spoken to them; behold, these know what I have said. 
\v 22 And when he had said this, one of the officers who was standing by struck Jesus on the face, saying, Is it thus that thou answerest the high-priest? 
\v 23 Jesus answered him, If I spoke what is evil, testify to the evil; but if well, why dost thou strike me? 
\v 24 Annas therefore sent him bound to Caiaphas the high-priest. 
\v 25 And Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. So they said to him, Art thou also one of his disciples? He denied and said, I am not. 
\v 26 One of the servants of the high-priest, being a kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him? 
\v 27 Then Peter denied again; and immediately a cock crew. 
\v 28 Then they lead Jesus from Caiaphas to the governor's palace; and it was early. And they did not themselves go into the palace, that they might not be defiled, but might eat the passover. 
\v 29 Pilate therefore went out to them, and saith, What accusation do ye bring against this man? 
\v 30 They answered and said to him, If he had not been doing evil, we would not have delivered him up to thee. 
\v 31 Pilate therefore said to them, Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said to him, It is not lawful for us to put any one to death. 
\v 32 That the words of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spoke, signifying what kind of death he was to die. 
\v 33 Pilate therefore went into the palace again, and called Jesus, and said to him, Art thou the King of the Jews? 
\v 34 Jesus answered, Dost thou say this of thyself, or did others tell thee concerning me? 
\v 35 Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thy own nation and the chief priests delivered thee up to me. What hast thou done? 
\v 36 Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, my servants would have fought, that I should not be delivered up to the Jews; but now is my kingdom not from hence. 
\v 37 Pilate therefore said to him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest what is true; for I am a king. For this end have I been born, and for this cause have I come into the world, that I may bear witness to the truth. Every one that is of the truth listeneth to my voice. 
\v 38 Pilate saith to him, What is truth? And having said this, he went out again to the Jews, and saith to them, I find nothing criminal in him. 
\v 39 But ye have a custom that I should release to you one at the passover: do ye desire, therefore, that I release to you the king of the Jews? 
\v 40 Then they cried out again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber. 
\c 19  
\p
\v 1 Then therefore Pilate took Jesus and scourged him. 
\v 2 And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and put on him a purple robe, and approached him 
\v 3 and said, Hail, king of the Jews! and they gave him blows on the face. 
\v 4 Again Pilate went forth, and saith to them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find nothing criminal in him. 
\v 5 Jesus therefore came forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And [[Pilate]] saith to them, Behold the man! 
\v 6 When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify! crucify! Pilate saith to them, Take him yourselves, and crucify him; for I find nothing criminal in him. 
\v 7 The Jews answered him, We have a law, and according to the law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God. 
\v 8 When Pilate therefore heard this, he was the more afraid; 
\v 9 and went again into the palace, and saith to Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer. 
\v 10 Pilate saith to him, Dost thou not speak to me? Dost thou not know that I have power to release thee, and have power to crucify thee? 
\v 11 Jesus answered, Thou wouldst have no power against me, unless it had been given thee from above; for this cause he that delivered me up to thee hath the greater sin. 
\v 12 From this time Pilate sought to release him. But the Jews cried out, saying, If thou release this man, thou art not a friend of Caesar. Every one that maketh himself a king, setteth himself against Caesar. 
\v 13 When therefore Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down on the judgment-seat, in a place called the Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha. 
\v 14 Now it was the preparation of the passover. It was about the sixth hour. And he saith to the Jews, Behold your king! 
\v 15 Upon this they cried out, Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him! Pilate saith to them, Shall I crucify your king? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar. 
\v 16 Then therefore he delivered him up to them to be crucified. They therefore took Jesus; 
\v 17 and bearing his own cross, he went forth into the place called Place of a Skull; in Hebrew, Golgotha; 
\v 18 where they crucified him, and with him two others, one on each side, and Jesus in the midst. 
\v 19 And Pilate wrote an inscription also, and put it on the cross. And the writing was, “Jesus the Nazarene, the king of the Jews.” 
\v 20 This inscription therefore was read by many of the Jews; for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek. 
\v 21 Therefore the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, Write not, The king of the Jews; but that he said, I am king of the Jews. 
\v 22 Pilate answered, What I have written, I have written. 
\v 23 Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part, and also his coat. Now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout. 
\v 24 They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be. That the scripture might be fulfilled: “They parted my garments among them, and for my vesture they cast lots.” These things the soldiers did. 
\v 25 Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary the Magdalene. 
\v 26 Jesus therefore, when he saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing by, saith to his mother, Woman, behold thy son! 
\v 27 Then he saith to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home. 
\v 28 After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now finished, in order that the Scripture might be accomplished, saith, I thirst. 
\v 29 A vessel was brought full of vinegar; and putting a sponge filled with vinegar upon a stalk of hyssop, they raised it to his mouth. 
\v 30 When therefore he had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished! and he bowed his head, and yielded up his spirit. 
\v 31 The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies might not remain upon the cross on the sabbath, for that sabbath was a great day, besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away. 
\v 32 So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who was crucified with him. 
\v 33 But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was already dead, they broke not his legs; 
\v 34 but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and immediately there came out blood and water. 
\v 35 And he that hath seen hath borne witness, and his witness is true; and he knoweth that he saith what is true, that ye also may believe. 
\v 36 For these things came to pass, that the scripture might be fulfilled, “A bone of him shall not be broken.” 
\v 37 And again another scripture saith, “They shall look on him whom they pierced.” 
\v 38 And after this, Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but concealing it for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave him leave. They came therefore and took him away. 
\v 39 Nicodemus also, he who at the first went to him by night, came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds weight. 
\v 40 Then they took the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen cloths with the spices, as is the manner of the Jews in preparing for burial. 
\v 41 Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had ever been laid. 
\v 42 There then, on account of the Jews' preparation-day, they laid Jesus; for the tomb was at hand. 
\c 20  
\p
\v 1 But on the first day of the week Mary the Magdalene cometh early, while it was yet dark, to the tomb, and seeth that the stone had been taken away from the tomb. 
\v 2 She runneth therefore, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we know not where they have laid him. 
\v 3 Peter therefore went forth, and the other disciple, and they set out for the tomb. 
\v 4 And they ran both together; and the other disciple outran Peter, and came first to the tomb. 
\v 5 And stooping down, he seeth the linen cloths lying; but he did not go in. 
\v 6 Then cometh also Simon Peter following him, and he went into the tomb; and he beholdeth the linen cloths lying, 
\v 7 and the napkin that was about his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but folded up in a place by itself. 
\v 8 Then therefore went in also the other disciple, who came first to the tomb; and he saw, and believed. 
\v 9 For not even yet did they know the Scripture, that he must rise from the dead. 
\v 10 So the disciples went away again to their home. 
\v 11 But Mary was standing without by the tomb weeping. And as she wept, she stooped down into the tomb, 
\v 12 and beholdeth two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain. 
\v 13 And they say to her, Woman, why dost thou weep? She saith to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him. 
\v 14 Having said this, she turned back, and beheld Jesus standing; and knew not that it was Jesus. 
\v 15 Jesus saith to her, Woman, why dost thou weep? whom dost thou seek? She, supposing that it was the gardener, saith to him, Sir, if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away. 
\v 16 Jesus saith to her, Mary! She turned and saith to him in Hebrew, Rabboni! Which signifieth, Teacher! 
\v 17 Jesus saith to her, Touch me not; for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to my brethren, and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and my God and your God. 
\v 18 Mary the Magdalene cometh, bringing word to the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had said these things to her. 
\v 19 When therefore it was evening on that day, which was the first day of the week, and the doors where the disciples were had been shut for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them, Peace be to you! 
\v 20 And having said this, he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore were glad, when they saw the Lord. 
\v 21 Then he said to them again, Peace be to you! As the Father hath sent me, I also send you. 
\v 22 And having said this, he breathed on them, and saith to them, Receive the Holy Spirit. 
\v 23 Whosever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them; whosever ye retain, they are retained. 
\v 24 But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. 
\v 25 The other disciples therefore said to him, We have seen the Lord. But he said to them, Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the place of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I shall not believe. 
\v 26 And after eight days the disciples were again within, and Thomas with them. Jesus cometh, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be to you! 
\v 27 Then he saith to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands, and reach forth thy hand, and put it into my side; and be not faithless, but believing. 
\v 28 Thomas answered and said to him, My Lord and my God! 
\v 29 Jesus saith to him, Because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed; blessed are they who have not seen, and yet have believed. 
\v 30 Many other signs did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book. 
\v 31 But these have been written, that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God, and that believing ye may have life in his name. 
\c 21  
\p
\v 1 After these things he manifested himself again to the disciples at the lake of Tiberias. And he manifested himself in this manner. 
\v 2 There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana of Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples. 
\v 3 Simon Peter saith to them, I am going a fishing. They say to him, We also will go with thee. They set out and went into the boat, and on that night caught nothing. 
\v 4 But when the morning was coming on, Jesus stood on the shore; but the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. 
\v 5 Then Jesus saith to them, Children, have ye any fish? They answered him, No. 
\v 6 And he said to them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and ye will find. And they cast it, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of the fishes. 
\v 7 Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith to Peter, It is the Lord. Simon Peter therefore, hearing that it was the Lord, girded on his outer garment, for he had on nothing but his under one, and threw himself into the lake. 
\v 8 And the other disciples came in the boat, (for they were not far from land, only about two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with the fishes. 
\v 9 When therefore they had come to land, they see a fire of coals there, and a fish lying thereon, and bread. 
\v 10 Jesus saith to them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught. 
\v 11 Simon Peter therefore went on board, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, a hundred and fifty three; and though there were so many, the net was not broken. 
\v 12 Jesus saith to them, Come and breakfast. But no one of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord. 
\v 13 Jesus cometh and taketh the bread, and giveth them, and the fish likewise. 
\v 14 This is now the third time that Jesus manifested himself to his disciples, after he had risen from the dead. 
\v 15 So when they had breakfasted, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of John, lovest thou me more than these? He saith to him, Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. He saith to him, Feed my lambs. 
\v 16 He saith to him again a second time, Simon, son of John, lovest thou me? He saith to him, Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. He saith to him, Tend my sheep. 
\v 17 He saith to him the third time, Simon, son of John, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said to him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith to him, Feed my sheep. 
\v 18 Truly, truly do I say to thee, when thou wast young, thou didst gird thyself, and walk whither thou wouldst; but when thou hast grown old, thou wilt stretch forth thy hands, and another will gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldst not. 
\v 19 This he said, signifying by what manner of death he was to glorify God. And having thus spoken, he saith to him, Follow me. 
\v 20 Peter, turning round, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following,—who also at supper leaned back on his breast, and said, Lord, who is he that betrayeth thee?— 
\v 21 Peter, seeing him, saith to Jesus, Lord, and how will it be with him? 
\v 22 Jesus saith to him, If it be my will that he remain till I come, what is it to thee? Follow thou me. 
\v 23 This report therefore went abroad among the brethren, that this disciple was not to die. And yet Jesus did not say to him, He will not die; but, If it be my will that he remain till I come, what is it to thee? 
\v 24 This is the disciple who testifieth of these things, and hath written these things; and we know that his testimony is true.
